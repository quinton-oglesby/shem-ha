K: Fair fair, thanks anyway
K: Sorry to ask this again but, have there been considerations for PluralKit? I'm here occasionally and it'd be super useful and appreciated
not sure how I feel about people using it for rp but that'll be for <#336297840529899522> if people want to know
possibly add pluralkit bot? not absolutely essential since it's mostly just me who talks here but could be useful from time to time and would be much appreciated
is rad asking because he wants more dmjii
as in
more dmjii emotes?
thanks!
<@&336302034070536192> is it possible to get fae/faer and they/them for pronoun roles? Sorry don't know what channel this request should be in
You know I'm rarely here :p
Shh
I didn't even realise
Ah shit this channel exists?
wholesome
these are super good
German and Dutch?
never heard that before, interesting
you really did
wow
mom
Wait shit
DziÄ™ki bardzo
lmfao
it's pretty much the same as saying someone is white or black
it was kinda like just this stigmatised thing we vaguely knew about
weren't really told anything about it either
or rather unit from the course
ideas from mgs2 were p interesting especially since it related to our social psychology course
fellow mgs fan?
ðŸ‘€
cya!
works for us
sexuality is a fuck

I think
it's a book
(age 17-18, college isn't the same as uni in the UK)
w o w we touched on lgbt sex ed in college
is it really that bad
it always sounds like everyone else got like no sex education ever
while bigoted is the attitude someone has
discriminative referring to actual actions, like a discriminative policy or whatever
I think it's just the different contexts of the word
also nice another server that doesn't like contra too much
yeah that's beyond just "oh I made a mistake by accident"
I just looked at the thread
not intentionally ableist btw I just meant sometimes missing things because I don't actually have to experience it as an issue
not everyone in the left is disabled so that's a thing that happens
I can be sometimes, it's easy to forget when you're not like the one experiencing it
you might not know everything, but you would probably know if something feels bad
don't rebel for the sake of it but don't just go with the wind either
it's more about like, yeah listen to others but then see how you feel about what they actually said
everyone does it, we all get our ideas from somewhere. I think it's very rare that anyone comes up with a completely original opinion, and even then it's probably still based off of other people
idk you that well but it feels like you base a lot of what you feel you should do based on what others have said
you just kinda have to think about how you feel about certain things in your personal life and then think about how you would feel about the different ways politics would affect it, I find that to be the easiest way to find a position
well apart from that just gonna say politics can be confusing especially when there's no objective truth
isn't Lectic young tho
Other than to say how it would be in their self-interest
Because if you come across someone who doesn't give a shit about anyone, there's no way to convince them of your ideology
I think it's kinda important to have your ideology have that kind of basis
At least, I don't feel my current political stance is mutually exclusive with that perspective
I meant my opinion wouldn't be contradictory to it
No I meant if you somehow "proven" that no one matters
Yes, I genuinely do care about others and do what I do because I like to help. But at the same time, if you said to me "no one matters and you should only care about yourself" I would still continue as I am now because I believe it benefits me in a self-interested way too
And in the same sense, I would be doing my part because "if I stop providing healthcare for the farmer, factory worker and builder now, they're going to stop making my food, clothes, technology and housing"
Let's say if we strip away any "because I want what's right and for people to feel good" from my own political beliefs, then we could say "I want people to be supported so they can make my clothes, food, luxuries etc and they can't do that if they're all dying"
In the sense that, one person cannot survive alone and accomplish everything necessary
I think even if you don't care about others, it still benefits to be interested  in others
This is why I couldn't call myself a pacifist. I won't openly support many conflicts at all and I might never. You might never see me personally commit an act of violence in the name of politics. But on the grand scale beyond my own life and power, I believe it's necessary for others to do so
But anyone who will not give in to *any* means at all, will not succeed
I think the extent to which someone is willing to give in to "means to an end" is the important part
Sometimes you have to make a few hypocritical or morally grey decisions to either control damage, protect your standing or make a gain
And people who make the claims of "that makes you just as bad as the other side" are the ones who lose at politics
I don't believe *everything* can be sat down and talked together over. It's what I would want to be the first try and option but there has to be contingency plans
The question is, how much of that integrity and values you sacrifice
I think there is some pragmatic sense to political ideology and strategy. You cannot get the whole world on your side and be absolutely morally pure and maintain 100% integrity. At some point, you'll have to sacrifice some of your values for political strategy
nobody agrees on anything and sometimes the things they don't agree on are harmful
what's right for everyone is unfortunately complicated
you could be against gun control and be either left or right and many other issues that aren't really determined by how far left/right or libertarian/authoritarian you are
political views are too nuanced to really be explained in just one scale
it's not entirely accurate but can be p fun
have you taken the compass test
E.g. Spanish civil war
The biggest downside of communism is that the worst enemy of communists are themselves
But just remember that you're under no obligation to stick around or do anything that makes you uncomfortable
See what happens I guess
I'd love to stay and help but I'm actually really tired and will sleep for real. I hope you manage to sort this out
It's quite clear and there's no ambiguity to it
Yeah I'd say go for it
Clear and to the point
Asserting clear boundaries is important and if he won't respect that, it's his issue and not your fault
~~I know I said I'd sleep but yeah~~
Good message, I'd say
OK yeah, I meant romantic to clarify
People aren't entitled to such things
As in, saying "I love you" to each other and everything but I don't think that obligates either of us to *have* to be in a relationship
I mean I have a friend who we're *really* affectionate with
If he seems to be guilt tripping you into feeling bad for it, that raises a lot of red flags to me
Then that's fine
And you don't consider it one
If you're not interested in a relationship
This is raising multiple red flags to me
I just read through this and
Right
I understand you weren't trying to be offensive
I really appreciate you trying to stand up for us Matt, and I also really appreciate the apology Aria
Can we all chill?
And I appreciate the apology
Aria, I don't think you're a terrible person or anything
Then again you live in the US so no idea how possible that actually is
But if it's an issue that you feel affects your life significantly, then it's never a bad idea to try and do something about it
I can't really do a whole lot since I'm not a health professional
As opposed to just not caring at all
Maybe that's bad wording. I meant, wanting to do something but just not being able to find the energy or interest
Lacking motivation?
Is it generally just a feeling of dissatisfaction with everything?
I'm happy to continue if you want
Decentralised councils when
Personally, I'd see that as an argument for devolution of power
Interesting take
So I get that it won't be universally applicable
Rather than an abstract idea of who "the left" are
My opinion is mostly from experience with sectarian groups
I think I get your point, yeah
I'm fully aware of that
I'm not sure if we're on the same page
I mean divisiveness within the left, not between the left and right
Which is why I focused more on direct action communities rather than ideological
I'm not saying unity isn't possible, but divisiveness is a thing when it comes to ideology
Having said that, it's still fun on occasion
I don't think there's much to be gained from debating Marx with people on reddit. Joining a union and fighting for fair wages and rent on the other hand
I don't care much for ideology nowadays. I just know what I want in terms of practical issues, and what I want to do about it
Sometimes the means and ends of the ideologies are incompatible
True but a lot of divisiveness happens with the left
I've kept a few toxic people around in the past and it only worked out worse in the long-term
I know it's difficult to cut people off, but sometimes it's healthier
Very yikes
Yeah that's yikes
Idk, if it's making you uncomfortable then there must be an issue?
What's up Lectic?
But conversely, you can take an existence vacation and then find CW: suicide, overdose ||aspirin pills stocked on your table||
It's nice to sort of take an existence vacation and then find out someone's done the dishes for you
But yeah. I didn't ask for this, but it's not terrible all the time
PDD-NOS seems to be decent comparison? Idk much about it
Doesn't Aria use she/her?
I generally have mixed feelings about it. I didn't ask for this, but I might as well make the most of it while it's a thing
Yeah basically
It's alright I guess. It probably sounds cool to some people but there's also downsides that some people don't consider
We could get philosophical here and say "what makes a person" but I'm not really in the mood for that kind of conversation right now
Plurality is an umbrella term for multiple people in one brain/body. I guess you could say it's a neurodivergency and is quite varied. Personally, I believe it's because of a shitty life history
DMs are open if you need to
I'm confused as to what's going on now wtf
There's one rewording
"I'm not familiar enough with the nuances of DID to immediately know if someone is "DID" or something else"
You alright Aria?
There was a better way to word it, but the apology is accepted
Please, we didn't want a fight to start because of us
It just looks manipulative tbh
It really does feel like he's trying to lead you into a response he wants
What the actual fuck
Late to this but
yeah I agree with Matt
I hate to say it but
but even when I did I still didn't show a pic
I don't live with my parents so ig that contributes lmao
really does sound sus tbh
even with close friends I don't show my parents what they look like for no reason
yeah tbh
not got a webcam so maybe I could be fine, nobody can see me
everything is gendered, even more with German
just remembered why I hadn't signed up for language lessons for a while
ig if you say "antifa" then you can just broadly declare anyone who's at a rally, regardless of whether they actually belong to a group
unaffiliated with each other
they're literally just a load of different organisations at the same place
multiple ones before
been to an "antifa" rally before
update: looks like the list was actually recalled because they realised how dumb it was
literally as bad as national front
but I don't think anti-nuke groups are like
tbf right wing groups are on there as well
(slight sarcasm)
PETA but tbh I'm not entirely against that lmao
stop the war coalition
campaign against arms trade is also a terrorist organisation
not to mention campaign for nuclear disarmament was also on that list
was declared an extremist group
you turn up and exercise, that's it
run by left wing people but it literally just operated like any other gym
but literally you turn up and maybe box for a bit
it was a left-leaning gym
and a gym I went to was declared terrorist
literally a police list got released
in the uk everyone is a terrorist organisation
or anarcho-mutualist or smth similar?
market socialist?
yeah ik that wasn't specifically at you but rather a general point
even if someone agrees with your point just now that's not a "checkmate socialists"
either way, capitalism isn't the be all end all
free markets /= capitalism
from a less ownership based structure to a more labour based structure
it's how it works now but what I'm proposing is just moving people around the structure
re-read your message
oh
I'm simplifying it here but
or another group says if you clean their toilets you'll get that guitar/tv/pc you want from them
what about if I told you I'll give you food if you do
co-operation is significantly more efficient for everyone involved than going it alone, so there are selfish reasons to co-operate too
because one person can't produce all the essentials and luxuries they might want alone
but even then, if not compassion, it's helpful to be fair to others, get others to like you and help them survive
this is a whole debate in social psychology because you could argue people are compassionate for selfish reasons
what submarine said
taking a step closer towards TRANShumanism
more like
mutilate?
but usually not to get drunk
don't really drink too often
drink taste is actually fine
whether that's good or bad isn't what I'm trying to say, just saying blm is very diverse and I doubt all take the view rn of "no peaceful solution"
not my place to tell black people who or how they express their voice but I have seen videos of some speaking to a rally of trump supporters, attempting to reach the cops or whatever else
the thing about blm though is that I don't think everyone understands that since it's made up of such a mix of different kinds of people
no one is free from marxism
ig the whole world is marxist now
Marxism is when you resist against China
but from the sounds of it, doesn't seem like the case here
one way I can see this being fine is if someone just doesn't like romantic scenes in general
do they mind romance in general
not all affection is yuri and if there's no affection whatsoever then good luck
kinda inconvenient and unnecessary imo
so we could actually get into uni in the first place
things got better after coming to uni but that only happened because there was a balance with college
things mostly got better from a change of environment but like you need to make sure you can get in a good position for that
we've (as Armis) have generally noticed you talk a lot like how we used to and stuff so we're not like entirely unfamiliar with all that
i got asked for specifics and elaboration and just kinda went aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa and word vomited
for all I know this could just be i just woke up and i'm tired rambling
idk I just woke up
accepting that something that's considered "normal" probably isn't that simple
probably making an obvious point here but basically ig it's perspectives that have to fit the science, not the science to fit the perspectives
concepts taken for granted as obvious and natural are sometimes shown to be fragile
the fact that the embryo is unique and has potential to be human life, that already throws people into a debate on what makes a person
hell, even moving away from modification of any form, just talking about embryos
if you implant someone with a chip, all sorts of people will start debating if that person is human anymore
let's look at transhumanism for that
I say "more than one brain" and not "more than one person" because I think the second is an entirely different concept
I mean imo there's always only one consciousness, maybe for us just different parts of the brain fire up and give the impression that there's more than one brain
and what does this mean for questions of stuff like consciousness and personhood if parts of the brain can be relatively disconnected
but how do people who have had no physical injury or condition manage to experience amnesia
especially when we start to consider the possibility that "connection" isn't necessarily always biological (or maybe it is idk I haven't done brain scans)
it's weird but also interesting to like speculate how exactly connections in the brain works
but this alongside other neuropsychological stuff (e.g. brain damage patients)
probably less to do with both halves being literally fully functioning alone (because they're not, the video still doesn't really claim that)
just thought it seemed interesting even if not entirely accurate
<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377>
fell asleep
sorry i went to lay down and
what the hell
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wfYbgdo8e-8
assuming even if someone lived with their clone for their whole lives, they would still experience everything from two different perspectives
even if you copy the memories and stuff there'll be a point where they're not the same people though
or rather was the end point
my curiosity was mostly questioning how "normalising" works
talking about plural stuff gets a little fucky for me so I might not have full energy for that
the case for discrimination will still be made on those grounds
because let's assume that everything were nature and that we proven that they just can't change
tbh when it comes to ethics I think it's less of a question of nature or nurture
why
what
Sabaton I mean, I haven't seen Van Canto
They were really cool live
