ascendance of a bookworm LN spoilers
|| https://twitter.com/RyanMakise/status/1618735722403610630 ||
no they gotta do it while singing for the hype
pull a saitama
just jump back to earth lol
i guess being on the moons no problem
fair enough
fair point
hmm
they were on a spaceship
now they gotta be able to survive reentry and landing
cool
so.. can they survive in space with their gear?
lets go ask an anthropologist
and asian
im 171cm
eventually the debris will form the moon
become a planet and get hit by another, smaller planet sized mass
easy solution
they should shrink it down and steal it
i was wondering if they were ever gonna mention that
elfnein seems to have some inkling as to what they did to tsubasa
XV Epilogue:
"Miku, remember when Shem-Ha possessed you and wore that dress? Would you mind wearing it from time to time, because that was pretty hot"
guys if im being honest, miku/shem-ha in that black dress is <:Sweating:285790609975803904>
im a little sad we didnt get big tiddy carol tbh
<:DemiDisgust:587211959619813376>
>noble red
just an endless loop of "Go ask your mother"
oh god imagine that
science babies
u wont understand what hes saying but thats only because of the curse of balal
Right
That hibiki punched
Wait K2 is the mountain
I think of the south korean K2 Black Panther main battle tank
When i think of K2
Same tbh
think shotgun, but from a tank gun
now what if they shot a canister round <a:think3d:449765442412609546>

u posted a jpg

"Maria's the key to all this."
hey thats pretty good
shirabe leaving kirika hanging with her reply for a whole season
wow
~~blasphemy~~
inb4 miku's personality leaks and shem-ha starts thirsting for hibiki
maybe shes just unconscious
mind battle
Physiologically is kinda different
u mean psychologically?
and more or less they didnt take active joy in it
the only difference is it happened off screen
fine, saint germain and prob carol have also killed tons of people
well
the hole puncher scene
oof
shes totally cool with killing people
and she literally says
with a person in it
who was standing on top of a car
she shot missiles at chris
she blew up the bridge
not for lack of trying
i mean
and at worst the orchestrater
elsa is at the very least complicit
inb4 miku's personality leaks and shem-ha starts thirsting for hibiki
I said this before but im just gonna repeat it
how much time passed since season 4 and season 5

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Lets see some divine yuri
I want shem-ha to develop hibiki thirst due to mikus personality leaking through
tbh i miss carol's bitchin hat

just saw the episode
good ol smear frames
wat
well maria is pretty good
<a:ChrisBaka:493803773001465866>
this is a cool detail because chris is an angel
and then immediately after that, chris appears
he called out for an angel
when the noise cornered that guy who was looking in on fudou's men and noble red making a deal
cool detail in XV
she brings shame to her slavic ancestors
hibiki gonna get shem-ha out of miku via *intense fisting*

i now give you my magnum opus
everyone
Hibili
~~Fine is like Genghis Khan in that a lot of people are descendants of her. She must have gotten around a lot.~~
<a:HibikiOraOra:582365734097780746> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

<a:acry:427497434437124107> its over

<@217408150901489666> we crossed that line long ago when we saw them sleeping and bathing together

SYMPHOGEAR XV: CAROL RETURNS
and
i tried finding carol's genocide song on youtube

<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>

LAND
OF
THE
LUSTROUS
havent played it
saying this as a guy who has no prior knowledge of the game
would be down to watch another episode
i liked it
not bad
Especially when the opposing faction is the goddamn Royal Navy and USN
Calling a faction that includes the Kriegsmarine "the true conqueror of the seas" is pretty generous lol
So Azur Lane
oh that one
*googles mondaiji tachi*
i read the LNs tho and they are <:okreina:410619889972150282>
<:NotLikeShall:587280007307591681>
cgi goblins and baby goats
oof lol
re zero is the only one i havent seen
no u
i didnt get around to it
look man
i liked them
since then ive seen/read overlord and saw youjo senki
i only saw konosuba
at the time isekai quartet aired
no
seeing as how popular they are
well
we already knew a second season was coming
no clue
*what if bakarina sets off an explosion of otome isekai*
bakarina?
endless numbers
ie hordes of men just charging and getting slaughtered
seems like theyre perpetuating the russian human wave myth
watching the youjo senki movie
<@139432096023183360> ive read the konosuba LNs
yar har matey
F
that sucks
damn
mind blown by episode 2

Kumo S2 OP
https://youtu.be/QHcy8OHcnrk
Time for another weekly feels fest
Got around to watching the first ep of the new fruits basket series
||RIP cool diva||
that vivy ep
fuuuuuuuuuuuck that fruits basket cliffhanger
||when tohru got close to the cliff i got *reeallyy* fuckin nervous||
fruits basket
on kumo
every week i curse the bad animation
<:pepeKEK:637451209896099880>
it turns out that the author for the manga adaptation hasnt even read the source material
another week, another butchering of spider by the anime
~~no wonder the manga is crap~~
i liked that ch too
they did land of the lustrous
imagine if they got studio orange to make this show
the human side was better
idk how theyll do the last one
and given how they scuffed the pacing, the plot and reveals in this ep
theres a certain point in the LNs where it would prob leave off
no i mean
idk how theyre gonna squeeze the rest of the stuff into the last episode
well
whatever u think the rest of the spider episode was
we got [LN] ||white|| speaking
and thats good enough for me
<a:KirikaSob:725756440463147048>
that vivy ep tho
I am once again lamenting how kumo got done dirty by the anime
||was this not just an april fools joke||
|| https://twitter.com/zombielandsaga/status/1245002917318279168 ||

https://i.redd.it/650g0qrx04e61.jpg

Almost done vol 5.1
Im making good progress on reading the WN
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
Woo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmcPAnztR4g
Hence "Taishou" in the title
Btw its set in the early 1920s
So im looking forward to watching it
The manga is really good

> Tamahiko Shima is the youngest son of the powerful and wealthy Shima family. Blessed with great fortune since his childhood, he grew up wanting nothing but affection from his oftentimes distant family.
> 
> After losing his mother and crippling his dominant arm in an accident, Tamahiko fell into deep despair and is cast aside by his own father for his handicap. Condemned to live isolated in the countryside where he would not bring shame to his family's name, he resigned himself to dying alone‚Äîuntil one day, a young girl named Yuzuki Tachibana appeared on his doorstep, proclaiming that Tamahiko's father sent her to be his bride.
> 
> As she takes care of Tamahiko, Yuzuki brings a feeling of springtime into Tamahiko's dreary life, allowing him to gradually heal from the deep emotional scars of his youth. Their lives slowly intertwine as both Tamahiko and Yuzuki taste the fruits of their first love.

and it looks like it might be a full adaptation
the manga is already completed
its called Taishou Otome Otogibanashi
i read it a while back and i loved it
im glad this manga got an adaption
lets fucking goooooooooo

Girls und Panzer Das Finale Part 3 subs are out
Or i could continue with the MT WN
Which is like 50+ volumes
I was considering 86, or maybe finally taking the dive into the toaru series
Trying to figure out what series to read next
Now that im caught up on mushoku tensei
Its cute
Ive read the manga for that
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
https://youtu.be/iWnHoFLp1jg
Ooh
Which explains why there havent been new TLs in months
I heard the manga got licensed
yea
so if the brits win this means the finale will be a rematch
but they lost vs the brits twice
thats the main series
one reason why people theorize the brits will win is because ooarai already beat the germans
GuP Das Finale part 4 PV

my bad
o
||this is getting kinda sus if you ask me||
||and does she know what hes talking about? what did she do||
hmmmmmmmmm
||what is he going on about||
||wonder if she will pick up on him acting differently, just this image alone he is acting way more smug||
||idk, how about showing him the bare minimum of basic human respect?||
||what a great first impression||
||oooof prospera not holding back with her words||
||coming off a bit strongly, prospera||
i guess its the former
or its just just an "en" sound and shes saying "miorine-nee san" or something
when suletta says "miorine-san" i cant tell if miorine is just pronounced with "neigh" at the end
same energy


no
