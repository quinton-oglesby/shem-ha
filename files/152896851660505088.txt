you can check on our player to see whats tld and whatnot  https://unlimited.poweris.moe
for everything else eh, there's pastebins around and you might want to pm raiden
like the aujii event soon™
well we only tl events if someone really loves it
Renovating house chris so everything is dusty and my room is what we are working on atm
Wish I had display cases
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i actually look at what tokuten i wanna get
i cancelled like 4ish times already without a problem
they're probably gonna be more strict with a new guy ordering something and then cancelling as opposed to someone who already had multiple orders paid and shipped and has to cancel for one or another reason.
it was functionable for what, at max a day.
never gonna get enabled again <:kappa:271347291934294037>
https://puu.sh/B2vlT.png
if unlucky they would still ban your account
they actually took the cancel function offline again
they still would
they're more flexible at it now
they dont really like people to cance lorders tho
yeah said that
which was what we are saying
yeah but it does happen
reruns would be listed under a different entry
sometimes its also just because people cancelled so they end up with some extra stock
yeah
few times
i have
amiami doesnt tend to restock so if you didnt po you usually are out of luck
wonder how hard theyll fuck the paintjob
the prototype looks fine for a bellfine fig at least
order is a rabbit
yuuki yuuna
datye a live, persona 5
i dont think the birthday sets have ever been on amiami
cool
thanks for reminding i need to mesage my friend to as kwhen he's shipping it

did someone say adds?
video from kako (JP)
<:15min:495770478678638593>
jp also has low dmg players dw

i should bully smoll carol
(jp) hmm, still took me 4 turns, gotta see if i can lower it
don't need carol for that, she just makes it easier bcs zetsu color and aoe
then you get that
and a damage taken increase
you debuff the boss with 100% def down
this is jp raid farming
this is what future raids can look like
<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
bcs you need like 3000s and more of each
they buffed the mats in jp because of super awakening
global has the improved drop for whatever reason
yeah haz
https://puu.sh/Fd30j.png
gues ill add that to the list of typo's for the mail im sending
>wrong tl
so you just need to farm mats for rank 5
and then use dupes for rank 2, 3 and 4 skipping all the material requirements
you can farm rank 1
this is also where extra dupes come in
for 1 skill at rank 4
thats 350 giga xd mats
for example
https://puu.sh/Fd38M.png
over 10skills
total that is
not bad
https://puu.sh/Fd4vU.png
ps we should move this to global
<:harold:364119409620418591>
pretty sure eh the actual welfare on events have higher bonus then the aot one
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
dont need to roll
just grab ther welfares from events for bonus
you're not supposed to roll every banner
yes
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
yeah sorry not yet
seal immunity <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
well everyting is reduced on normal
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
lol
i do have some decent reds so i might be able to do some dmg tho with 10cp <:LUL:243896110001684480>
jsut making sure i dont spawn the wrong one
tis the adult carol right?
i can spawn one and go to sleep
do you need normal carols?
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
~~normal is easy~~
the adds are dead on the normal
there's a normal and a hard carol spawned and now i g sleep
ok.....

🤔
hacks but doesnt clear the raid
you're still gonna hit more then a red that gets resisted anyway
depends if its spec/phys reducxtion
at least you deal neutral damage
i would if majority of my units werent red
~~gona be a lot better when people can solo them~~
yeah
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
and let alts spawn extra bosses for us
add eachother
what we did on jp was make alts
yeah gotta refresh and hope you get in another group
even on public its still gonna pop up for friends on top
public is the easiest ye
or they arent supposed to
they dont
sadly enough there isnt a way to change it later
i would assume so if you cant find it even with hard refreshing
either its open for friends only or for public
it depends on which option you took and even then you still gotta refresh
```i think it needs to be 3 hours or less to be visible publically
might be sub 3 hours actually```
nope
no
ue just wait till he wakes up
sanic
read the guide
wait
no
yes story ma1-10
to actually buffer them so people can mlb easily early on
3 guarantees later
3 guarantees now
they probably split them
ogawa is tied to an event so they cant run him
but those are not event units
its hard to gauge
<a:15min:490152508757508106>
or just before
iirc
after carol even
he's only a few months old
ogawa is like not happening any time soon
maria soon
<:RikoPeek:369481495640932355>
ill take a quick peek
so they can just run them whenever really
no event thats listed on the gear site
bcs its bikki <:15min:495770478678638593>
just rolling the bad rng on drops
its bcs that way we dont actually have to remember the names <:LUL:545650745534447631>
normals then
mega is tier 2 or tier 3?
but a few other units like hanabi said, testament, also uses them
yeah they originally came for adultverse
she applies it faster then serena her cd on sk1 afaik
but she cant cleanse it fast enough
yes
hitsuai duo shout
bcs of the song
hitsuai can win with good rng but dont bank on it
test solo's hitsuai
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
lol
so yeah
well glboal isnt gonna see the test killers
soon™
at least canipa knows what the fuck he talks about
its different but not garbage
oh here we go again the the sun and moon animation is garbage
Or just remove the large part but effort
blame twitter

<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
nobody cares on nipples on males in anime either
symphogear doesnt get human anatomy right either, they didnt draw the dick
this guy
>nipples
>males
in anime
look someone who doesnt know what he talks about <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
to actually have expressions in the show
theyve switched to more digital for pokemon
whic hwas the point
see xdu disc
yeah we got the skill datamined
They can just zoom out 😂
dokidoki is just a rip off from an older jp vn anyway
maybe theyre just males all along
Villains better
wonder if saucenao finds it back
thats what pixiv uses
https://puu.sh/A8uji.png
pixiv
Das lewd
XD
🤔
And its a country
Yes
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
Vatican City is still 13 confirmed
They haven't changed their age of consent yet but it generally is 16-18 now in japan
Nah
Age of consent is 13 <:chikacool:371438809440845834>
Jii is legal
^thats extreme
you can look at them on pc when you have no internet <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
they can do it tho, just dont have time
thats asking too much
evne if its bad cgi
the cgi helps it
m8 KF easily one of the best anime of 2017
shipping wars are bad
gotta play it nsfw
playing cm3d2 just for sfw stuff is meh
mmd isnt as clean iirc
KISS is polling popularity to release it in english
nah gonna wait tll the "sequel" is out.
no chris mod tho
i have it <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
is that game
custom maid 3d2
It's a porn game <:hillaryous:239169549512081409>

ye
the prototype looks better then the previous kirika and chris ones tbh
probably between 13k-15k jpy
bellfine so pretty high for a medium quality figure
whitestone might work
just fuck it and place a logo render over it <:thinkan:286255670649552897>
Budget well spend
Fujiko <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
Ye sure
Depends on who
<:thonkang:363820225067614218>
oh those kind of suits
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
saber is also a female and was a male
its fate
edison got fucking summoned as a lion
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
Lots of mashu lewds <:15min:495770478678638593>
Lewds
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
But thats nsfw
Dolphins
lmao
that cap is from wa2 which is unrelated to wa <:kappa:271347291934294037>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
but people feel entitled to also bitch about those if we get them in EN
there's also plenty of censorings thats from chink server itself
thats great
soo n™
<:kappa:281531248634232842>
louis is actually an alias
flip flappers
y
with the effects
<:15min:495770478678638593>

the smile is forever in our hearts
spaghetti legs <:15min:241820657027907584>
same
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and then watch the upcoming third one whenever that comes out
And live2d again for her lmao
And add a new wedding one for suomi next week
yeah
they dont really look at irl performance after all
they wont make her better tho <:15min:495770478678638593>
Oath everyone <:merchant:406865468255764511>
Who knows
🍌
pretty much yea
they share the same action director, and his quirks just show up in both
sort of
the action is actually similar
well
ye
it has something to do with data you can allocate to pictures
i know jeanne has her own heavenly ass tag but i dont remember what it was called
like heavenly ass <:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah
they change the system every so often
but who knows how pixiv really works <:15min:495770478678638593>
well it could also take into amount when the work was uploaded 
ie: work uploaded 8jan but didnt had tags, tags were added shows up on the page wit hthe rest of 8 jan pics
https://twitter.com/dododorigesu/status/1131891503318556673
https://puu.sh/DFvCu.png
and i still need to sort a lot of entries
im checking my pic folder and its still going
i know that feel kerrik
kerrik you're a madman
actually has them uploaded on drive
matsunaga > year > month 
                       >  rewards
my matsunaga folder is probably the most sorted
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://puu.sh/DFvP5.png thats where it ends for me
mine dont have any sorting besides the name o f the girl as folder
mine are honestly a mess
hehe
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
samne goes for you
saving images was a mistake
with gods knows how many pics
but like if i check yohane i need to filter 2000 folders
i filtered it to at least remove tags i dont want but the rest ill have to do manually
and i need to filter through my auto pixiv rips still
<:Yousoro7:356677867305697280>
check sgg we posted the 2 new ones
yes
so maria also in extend
well serena is
yes
https://twitter.com/akanekotwitte10/status/1051547448563265536?s=19
sec
i do
yea its a new japan trend
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
post the channel here bcs i likely have it muted
non geah spoilers?
ye
no?
just throw enough cash at it and they'll bite
Trigger likes western folks so I'm not exactly surprised they would do the op for an actual western dev game
then every anime studio would be independent which is just wrong
except they eh do
this hurts solo
<:harold:364119409620418591>
booru just mirrors other sites so i just go to the main sources to browse <a:15min:490152367631630346>
sometimes character(series)
filter whatever siet you browse on the charatcer tag
ka killed shirabe
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
and icons later bcs someone asked
You'll see if you open it
images only tho
https://mega.nz/#F!O0VghK5Z!Nu_QTgklzgDihSeTLpTjVw
I'm updating the mega this weekend with new cards
<:15min:495770478678638593>
grenadier
after the miku one
there's still a chance
nope out of stock
there might be some on hobbystock still tbh
does it work when its the same pic but different filename?
there's a few artists that take down their images after a while
had some dupes i didnt even realize were dupes
https://puu.sh/E2oJP.png
im just scanning the whole pic drive at once
thanks
oh can i have a link?
ye
she gets called budgetchris for a reason <:15min:495770478678638593>
<@!246146781832806401> the sg icon should be on it now btw
reminds me that mega keeps fucking up the auto upload
its rabbit day or something
you'll see a lot of bunny art popping up
hopefully
mega botched it
<@!263983345669505025> had to make a new mega link for the xdu folder
https://mega.nz/#F!y58iGazK!6Sq5XjpwS6qRpqpPuwaRDg
runa has been drawing a lot of not only kiris lately tbh
there's an edited tag so it was edited after
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
when its all of them together
the GX one is bigger
actually
oh god literal bikki hamster
its big but not as big as gx
https://puu.sh/Eactd.jpg
there's a whoel lot of sfx going on
hard to get a good shot for
what ep
https://puu.sh/Eacnd.png
really big
as in
andthat fist was pretty big iirc
GX is the one where they did the first time send all the gear power to bikki for ultimate attack
so no thats GX
its the lion punch
pls don't actually do it but we plan to do it
~~if you ping wing enough you'll get a tl eventually~~

school live is the best option
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
this makes more sense
the kirin set is called the doujin armor for a reason
well
its an elder dragon
still havent bothered with s2 of cg bcs its just meh
og > side M > CG
ye
<:bangablechris:296324963110092802>
<:harold:364119409620418591>
and the geah event was friday
but not in stores
tfw that's wholesome and is also a doujin that's not available to buy online <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
thanks now i cant unsee
so they went to pawoo
it just got more traffic bcs twitter started the ban artists for questionable content
pawoo has been around for a while
pixivs equivalent of twitter
solid plan
hey 5seconds is 5 seconds <:15min:495770478678638593>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
bcs it happens automatically instead of having to do it manually?
a jpeg format
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
chestnuts?
tried one with strawberry i think but didnt like it
i always either pick cream or chocolate
yeah
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
and i jsut keep my nitro so i can keep running my miku tag
ye agree with melua
https://puu.sh/EHP35.png
day 33 of the 18th month
kerrik probably lives somewhere where they have a special calendar
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
long pink hair
its seigfried <a:15min:490152250350501918>
yea its the armor
and so is the shield
also that cape is shield hero
not mami or so
its just the otufit
it doesnt really get in the way that much of the mecha parts
at least laser face is pretty easy to redraw
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://puu.sh/EItY1.png
sucks the logo has godzilla in the way
the others are based on said xdu designs
ye
its a kirara manga anyway so i dont really expect it to change much
looks like sea slugs
yes
<:harold:364119409620418591>
i forgot how big durandal was till johnny posted that one image
these are the originals scanned in so b/w
version A looks pretty nice tho
prototype miku v2 is close to the miku we have
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1224088942372364289?s=19
someone ripped it for us and uploaded them on nyaa
you should see proto-miku
<:15min:495770478678638593>
he "collabs" with us and shares for us first then Johnny posts some of the stuff on the ytt twitter and then he uploads to nyaa and mega iirc
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
well all of them we gave the ok
https://nyaa.si/user/gremlinroyale
sometimes it just takes a while for them to crack down on stuff
in terms of lolicon
twitter also changed their policy in 2018 and only started enforcing it last year
its ok, it got a laugh out of me
shirabe
<https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1252883668080549892>

she's bending her spine at the wrong angle
vlc jsut cant handly heavy typesetting which is every issue you listed boule
you pinged?
nice
<@!279341087494242304>
https://puu.sh/FLzr0.jpg
but do you want the full image
based nabe
is what i think he tried going for
the background is basically seeing what miku is seeing
```Miku Kohinata from Senki Zesshou Symphogear reaching out for the sun.  You can see a silhouette of Hibiki Tachibana in the sun.```
is what i said for the comm iirc
miku reaching for the sun that has bikki in it

the actual units itself of her tend to have different eye colors
to be consistent
they updated all of the miku sprites though
it doesnt really look nsfw besides big tits
at snails pace
slow but surely
lmao
our TLs are mostly working on the live stuff
manga moves very slow
ive been waiting for ~1year now to typeset soemthing for ytt <:LUL:545650745534447631>
as long as i dont have to redraw
im always free to typeset something btw <:15min:655058014495047690>

no <:15min:655058014495047690>

https://twitter.com/mmmy_poko3/status/1319248853581746177
same
thats the story behidn those 2 pics
the og tweet was deleted
```tl;dr someone commed shiramiku but the artist first drew a picture with the characters reversed, realized his mistake, drew a second picture with the characters the right way, then realized the original request was supposed to be NSFW but he's not a shipper so he just refunded the money and went home```
the context behind it is pretty eh tho
"dead"

text outside of boxes/bubbles <:harold:671899719940833291>
yeah but that yields no results <:15min:655058014495047690>
just a space works iirc
yeah
assuming its tagged properly
sfw link version

yeah some are quite good, this one not so much
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
when its digital raws but they're still shit
but the cleaning is so unfun, so much artifacts
that said i should finish the stand by you one before the end of the year
they drilled it in back in the day when i was in a scanlation group
i'm just teached to not go outside of the bubbles unless you can't solve it by any other means
oh i know that feel dw
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>

<@279341087494242304>


eh like
bikki and miku doing a boob press holding hands with wedding rings on charging an attack against an unknown foe.  (see the shadows). design based on prev comm with bikki having an altered design due to having accepted shemmiku power, see the ssj mirrors in her cape.

incorporate the aufwachen of the other gear users in the attack. add broken  amalgam weapons of the others in the background.
minute, gotta fix something at work first
it's based on godbikki from axz
sort of
> Is that the weapons scattered around? Defeated by shemmiku and- hmm... Corrupted!bikki?
yeah

<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
and Rebecca has a 11/10 henshin
but yeah i love dog days and i also hate how tsuzuki has forgotten about it
and just called me Millh様 instead of Millhi様
i changed it to this after an artist i was talking too made an error and forgot the i
well there was
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
its my fav girl cosplaying as my fav girl (and my namesake)
but also
but yeah tsuzuki could bullshit its an au in nanohaverse and it wouldnt evern be wrong
half of the gear cast is in it anyway
and horie does the eds
they all are
and its dumb fun
and it actually suffers from the same problem
its a show written by tsuzuki, who also wrote nanoha
~~thats the point~~
yes
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
nanoha but not nanoha
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>

yeah that works
the link gave a 403 forbidden
403 forbidden
bless that person
someone commed that eh
she's not the real au kiri
yes
it boils down to au kiri was in a coma from qn explosion, jii made an android and ver implemented a kiri AI. At the end of the event android kiri sacrificed herself to power up a relic that healed and awakened au kiri.
well
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
technically carol is also an au
they would have showed in the opening for lost song if they had one
yeah but neither kanade or miku are part of the different versions
well kanade already is an au and au miku is yeeted <:15min:655058014495047690>
maybe if we get a separate one again starring that au
she's not playable though only android kirika is
the real one is the long haired
https://twitter.com/zero_0w0/status/1350294753955364868
the wrong green
was gonna update it properly sometime in January
soon
she's not that involved in LS but eh that's only a small part of the xdu world
Kanade has been important to xdu world shenigans
it could be ye
the best part is the ninja ogawa in the molcar
i can read it
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
did you think of shank shank?
it's pow so its 119
not forgotten just not required <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
yup
heh
good shit cocoa
would watch
<:RadioHeartEyes:754159110408241292>
it's maria
its zombieland saga
looks liek that typical, the one who set up the camera joins in just in time for the auto shot goes off
he's pretty dedicated about it commissioning art for it
yes rady
real power to that shirabe x miku guy
you know
that's kanade on every mem with x girl
pfff
hibimiku and chrismiku somewhat
there's only 2 possible
I'm a bonk you
eh sec
i really love the design
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
at least its a good design
~~they tried with dollhouse but then it was still ssj~~
that also
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
at least xdu remembered it lmao
~~granted the show also forgets about miku and chris shenigans way until s5~~
sometimes i want to ask how he got to that one in particular as they never even traded a single word
~~sucks that the editorial has 0 influence in decisions~~
let's go together heart
<:Asahichair:623960557183041563>
going to the hospital
that explains it
~~nope~~
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
when in doubt, just comm more
time to break it brb
why not
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
make it prettier
~~then no spoilers for you~~
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>

it's pretty good

the assistent of neiru
yeah
<:LUL:545650745534447631>

bit like sara
oh hanabi, someone drew diamond with a design you might like
as getting into hololive is essentially a free way to get famous
seeing as covercorps requires you to already have done streaming before, i'm pretty sure there's some that apply as a vtuber for hololive just for the money
i mean idk
there's probably some

its why i prefer dms when possible cs artists gives you a lot more leeway
yeah same on skeb
<:ashrug:558439555599040552>
i guess they can buy something on amazon then straight away
everytime i ask an artist what i should pay with they go like amazon gift code
jp likes to use it
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
if in dms its either paypal or just use amazon gift code
me neither really
that's technically against pixiv request stos
lucky
prolly also an option for you but it requires twitter for an account
skeb uses credit cards

def new antags

fnacy version instead of codeblocks from yt

Flashback
Bcs final Season and more crap alchemist doesn't sound like a finale
They're gonna be first 6 eps fodder trash
Normal anime airs at like 1 am till 3 am
And kids shozs
Aka shounen
There's only a handful anime that airs in day time slot
Anime is late night spear
<:BikkiSad:497709420122341386>
not including miku
~~evaporated~~
where's maria <:15min:495770478678638593>
the real question is
cant be easier to find
well its in announcements
bikki looks dumb founded and chris is shouting
now that im home i can finally watch the pv so i will
SG perhaps
most likely this is all going ot be ep 1 bcs its geah
pv is usually things from first 3 eps
<:15min:495770478678638593>
has bikki down
well whoever uses the red beam in the pv
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
gx remake movie cutting out topdad when
i hope he doesnt appear again
and its also super long
when you're banking hard on multiverse bringing all events together, cant do that in a 10min show
that would be a movie
there is xd main quests
if they would do it
well
they're likely to adapt xdu event into ovas perhaps
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yes but not the end of geah, KR will whip something up
and needs more miku piano yea
oh nice spear
so  i would probably give jp a try  if i ever rewatch
well i saw beyblade in dutch
let it all out
let it riiiiip
well one is vampire, one is a werewolf and one is frankenstein
yeah i cant see music based spinoffs at all
why not just make an fine origin <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
going back that far kaliks?
shit like the illuminati destroying europe and all
but theres still enough content for spin-offs
yeah
~~if anything geah has learned me not to hype it too much, it will let you down~~
G is the fav for most from what i gather
and he was one of the problems
axz is meant to fix gx problems
but the question is who will it be xD
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they have mao who started her career as an idol
kana plays in an idolshow for kids
and well aimi is aimi
whats the chance they're going to give the new trio a song
actually talking bout music
<:15min:495770478678638593>
~~so idols~~
<:15min:495770478678638593>
We just know they wanted everything to be a last season besides axz, but like we don't know the behind the scenes decisions they made for this to happen and we never will, besides including some sequelbait just incase isn't inherently a bad thing.
It isn't an indication they were all gonna follow up
He just rehashed ideas from his notebook
It originally being standalone doesn't matter
that was to open the gates
they didnt
i swear mind flay is just going to be that beam being used with her eyes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
well maria is the only one missing in that beam screenshot
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
too dumb to get mind flayed
ye
but bad quality rip
yes
nein
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
end of symphogear
last 2 eps will also have a directors cut version
all they really do is use the philo stone and use carols research for the faust robes
its like 60% right probably
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
i should do the same but first i need to post a
nope
no
no
we tld everything thats available bar a few lines iirc
could be
coupling song is just a weird word choice, zoid means the b side song
pretty sure aoi is referring to bikki
soundcloud maybe
just don't upload to yt
why not
the commercial with the miku and bikki handholding
theoretically it should be possible with the sakurai theory being public
they used only a piece ye
<:15min:495770478678638593>
it's written by agematsu so its gonna be deep
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
so wont really be surprised if they use this b-side
in the timeframe xv takes place
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and we happen to have 2 birthdays in winter
and kirika b-side is named happy birthday song
well bikki b-side did appear in the anime
https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1141994323342327808
except in axz she couldn't, needed SG<:15min:495770478678638593>
everything is public iirc
kirika xb bside is a birthday song
and cheaper time slots at night <:15min:495770478678638593>
and like max said, DVR is still huge in Japan + streaming is also a thing nowadays so they can watch whenever
there's only a few day series
anime is almost always latenight
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
or 26.00 whatever hour it was but Japan counts after 24
so 7 july 1 am
6 july 25.00
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i just realized we could have been getting ep 11 tomorrow if xv wasnt delayed
better channel
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1143573367854948352
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
Papillon
busou renkin has best guy ever in anime
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
we have miku bday in november and Chris in december so if the song gets used in the anime it's likely to be for Chris
https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1144532373326819328?s=19
it should be around the same for the rest
yes
they got the license late for gx
so subs around 1h later at 18.00 if its regular simulcast release
for me irc jp timezone xv airs in will be at 17.00
cs timezones
saturday still
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
preview pics
https://twitter.com/SYMPHOGEAR/status/1147098325008523264?s=19
it's time
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
preview pics today
Friday today and day before the Broadcast so
<:15min:495770478678638593>
they haven't updated it
yes
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
bs11 airs at the same time but nothing at 24.30
and before that it's lord melloi and demon slayer
Tokyo mx at 24.30
「センコロールコネクト」公開記念特番
there's none
so likely
the lapis fused with the pendants
<:15min:495770478678638593>
there's at least 4 or 5 this ep
||chris uses sniper successfully||
can just watch a stream for tokyomx
songs are subbed besides the last one
and ||it also looks like he loved her back||
<@!400844698140409856> || its god yes and yes it seems to eb the guy fine loved||
^
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
meanwhile skiddiks: using heavenrend was a mistake, but gotta stick with it after 4 seasons
lmao
so is YTT but yeah
<:15min:495770478678638593>
people who do geah are still alive
commie is subbing it
new versions are bloated and whatnot
<:15min:495770478678638593>
on utorrent you're supposed to use 2.2.1 or so
the new one
and theyre shit AK
||FINAL COMMANDER|| is the name
they dint play op/ed eyt
actually just insert
that bad
we've been talking about it and its really hard to just even edit it
its all over the place
<@139432096023183360>
||shit like > catching a cold when its actually freezing to death||
theyre not good
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
its easier to read for me then it is to listen
its different imo
technical jargon and all that
that also
even if you know jp its still easier to read it in your native language tbh
esp for geah
<:smug:239129154061205505>
would make it easier on tls
right joe
wish we would have a script
at least they get a script
<:15min:495770478678638593>
that or commeme
we dont
it mostly depends on bushi anyway
unless kadvin or whatever the fuck was suddenly relocated from space to earth
the first one was in earth tho
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i wouldnt say this here joe
we're past christmas
so that they could give them enough time
they did the sequences 6 months ago before anything else
who loves X girl
bcs each one is done by a different animator
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
well with just phonic gain she blocked a beam with a punch in ep 1
up until the end
at least everything went according to her plan
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
get someone who actually knows alchemy
think about the possibilities
we could have had sg
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
yeah in reference to the axz ver magic
god bless sugita
https://twitter.com/sugitaLOV/status/1147548194059911168
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
no christmas carol
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
while im scrolling back for the pics obligatory ||https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/231447613122150401/597133521340989500/Part_5.png?width=1224&height=689||
its was esp doing the same pose
not like that
no
phonic gain increase
elfnein - fine also callback
the chris sentence
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they didnt animate the walking but at least theyre on model
and even then, its actually not that bad
<:15min:495770478678638593>
mahou retry does it also on ep 1 but worse
that still decent enough
lmao saki
sometimes simple is the best
like i always say
no
it's in the credits
enki sumerian God of water ye
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
poor enki refered to as mysterieus custodian
<:15min:495770478678638593>
Can't contain it just in 1 channel?
just ask bingo to add it to the bot
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
the edgebikki one is worse
its the pose

found it
<:15min:495770478678638593>
geah ed full is also out
Nana fans are crazy
yeah
sugita and kaneko are meming on twitter instead
dont worry
rinse and repeat
> new villain stronger the nthe old
> heroes get power up
every action show pretty much does that though
he was also in eh that old guy android thing
<:reeee:309960719623782411>
basamaria is a crackship
Chrysler said it was good enough so here.
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
if only it was that easy
what if theres a different operation version
gears now say normal operation
zoid made a good point yesterday
they will find something new
they used it as a bypass yes
which they used for ignite
there's no more dainsleif
yes
lmao nice
<https://togetter.com/li/588161> <https://ascii.jp/elem/000/001/005/1005155/index-2.html> <https://twitter.com/takama2_shinji/status/585424044868018179>

before someone says im doing the same <:15min:495770478678638593>
the problem is that almost nobody ever cites fucking sources and just spew made up crap
budget fluctuates with the show anyway, theres always exceptions
highets grossing movie is only a few billion yen for late night anime
then again
sounds doable if it was a big hitter
2h movie?
they have way better rates and budget
maybe it was for a movie?
average is 1-2 million dollar for 13 ep show
per ep
in 2010 it was average 145k dollar
no>
and wit hthat they need to pay everything
its 1 budget for the whole show
they dont get a budget per episode anyway
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
if only animators actually got paid
i wish
animation costs money
cure cosmo is also pretty fucking good
meh
she doesnt need it
<:15min:495770478678638593>
she's gonna be involved for sure but good god no gear pls
for gods love dont give miku a new gear
<:15min:495770478678638593>
it depends on the meme for me
wild arms takes things from gaogao and the likes
which is what gear takes after the most tbh
i guess you cna also count GaoGaiGar and sequels
saint seiya forever forgotten
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but the transformations were done before they decided to delay
for the next 3 months
yeah would be nice
i need to learn how to paste discord things
found it
https://puu.sh/DPMdY.png
only staff did
the committee never changed
we always had them tho
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bushi is in every geah committee though
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
going by the missions in xdu
next ep probably has maria
so if adam wanted to kill it, then the 3 stooges want to revive it
while the 3 stooges said they had a different plan than adam
well yeah they mentioned adam wanted to destroy the coffin and likely the guy inside
everyone watched bayformers even if they are bad so its the easiest one to call out
or awaken it at the least
alchs are gonna steal it
we all know whats gonna happen next ep tho
<:15min:495770478678638593>
now its just 5 primes betrayed 1 prime
in revenge of the fallen were 1 prime betrayed the others
except in the reverse
bay transformers <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
you know what that reminds me of
be in the show or keywords
we'll find out soon enough
<:15min:495770478678638593>
seeing the coffin
well some at least died
enki is a custodian tho
eeh
yea i assume it was war related and enki goofed up and had to activate it to save humanity
tfw curse wasnt actually supposed to be activated <:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
they both were in love with eachother
if it was enkis arm there was no way fine wouldnt have known
the shuttle is already burning so its already in earths atmosphere
thats what i assume, hence they can sing in gx
space > moonm and space > low atmosphere
bcs they werent in space space
too bad we got cucked by some rando's
~~jsut buy a ryzen~~
thats bcs tvs dont really support the .ass format
mobile?
its a curse
yes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://puu.sh/DPX36.png
<:15min:495770478678638593>
in babylonian mythology
<:15min:495770478678638593>
is also called ea
enki on the other hand
iirc he's called enki's creation but it was aruru who made enkidu
<:15min:495770478678638593>
both of them lead to the epic of gilgamesh however
yes
reading this page about enki/enlil and all i can think of is no fate stop, stop, stooooop
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
the best part theoretically is that the director can give kaneko a big fuck you and do what he wants
and whoever else they employed to actually do the episode scripts
both of them rreally but mostly kaneko
yeah
https://puu.sh/DPUN0.png
pretty far stretched like he mentions though
oh zoid has a nice theory
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
sounds plausible
they disagreed with eachother on what to do with earth in sumerian texts
what ifd the mummy is his brother
so if enki is the guy at the start
yes in the credits
ok
which ones
joe already fixed them but waiting on eh song before v2
yeah we know of them
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
bikki how did you do that
with the song in my heart
oh....
but yeah the suit should be able to do that
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
well max i do think elfnein is incapable
yeah
yeah
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
thanks geah
suits > science
the suits keep them safe
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and the stooges will also trio
<:15min:495770478678638593>
or maria
bikki gonna duet wih catgirl
im not gonna look too much into science in gear tbh
yea had to wait for china
rips should be soon™
there's a dedicated jp blog for it
it usually involved maths to get the magic number<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
bcs everything is mastered at a different resolution and and the median is 872 or so
it's mostly a case per case thing
like this is true for XV but another show will have a different master so might be only worth it in 720p.
encode shenigans<:15min:495770478678638593>
but upscaling to 1080p is better then downscaling it to 720p
XV is mastered in 872p so closest is 900p which is a stupid thing to use but it happens
1080p ka
all she did was touch karmanoise so actual bikki started suffering
<:15min:495770478678638593>
edgebikki didn't ruin world piece tho
they should animate the one where everyone is dead <:Ver:336656981144109066>
watch out with what you say
we had 1 ep and they already had more screentime then in AXZ
idk max
same
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
FC was an insert
you're not the only one <:harold:364119409620418591>
you should be immune by now
they didn't play op/ed in ep1
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1149615687419060224
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/231447613122150401/599169061531680778/D_Q3P0-U8AIxM_I.png
<:harold:364119409620418591>
wait
AXZ had it also
yeah they always do that
xcept for gear that is
sales always drop between sequels
it's a surprise sales didn't even drop
and every cd
well technically you could include a code on every volume
last 4 volumes still sell more then previous season
it Evens out
only first 2 volumes big
^
but the rest of my thinking ones are usually legit, thinking bout this
or <:thonkang:363820225067614218>
yeah when i use <:thonking:284704644540792832> it's usually like that for me
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
they removed the locks part in XV keyword for the gears btw
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
Basically confirms no1 else is able to make geahs<:15min:495770478678638593>
the most interesting one is the fine keyword
depends on how long it would be, 1-2 ep ova sounds doable enough for a prequel
I'm actually hoping they announce gx boxset during XV
xdu album 2 and gx boxset
if they dont announce it before
<:merchant:559882790837944320>
perhaps a bit of both
pick one but those 2 dont fit together in one line
>kaneko
>easy
<:15min:241820657027907584>
let alone kaneko speech
i would help but me no editor or proficient in the english language
<:15min:495770478678638593>
you should be working, not writing down crackpot theories
so if enki didnt activate the curse, everyone would have still been talking the 1 same language
enki didnt want to activate it but had no choice bcs something fucked up happened we dont know about
as evidenced by first minute of xv
fine was doing all her stuff based on a misunderstanding tho
maybe the others didnt but enki did
at least enki did
the thing is they did want to live on earth peacefully
they at least do look human <:15min:495770478678638593>
and died on earth
they made humanity
bcs eh
its why its an unofficial preview
https://twitter.com/kirihodashi/status/1149596637892759552
you should psot the meme edit
find out in like  ~3hs
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
only like 10000 people
> did people die
the torture was to remove nephus parts from chris
ommitted in the anime though
and fine bsdm stuff in s1 actually had a reason
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
we finally got a year geah takes place in
also
everything else is fine surrounding it
that it was
and i believe she did it on jii to scare her, not actually fucking hit her with it
how hard is it to understand that bcs she used it on jii she is scarred and doesn't want to use it anymore
before bikki hsc2a it
after ver linkers them
when jii and kiri drops down she literally mentions her scythe skill to kill souls
before she took away the linker powerup
i believe she tried using it against bikki
she almost killed jii
and maybe kiri was actually scarred bcs she hurt the girl she likes....
the relic origin...
stupid sure though
it was perfectly in character
scythe was described to kill souls not noise
they would have to asspull retcon her which would be worse
fine isnt going to come back
serena also
every character is in the op
and its not actually that badly drawn
rest of the ep makes up for it
not important scenes so not like they matter
badly drawn
vamp did scumback scheme
cat got owned easily
and they arent a big deal though
and geah has a bad track record actually fixing stuff
they're not important
it wont for those scenes
and yeah the gas masks in the OP are ukraine
ye
else you need to wait a week
if you torrent it yes
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:GenjurouThumbsUp:267393750349643776>
if mp3 https://nyaa.si/view/1157638
flac or mp3?
<:harold:364119409620418591>
im surviving noise till then <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:hyp:250363576005558272>
23 years till we can die at zwei wing cocnert
also gear takes place in ~2042-2045
everything
at most fine will appear in a flashback
imagine actually giving 2 more lines to sawashiro explaining that
I'm sure fine is a torture lover but that part with chris was to make sure she didn't become a fusion
I'm just explaining that part...
fine didn't want a second relic fusion
the torture with electricity was to remove the shards
fine didn't want that
the shards were in chris body
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
so it looks weird
like i said, the anime ommitted that part
the shards
the full relic chris uses before fine dons it
nephustian
the henshin scenes they upload on yt dont have the dimming
its already fixed actually
eh
max
like the adam arm still made it into the bds
well geah doesnt actually fix what needs fixing
something something animation director usually corrects most scenes to look the same for the most part
they're probably uncorrected scenes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the scarf is also a double fist
and suda-1 is chernobyl
bcs the Op also shows suda-1
tbh the gasmasks are probably referencing good old maria and serena birthplace
everyone was escorted to safety
in G nobody actually died
🤣
the biggest jii hater even called jii cool
her transfo gonna be <:yummy:235243310086750208>
jii's is lewder usually though tbh
except its bitrate starved to hell and you need to be behind a vpn
but yeah the hibiki XV transformation on the gear youtube doesnt have any dimming
too bad they dont make a different master for them and use the tv one
they can bypass the laws on streaming
yeah
yep
at least 6 eps done
bcs of the extra 3 months delay
i would actually hope they have eh
LOL
so if they keep that trend for XV
jii's at leas tAXZ was much more lewd then kiri's
eh
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
same
they shaved off another 10secs bcs it was too long for broadcast
had to be redone
> kiri transfo was too lewd
https://twitter.com/ohkuboyoshiyuki/status/1150086476706664448
also dropping this here
durga and the gasmasks yeah
if they have like only 2 eps done and still need to finish ep 3 thats pretty bad
her scarf is in the pose of a scorpion doing a sting attack
its the pose and such
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
after you said that 30mins ago yes
it just isnt going to do anything
it could happen
after this ep im not going to make predictions
that looks like lahm yea
so it sucks
thasts not testament
where she did pew pew
in ep 1
they alread yshowed she can transform the scarf
layered as a scorpion tail
its the scarf
i dont htink you should take it as a literal scorpion
the way the arm looks is actually scorp stinger based
nah
<:15min:241820657027907584>
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
oh
thats eh pretty farstretched tbh
> reading old news papers
the newspaper of miku's dad
yes in s1
you can see 2012 in the newspaper
which also means they retconned the years<:15min:495770478678638593>
so 3 months till kiri bday
2045
the live of this ep was january
<@216181207874928640> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/558551287344660490/599681348092952696/1563045462510.png?width=1235&height=695
live was january
kiri is in april
yeah 3 months
ogawa was still in when it collapsed
see kiri in axz
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
i think he's just cuckoo
for xv
ep 1 is 2044 ep 2 is 2045
xv is 2044-2045
cypher lost it
basa isnt gonna see the bracelet
america has it
finding the bracelet is useless
but im not sure about that specific one
there is some new ost yes
it will happen later
nothing is happening now
its clearly a time bomb
nah
yes?
but all you get is  13 <:15min:241820657027907584>
would be such a shame to not let it see the daylight
i hope they add the original kiri henshin version on the BD
thats not bikki rebuild gear
but yeah different form alltogether
its not as bad when in movement
its decent
and different gauntlets
she doesnt have the leg armor
different legs
https://puu.sh/DSpOi.png legs
https://puu.sh/DSpPt.png
and so are the arms
the leg gears are different
the biki in the OP looks off
nah its new design
that case has all of her tails yea
thats an apple reference
fudou needs to steal it first <:15min:495770478678638593>
i liked the sneaky tongue she did there
ye that
assuming they are even putting it on BD
i posted the tweet a bit ago
yep
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but that doesnt explain completely different armguards
yeah i thought about that also melua
god pls voy
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yes nougat i wouldnt be surprised
just part of a new bikki design
so actually yeah the arms might not be her scarf
<a:DESSDESSDEEEEESS:393794107484536834>
https://puu.sh/DSq3S.png
she mentions she's gonna keep the burden of xxxxx people she killed with her
SG looked like she didnt actually want to kill all of the civilians but had too to power the things
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
🤔
cyborg losing weight
bcs it is <@!307159888969072640>
https://puu.sh/DSqpa.jpg
wolf yes
or frankengirl <:15min:495770478678638593>
werewolf, vampire and frankenstein
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
he always was
in GX he actually does something
G was whatever
it was unneeded in AXZ
you can't blame ver for that tho
well yes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
if you mean the independence day thing
yeah i also got it
<:15min:495770478678638593>
surely people escaped before they blocked the exits imo
it just really looks like uncorrected animation
but like melua says it just looks better
i keep seeing people it the sol parts look off artwise
nah they didnt
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
if this was hold in america every civilian would have shot the noise
they should just have some armed guys there
yeah they seem to be setting something up for elfnein with the helmet
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
obv nobody expected noise to show up at a gear concert
yeah solo
actually using copters at the start would have made the most sense
by the time she got the rockets the shit would have went down already
chris needs setup time for the rockets
and eh
that also
well yes but they didnt
shirabe
granted bikki already has been on international tv
that would reveal them as gear users
nah they wouldnt have used chris or bikki
they send the helicopter later
same
<:15min:495770478678638593>
you dont understand how terrible traffic at live concerts is
man arc
i still think he's gonna have saved those 2 and be out
<:BERSERKBU:281803418136346624>
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/D_YtqYNWsAE4SAq.png:large
Stop clinging to ogawa
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the last thing are what they are using as a base now
sigh
powered by not phonic gain
they're in permanent last ignition
they aren't
they arent weaker?
the suffering is likely a cause of a not used to new body and almost no memories left
she always had that
the burning of the memories?
key
and had a plan
<:15min:495770478678638593>
carol was the only villain that actually acted smart at times
same but not in geah world
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
^
after
helis yes which they did
chris options arent an option
<:okay:330354891727962122>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
if i open an archive from 2001 it doesnt mean we're in 2001
its not current
its a record
it is an archive
nah
on the archives? yes
and the nephilim archives in G mention 2012
they do mentione dates but like 20xx
you're overthinking
soon™
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
so like a normal company?
ogawa has been cleaning them up since end of axz for the most part
<:15min:495770478678638593>
time to rewatch solo
and the removed mention of the lock system on the gear keyword
besides the fine one
there arent that much interesting keywords for ep 1
just post it here
to get their goals
hence they arent afraid of doing backstabbing things
they mention in the ep they are weaker anyway
honestly its the and maria that cracks me up everytime i see the reaction image
rofl
<:panic:282277202995970048>
i spitted out my drink
lmao
>I call bullshit she's the biggest addict <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yep
igalima
destroyer of souls
what if  she hits jii again <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
i mean its bullshit power and kiri probably doesnt want to use it again
kiri not using it still sounds perfectly normal to me in later seasons
likewise arc
<:15min:495770478678638593>
see dotv
a mistranslation
<a:15min:490152513623031809>
if you want a YT spoiler leak go to dotv solo
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
maybe in a shinai
same arc
<:eeh:242112096584728576>
no
👏
unless elfnein wearing the mindhelmet is just big bait
carol seems to play some part at the very least
so long till song release
so every friday
they update the keywords when the previews for the next ep go live
kiri cd is wednesday
ep 2 keywords will only appear next week friday
its like how you get funky scenes when pausing live action
the problem with screenshots like that is that they are meant to be in motion not in a still
they dont
aimi: did you like the jam? <:aimichamp:374859189669068800>
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
it sure is different then her every day roles she normally does
they ran out of jam to put on toast and there wasn't a store nearby
i hope with the 2 persons who clinged on him
batgirl does have pretty good legs
i dont really think he will
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
vampires
Bat
millaarc is a vampirte based alch
it was a good unintentional pun
you should have kept it in
or any big fandom
you could replace mha with any shounen fandom chossei <a:15min:490152508757508106>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
but geah and mha in a whole?
i can somewhat understand the comparison between deku and bikki
my hero academia
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
dub it like thye dub idol shows
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
people watching legally wont be abel to start XV till ep 7 or so
i dont htink he can shadow weave a all the nosie tho
so he could escape
he was close to the exit before the noise dusted those
he was also surrounded by noise
hence they pumped more linker in her then what was supposed to be use
her output was too low
and kanade couldnt actually wield gungnir
ofc thats what kanade used
heck linker surpresses the Zesshou effects
kanade was already a walking dead and was drugged on bad linker
it doesn't kill users
yes we did chossei
Zesshou was never intended to kill users
but they never failed<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
ironocally the teleport crystals have a chance to fail
ye and she can fly away
bikki does
basa doesnt know the girl
and if it was the same girl it would have been more effective if it was bikki not basa
the ye color and hair color are intentionaly the same looking but different person
its a different person
you dont grow up that much in 1.5y-2ys
and iots not the same girl grown up
https://twitter.com/nene_hieda/status/1150346232432218112
nene hieda*
nene hiedeki something did her
yea bcs of that staff note
yoegoslavia?
i dont remember what it was before that
ukraine since last year
alternate universe ssj > give to miku can go to into ssj
that setup is exactly what they did  for miku in xdu
<:15min:495770478678638593>
thats xdu andmeuths
on linker
yeah if she borrows she could
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bikki stole it
only lahm
maria cant use gungnir anymore
yeah would be nice if they didnt need it anymore
and considering after AXZ
so it should be possible to outgrow the linker when they get enough native sync rate
through the battles and such
but her basic sync rate has raised
sdhe is
Maria is proof enough
you should be able too
they also pumped out the linker after she overdosed
is that the FIS trio would be done with linker
but honestly what i would have liked to see the most
and then we got the upgraded ver linker
at one point
and bikki cleansed them of the linker
different linker
+ sheer fucking will
miku waved a future flag on ep 1 yea
ep 3 is the mami ep
if you mean madoka solo then no
<:15min:495770478678638593>
before that its madoka ep 3
ep4 is supposed to be the bikki episode according to aoi
the best one is going to be XV ep 4
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
anohana after
madoka before
yes
bluray discs
first draft: very unlikely
second draft: likely
and if the next question is going to be will it be on bds
<:15min:495770478678638593>
or auto reply
someone should add it to a bot when someone posts the tweet
first draft rejected because it was too lewd
second draft wasnt finished on time so they had to cut 10seconds for broadcast
they do have archives of 2012 at least <:15min:495770478678638593>
yea
<:15min:495770478678638593>
like we have trump and abe in 2045 as presidents
its just gonna be take x event but change the year
its gonna be based on chernobyl
yeah interview
current op just looks like a bait and switch <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
that was his last line on his tweet
yea hero
i dont know how you can say its axz form when its clearly not
same melua
chris always has good punch bikki scenes
its clearly a yet another gungnir form
no neck armor
no legs armor, different armguards
its not
and is a new gungnir form all together
yea except the fists arent bikki scarf
millaarrd is the vampire
worthy trade-off
<:15min:495770478678638593>
all she needs to do is insert a buttplug
instead of having a henshin
yeah
melua pls
<:15min:495770478678638593>
wolf
and big
jii made yoyo's cool again
its really just gonna be something with that scorpion
too much white <:15min:495770478678638593>
<https://puu.sh/DSIWg.jpg>
golden bikki is no suit all gold
she has too much of a suit in the XV version
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://streamable.com/meizx
or GX whenever she did it
<:panic:282277202995970048>
but the jii attack is new to XV and they named it after G
they also wrongly translated a whole line
dont forget that if you use CR they misnamed the jii attack
millaarc is  interesting in that she uses her wings to augment her combat effiency
vanessa is the frankenstein monster
elsa is the werewolf
but you can see it easily spot it
that one actually does feel fluid at least
same for the your name rotoscoping
you really can't with gear attacks
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
unless you are ufotable and want to rotoscope sword fights
bcs they generally dont rotoscope fights
if you know what mind flay does you know her ability
<:RadioShady:585598642094735551>
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
well KR sues people that upload their stuff
yt is too compressed
just wait for the cd
<:15min:495770478678638593>
it's easy to spot for the trained eye
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
her seal is a literal mind flay
that's not how mind flay works
no
composite is still bad at times but that's not going to be fixed anyway<:SerenaOhoho:586715673477251080>
geah is praised for action/henshin in the animation circlejerk in the industry so ye
<:chad:546915825974771714>
ye that's miku in the ed meta
that wouldn't be fun
that's current xdu event plot
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
at least its not mind control
yeah different animator for each henshin
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
and ye i love her legs
ye
mind flay =/= mind control
she can't
but i have work in 4hs so i should probably sleep😂
and the lock system being removed from the gear keyword could mean they have it fully unlocked <:15min:495770478678638593>
it was a perfectly viable option for America for example to be able to crack the code for gears
has been since s1
the theory is public cypher
fine <:merchant:559882790837944320>
it also reveals that nobody managed to make a gear yet
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
it's 4 seasons overdue though
yeah
how comes they're named like sr03- gungnir etc
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they only revealed just now after 5 seasons the geah fine thing
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
or put it in a keyword
gear either never mentions it or it's in a throw away line
which makes sense but they could of have said a line about it probably
twice
yep
it's either commie or cr
forcing yourself to watch something is bad
<:RadioThisIsFine:585896705040580624>
well it was stupid talk
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
all these wrong opinions
Adam is good voice
just his voice
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
all i want is hear more sexy Adam whispers
~~fuduo just wants the best for basa~~
that would actually ruin their sacrifice in axz
no
its scrapped
it doesnt exist
thats serena/maria yea
the basa thing aside, the other 2 conceptual thigns we know of werent sudden
the dead should stay dead and that includes old gear <:15min:585535362626093082>
elfnein was using the helmet on herself though
`well mummy was <:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah
same
it showcases her legs <:15min:495770478678638593>
yea
unlike other "villains"
people like her because she actually did something

YT release
that said
<:15min:495770478678638593>
24hs before ep airs
previews always go up at friday
solo
what
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
it wasnt
no that thing also got destroyed in the ssj beam
they put xv logo on the yt stream when they were airing all the seasons
yes
its from the youtube stream
its only bcs of bikki using durandal that both that and nephustan got destroyed
if it was just durandal vs nephus, fine wouldnt have died
thats just bcs > bikki
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
it looks underwhelming but the only reason durandal was destroyed is bcs of nephustan
yeha ban is a good example
just no lasers
remove durandal and you would have still had the dragon fully powered
durandal was just for the lasers
the dragon is from nephus regen and solomons cane
it wasnt used for the dragon
durandal wasnt used for the dragon in s1 btw <:15min:495770478678638593>
is it this hard to look up keywords and see what they say about nephus/durandal and whatever 🤔
so wouldnt be able to regen after
when the dragon was destroyed so was nephustan
you would jsut be a walking lightshow
yeah durandal hitting and nephus regening all of it
and zoid is now legally tling anime so they are never gonna get done
but zoid tlcd the BDs for commie
yeah
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
according to our tl
"Millaarc Cranstoun"
<:harold:364119409620418591>
yes based on that one book
styria to be precise
millaarc is austria
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

big yoyo even
<:15min:495770478678638593>
shirabe yoyo henshin confirmed
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
pog
Chris has revolvers
they literally canned the whole show atm
they outright cancelled fire force ep 3 today and future eps are when they decide
> nothing delayed

 gear wont bcs it doesnt have anything to do with fire
the only thing that's changed in s5 is that they have a new series director
every season has had ono as director besides s1
really
shirabe
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
strictly speaking Ono has more power then kaneko and agematsu over gear
<:15min:495770478678638593>
might be on zoids blog
there was a whole interview about kaneko and agematsu
he isnt involved in writing geah
agematsu just composes the songs
one of the few they never switched out
well its the guy who has always been in charge of action animation and later on action direction ever since s1
probably not considering they're switching focus
there's also the wikia one which name shall not be sproken
well yeah but one is invite only, the other one is also public in dotv
yes
not in here at least from first glance but in the other discords? yeah
literally everyone called that though
the thing before the end?
^
<:15min:495770478678638593>
im glad its gone yes
god bless she finally used it
yes
thats grenadier
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
have you never seen grenadier?
https://twitter.com/KABABABABA/status/1152617858821525504

kabababa confirmed jii henshin
ye
the place where they build the Atomic bomb
it's not a51 but los something
that got referenced again anyway
pretty sure he spoke?
<:15min:495770478678638593>
also topdad
ye
the ep said it at the start
over 70k confirmed deaths in the concert
also
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
fudou
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yea
albeit pretty telegraphed
the end is a pretty holy shit
yeah fucking finally
and they dont have to reinvent the wheel either
dont fix what is not broken
what the actual fuck
its complete
its the batmobile instead
keywords said it deliberately that only fine can make them so the pendant technology is lost
yeah no more gears
all according to fudou's plan
the geahs will deal with them before that even happens
jii is the longest yeah
the higher the amount of animators the more chance something can go wrong
granted XV started with 18 on ep 1 <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
maybe 12 towards the end of a season when everything gets stupid
healthy schedules are like 5-6
big
yes
ep 3 had 22 key animators which is dangerous territory
as long as they dont burn out yeah
and so is the ssj relic
AXZ just made it slighty easier t osee
its been telegraphed pretty hard ever since fudou appeared
he sacrified 70k people for it
with him as the ruler ofc
he wants power to make japan great again
<:15min:495770478678638593>
a custodian
bracelet of shem-ha
apparently yeah
the bracelet?
its the ep she is hyping
not sad
you forgot the eye
<:smug:239129154061205505>
both her and basa still fell down when the concert stage crashed down
> she didnt take any hits
the basa shot was cuter <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
also needs to be said
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1152646909942611968
so hopefully
they wouldnt change
they also forgot to animate one of the segway noises swords <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
doubt they'll fix that vanessa error also
too minor
the date? nah
<:Pogchamp:373682786856337419>
when axz is already released
> fix in bds
doubt they really thought about years anyway
thats 2044 ye
archives can be from the past
the archives said 2012
irt wasnt
they didnt fix adam's arm either
nah they wont
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
it does make sense to me
i still dont get how it doesnt make sense
```Nephilim is a complete relic that was stolen from the US research institute that Vice Minister Shibata mentioned in episode 2. 6 years ago there was an incident where it was successfully activated, but went out of control. It was then sealed in that pupa-like state. (Presumably this was the scene depicted at the beginning of episode 1 of G.) The reason why Nastassja and co. were in place at the Queens of Music concert was to try and activate Nephilim with the phonic gain produced by the concert, a precedent set by Fine in season 1.```
FIS stole it
not ver
the US had the nephilim
im pretty sure he knows
bikki > jii > kiri > chris
he was ahin
i dont think we will get basa next ep tbh
<:smug:239129154061205505>
the boob hills
it sure did jii justice
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
so they can get forgotten till the final
~~beast operation~~
yeah
he thought himself is perfect mostly
i have my blood card on me xd
<:15min:495770478678638593>
O Rh D postive C+ c+ E- e+
slow on the uptake lmao
<:StrawberryJam:342564989556490240>
its like eating a sandwich with 5cms of jam
yeah
i like blood+ but i can see that take
the movie is alright but the main series ruins the entry for the most part
but blood-c is actually pure trash <:15min:495770478678638593>
parallel worlds for the most part
they're related and yet arent?
dont bother
it just looks like trash bcs of no bitrate
it doesnt have dimming so
when they ypload the henshin scene
and vpn to watch it on youtube
just wait till next week then
now if only that would work for fata gacha <:ADAM:338363978797547539>
in axz and 3.5 xdu
that's essentially what gear did
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
now akin it's more like my bullshit works because people thought it works like that<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
🤔
but it did gave us the gay speech
the bikki God was the worst thing of axz
and most of them were poor tbh
do you want nyaa or mega?
instead of editing cr
original translation
we started doing OTL so shit should come out sooner for us now
but they are attracted to light because insects gather there
well bats hate artificial light
<:kappa:281531248634232842>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
something something moths attracted to light
she probably goes to the spotlight whereever she goes
from looking at ep 2
or the noise that nana drew
like the bushi noise
wouldn't be surprised if its a joke noise
tl wise they're fine but the editing is oh so horrible
well thats better but its still > cr subs
the worst part is that overlayed audio tune
rip
i only know he used nordvpn
i have no idea
🤔
my friend is in china and has no problems torrenting anime
but do you really watch geah like this meta?
oh god its the CR version

yes kanade
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
but if she does it will be yui horie as usual
we dont even know if serena will appear lol
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
stop krika
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
unless they actually manage to make a speech thats even gayer
i dont think they can get gayer then the AXZ speech anyway
it's gonna be a nanoha thing
they won't
for crackship worshippers <:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah you are only gonna get teases, no confirmation
it was just friendship
ofc not
was pretty hard forgotten in later seasons though
s1 had chris and miku friendship going on
<:reeee:309960719623782411>
mariabasa is a crackship

only a little bit extreme crazy theory
its a bit eh

the kiri missing henshin key frames

<:LUL:243896110001684480>
pls
They're on the Cat site
yeh
we just didn't let anyone know or posted it till that chinese youtube acc mixed half of them into 1 video
<:15min:495770478678638593>
nah like kiri got leaked a week before
kiri did get leaked tho
gx was obviously president campaign so they didn't had time<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
oh america
who did you mean with werent involved? the illuminati?
well kaneko actually likes ssj now bcs of xdu <a:15min:490152482429861898>
literally in the description on the trailer for xv
they have mentioned this was the final season
yes?
bcs liek you probably want to compare whatever solo si talking about in jp
<:15min:495770478678638593>
joe is going to ask louis anyway
this is where we go kanekooooooo <:YAMERO:399893333046067201>
she's a cyborg
<:15min:495770478678638593>
hitler was shit guy but economy wise nobody was better then him
<a:15min:490152367631630346>
oh yeah
he's doing it for interest of japan
he isnt actually evil
chaotic neutral
really?
after all it is a hibiki focused ep so not surprised it seems very hibiki
but staff/cast hype isnt the same as audience hype
they almost never do
~~ilovemorefineincarnations~~
the antagonist from sun event is the main player of xd quest KA
yeah back to geah 😄
yeah
dont think anyone would attempt to do this in current year tbh
the first 2-3 weeks i was deja vu deja vu but on ep 4 i started picking up the oh so slight differences
thats aight
only madmen would animate every ep from scratch
yeah
i just like endless eight
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
who knows
sun event is the sequel to that
need to build up to xd main first
can't do sun event
same scene but framed differently in every episode
likely but its an option: https://i.stack.imgur.com/OFPd9l.jpg
the plotlines could be the same but you can change it up with angles and such
yeah
same but diffenret
hence i would treat it as a endless 8 type of thing
they could parallel world  it easily
nah
because thats just event 1 with a different ending
idk how they would handle event 3 though
mikuverse is also big but all the other events are pretty limited in scale so hard to properly adapt
so there's actually material to adapt it properly
well kanade verse makes sense because we have like 3 events building it
under normal circumstances
18
the sub isn't released yet
we watched it raw
or jap gov
its the UN that ceased SONG operations
and its not fudou that did the SONG stuff
because he would get elfnein in problems
gen wont do a thing
he wont
<:15min:495770478678638593>
he's just a normal human
but not even gen can stop bullets 360 degrees
people are also saying gen will fuck them up
the others arent
bikki is complete
thats the point naoto
they will probably get armor bits a la bikki
whats shown was just the undergear
the others have incomplete gears
its a bit of both honestly
( cr has it wrong yes)
<:harold:364119409620418591>
but man we always said aufwachen form wrong, its auf🇧 achen form
fudou literally gets described as a monster in the char synopsis iirc
http://symphogear-axz.com/keywords/key15.php
its die spinne
its why its wrong
ofc its not ryan
<:15min:495770478678638593>
also Dishupine's Barrier! > should be Die spinne
fudou works in the shadows ye
<:15min:495770478678638593>
when its spelled out for them
they can't even get keywords right
they would
same thing
you know what i mean
<:15min:495770478678638593>
same thing
and what was that shaft show called fuck
mazinger yea
instead of only having the live version
the good part is that we are finally getting the duet on an album
rip basa if that happens
maybe he can do it with sheer will
who knows
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
she can outrun them np
Sasami-san@Ganbaranai
https://imgur.com/gallery/rN60XzN
oh found it
no?
people keep posting jojo but gear literally never references jojo
its more X then it is jojo
~~they have to meet their inner self to be able to project their armed gear~~
so if one alchemist is removed from play they cant use it
don't forget that all 3 need to be there for Daedalus End
its alreayd a keyword but they'll probably expand on it on next weeks keyword update tbh
its gonna be a read the keywords
the point is that kaenko only did this because bikki and sg sang it live
imagine the highlight we might get on ep 9 now
the other 2 didnt sing duets
its only SG bcs of the duet live
nah they wont
remove the guns first
<a:15min:490152237151158274>
well she cant explain more now
if it was a one wonder then only bikki would have gotten it
clearly
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
poor saint seiya
that
that wont happen
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
that was their trump card btw
it might be bikki that made it explode tbh
its pretty restrictive ye?
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
sugita is self proclaimed worlds biggest nana fan
not for that
its not a duet unless its basa and ver
let him rest in peace
```BASA LOOK AT MY TITTIES```
those songs are going to be BD exclusive anyway
yeah melua, with edits to the episode
like chris did in g with ver
she's gonna use fudou
she's never gonna betray them
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1155207569255882754
thanks zoid
the philo stone was the key to cleaning their gear pendants in AXZ
with the philo stone
no all of them are
all of the gears are embed with the philo stone?
<:okay:330354891727962122>
it was nice
yeah
kaneko just used it
hence htey did it at the live
aoi wanted to sing with sg va
it was just a wish of aoi armados
they were
just about anything old and obscure
geahs already full of it so im expecting more
same
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
keywords
he can do that bcs of the law
oddly specific for things you want in a vr game
she's the only one who can change her gear output at will
basa is the master in transforming anyway
that's different tho
not long enough
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
like 50 seconds of bright white light
they should give us a villain view
and they needed a diversion
song can't detect alchs
imagine
😂
exploded
poor monster
<:15min:495770478678638593>

I just want fudou to use it, half bcs of memes and half bcs of sheer will to fuck the curse<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
people want millaarc dead so the labyrinth won't happen again
well
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
him scheming everything since the very start
working in the shadows
it's just the fudou way
he only got removed from Commander position bcs of the fuck up retrieving ichival iirc
he has access to all the records
he used to be div 2 leader
yes
watch ep5 opening be fudou talking with that japanese government dude and telling him about miku
if he doesnt still know, then he will know now for sure
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the twist is that fudou will use the gjallarhorn to use the ssj on himself so he can wield the vambrace himself
he won't
fuck that scene
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
you all seen miku's strength why so worried
```AXZ Episode 12[1][2]

A new law established in an effort to adapt to the recent outbreaks of supernatural disasters. 

A fair amount of force has been used in both its establishment and execution, causing it to become the target of much criticism by opposing parties. 

The law allows for the mobilization of the Japanese Self-Defense Forces not only in the event of singular disasters (the Noise), but also any disasters caused by relics or heretical technology. It was written so broad interpretations could be made to allow for flexible responses in the event of unforeseen disasters. 

It's enforcement can be quite ruthless, allowing for a termination (and prompt retreat) order against a target without the need for debate, as was the case for the Symphogear Adaptor who was consumed by the divine power. 

XV Episode 3[3]

It's a very important law, you must not gloss over it with a "whatever."```
it's why they introduced that new disaster law
law forbid doing that
with sheer will
fudou will use the brace
<:KagawaLife:404519449828392960>
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
if you want <:yummy:235243310086750208> just post xdu memoria with bikki and miku
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah i can see that doing that
have a kid
be wife and wife
live together
not the other way around
its maria lumping after basa like a puppy
besides the lives
basa ignores maria pretty hard tbh
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and its not maria
yes bcs there's only one for basa
i dont think they should anyway after 5 seasons just bcs its the end
they're still somewhat fucked up at times though
kaneko likes his happy ends
there wont be any deaths for the mains
kaneko says every time its going to be happy
ka summed it up pretty well except for the killing part
yeah
<:15min:241820657027907584>
like they cant even use it if one is missing
it's so handicapped though
you had another one this ep <a:15min:490152463555624991>
they recieve the subs from mages.
cr doesn sub gear
whoever does these should add a row for commie tbh
open in original
yeah that was good stuff
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
oh fuck wrong chat
also she wont fail her henshin like some people think
same
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and a half competent studio
~~ and a jealous bikki~~
yes gems is all about chris and miku shenigans
unlike main geah story
because they fucking remembered chris and miku
thats why i still live xdu gem event
<:harold:364119409620418591>
no time for love life
chris needs to focus on college
which is actually wrong but ok
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
and give it to cr
but yeah they hired the tl
yes
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mages_(company)
pls
mages.
but cr tends to have literal tls bcs they use the english script as a base for the other language subs
and other VA's getting more traction
and rie getting older
just a shift of archtype mains tbh
<:15min:495770478678638593>
make rie great again
just bring back rie in tsundere roles
or any other genre that exists
both males/females write shoujo
which doesnt matter if its written by whom
i dont think it being made by a woman or man actually matters
then again i've never been a big fan of oregairu like most other people i know
but yeah
LN*
<:15min:495770478678638593>
at least one tends to have nice action unliek the other
i'll still take bad isekai over the good old harem vn adaptations
same hero
<:15min:495770478678638593>
so al lwe need to do is watch 2 years worth of action movies
yeah
him being so strong is another question
fudou being 100+ isnt that much of a stretch
that are 100+
doesnt japan have the most old people in the world actually
so yes he can shoot the gear users
and he also has that law
he has it
unlike most other who just go for fancy stuff which they would have to reduce when animating
so he already adapts them to that
he's one of the few illustrators/designers who takes into account possible anime adaptations
its why I like abec/bunbun as a character designer so much
make the doorway bigger
but just for art they're pretty great
not overdesigned
the anime fausts are made wit hanime in mind
yeah
https://puu.sh/DYqIx.png
but the smirk is so good
prelati 
https://puu.sh/DYqIc.png
cag 
https://puu.sh/DYqHt.png
her smirk on max awaken is 10/10
preltati has good v2 tbh
yeah the concept art kaneko posts is pretty nice
upgraded versions in xdu story
and first
anime is second
https://puu.sh/DYqEe.png
its practically faust robe v2
but yeah i like one of them more also
i'll show SG just for comparison
they have 3 designs on XDU
the alchs?
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
wrong chat
like almost sure fudou is behind the jp gov doing this
probably bcs of fudou
yeah
at least jii said the right thing to kiri to not slice the nuke<:LUL:243896110001684480>
funds perhaps?
kdn has some pretty i love you sort of lines though
if they do it or not is a different question
bikkis b side is the perfect epilogue song
so only like full relics are an option now i think?
there's also no more pendants
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
sg to do her home work instead of miku
just what bikki needed
ye
name is too hard
if he was at full power he would have gold ability them afaik
he didn't fully recuperate
he used most of his power to forcibly open the gates in the air
he wasn't
I still wanted to see the gears fight him full power
<a:15min:490152482429861898>
and other guests from symphogear
with nana weekly guest for XV
ayahi and iguchi ye
ye it was a wish come true for her
well gungnir is the relic so what i said
not a shard of kanade gungnir me thinks
it's just a different piece of gungnir
i just watch live with the gang and thenm cr > yt
so basically XV will be almost over before AXZ is finished
they added ep 6 of axz this weekend
no they went from 2 eps a week to 1 ep a week
ill adopt all of them
but basa already transformed in ep 4 🤔
if i use FedEx or DHL it's faster ofc as they have their own customs offices but they also charge more and tax more
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
too bad cdjapan can't bypass the shitty customs here
yeah the the cds are available digitally on some japanese websites iirc
its gonna be fixed on bd 2 in november
they made a typo in ep 4 <:15min:495770478678638593>
and lol that amalgam keyword, we only tld half of it but it's so long already
don't think i posted it here but kabababa is in charge of tomorrows ep so there's actually a chance we can get basa transformation.
that one is at undeaditors <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
ye we are AK
yes its huge
it's in character so who cares
and thats also just bikki
she finally did it, which is what matters
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
it's why her scene in ep 4 is actually pretty important
it's really just basa doing basa things
they didn't forget
she's too cute
ill be disappointed if Elsa dies
bikki, millaarc and basa that is
the bg suggests they're at the same place
just wait for the bds where they include creditless op/ed
bd 2 is ost
yeh
if not they can just turtle in defense mode
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yeah so we'll see the others mastering amalgam hopefully
why so long kaneko
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://wiki.poweris.moe/wiki/Amalgam
nah he won't
it might just be a random for all we know
<:SerenaOhoho:586715673477251080>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
who doesn't like basa suffering
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
finally getting competition for <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:harold:364119409620418591>
the good thing is that the preview shows basa transformed again
<:15min:495770478678638593>
sakimori is actually tsubasa
half of the memes of today ep were from yesterdays radio
<:FeelsGoodEnoughMan:495181863745486858>
they namedropped YTT
2hs
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
yes
there's literally no reason to have it wrong
and keyword
🔥
so was that attack
yeh
this was just sympho radio the episode
but its generally not this extreme
ye
nobody will
so its cearly just a copout
but anyway this is synmphogear and they arent gonna kill off miku
same
and its gonna be the guy bcs noble red (millaarc) is gonna betray fudou
its clearly a copout cliffhanger
no
its just part of the plan of noble red betraying fudou
like
its so obvious its the guy
its the guy
yes yo uare
thgis is gear
its the guy
its not gonna be 119 or miku at all
100%
its the guy
and yes basa album is still delayed to 4 stember for whatever reason
nobody will die
they wont
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
theyre jsut doing a double backstab
vanessa mentioned it before they knew fudou was gonna backstab them
they alsways had a reason
```its clearly a copout cliffhanger
and its gonna be the guy bcs noble red (millaarc) is gonna betray fudou```
they're still after 119
doesnt matter
not miku
theyre after 119
and what joe said
but i has nothing to do with fudou
she could ye
she didnt kill the camera for no reason
millaarc killing hte guy means she can spoonfeed miku about the plans noble red has
fudou gave the order
it would
they dont know where they are
they cant'track miku or 119
and there wont be a single gear user who protected them
well they arent killing elfnein or miku so the only option is the rnado
i called out basa henshin this ep, you should trust me <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
millaarc destroyed the camera so fudou can't see what happening
its pretty easy to see whats he's doing ep per ep
kaneko lays out his plans pretty broad tho
one could assume she isnt pure of sin
which is like <:nani:241228065357824001>
noble red has the vambrace again
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
dads birthday
second bottle of wine is empty
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
but i need to stop drinking bcs i cant spell anymore
bc sits gonna go like what joe or me said
well then you weill be disappointed next week
^
HE'S NOT
he's gonna get rid of noble red as soon as he is done with his plans
fudou is never gonna allow them too
why does that matter?
^
and fudou isnt part of it
they clearly spelled it out last week
yes she does?
so she can tell song
for all we know it might just be noble red spoonfeeding miku about fudou plans
she might but she might not
she was working on faust robe technology
before the experiment failed and she got blown to pieces
vanessa was pretty hig hup
its a talk between 119 and gen
thats not written anywhere cypher
she's gonna remember her friends before she does stupid shit
i still dont think basa will actually side with fudou
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
bless millaarc or giving us one of the best basa scenes
holy fuck its good
the defender'z song?
cypher why
<:panic:282277202995970048>
idk why im actually still awake
yes
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
kept me awake
i liked this tbh
but most of it its pretty thrown at your face
ofc not <:15min:495770478678638593>
kaneko please
that broken entry isnt actually in the original chatteau
gen would never use boss when talking to yatsuhiro
wtf?
like ```boss```
cr has it weird tbh
LOL
the original is also seriously good
thats about carol
like
```Until the day I see you again, the moment I can see you again
I don't want to talk about our parting
It's just too lonely
It's just too pointless
Because we'll just hurt each other and lose everything

We'll close the door together
We'll say our goodbyes
And at that moment our hearts will understand

Until the day I see you again, the moment I can see you again
I don't want to know
I don't want to ask
Where you are, or what you're doing
Because we'll begin to care for each other again

We'll close the door together
We'll say our goodbyes
And at that moment our hearts will understand

We'll close the door together
We'll say our goodbyes
And at that moment our hearts will understand```
its really just 119 singing about carol
i still had it copied from dotv
just read the lyrics
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://wiki.poweris.moe/wiki/Mata_Au_Hi_Made
they actually remind me of 119 singing about carol
the lyrics are pretty eh
bikki probably said something off screen we didnt hear
i actually feel bad for 119 bcs that song was super cool and it was degraded to background noise
we knew it was gonan come this ep, just not at what point
well the nazo spelled it out pretty clearly tbh
basa is childs play
bcs of bikki
she already suffers enough
miku doesnt need suffering
stop
no
<:15min:495770478678638593>
sakimori is the sentinel of /r
<:nani:241228065357824001>
but leave that random slash
but like they build the whole first floor
the slash would have been there
its not on the og pic
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
i would put the blush on the blood
they should get mixed tbh
i wonder how they actually call him in the credits
the name should be in the credits
<:15min:495770478678638593>
basa changes bust every season so its hard t ogauge
soon™
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
at least the upside is that apparently kaneko had the ending of gear in mind ever since s1
they paid for the rights so might as well
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
should be fun to dub several songs over it tbh
<:harold:364119409620418591>
they also gave her fat thighs
she's probably pretty grateful
geah sort of launched her singing career so ye
poor basa
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
kaneko:you know that unnamed girl that died in s1?
let's have her sing genocide and genocide
was one of the random unnamed girls
she played in s1
yeah
they sound how they were supposed to sound like now
they're fully remastered
yes
G had the same problem with zababa songs on the bds
which wouldnt be the first time
and that they have to do a remaster
and they didnt push back basa henshin so like the only option is that they fucked up mastering it really
they already recorded everything
the delay is weird
basa is delayed to 4 septmeber
already gonna be halfway through the season next week oof
and when is it saturday <:WorstTimeline:451521970266177536>
alreayd took several miku screenshots to use as avatar but waiting for xv to be over
~~it also has leiurs sister as an option~~
and mammu and autoscorers have like either 0 or 1 vote
ogawa
~~theres a poll on gamewith on which char you would like ot bne added adn carol is winning it~~
animate and stuff tends to send a day early
~~just invite hocchan to the live~~
i doubt they'll even have time for serena with current flow
yeah we wont
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
she wont be a "stand"
not that
neither is serena <:15min:495770478678638593>
ATX has always been 3 days late
nothing
it airs normal hour on other channels
dont forget thats only for MBS
well im not clicking it
it would be nana cover
actually
a shower song
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
we should at least get sugita singing
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
xv website, inspect element for the original <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
and the livestreams all use tokyo mx
it wont
which isnt gonna happen as much i want it too happen
it's gonna be status quo
Sakura trick was also pretty profitable
granted it's an ova
just look at fragtime
```Unfortunately, gay isn't as profitable```
I wouldn't say that's true tbh
it's sort of the same as the bikki one in the preview
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>

Nana has been in every kojima work
who knowz
finally radio and interview after 5 seasons
bless him
2 weeks
the week after is also fujitaka iirc
the vambrace bcs NR betrayed fudou<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
ytt leak
```明日
tomorrow
but they also LOVE to use them interchangeably
they'll write future and pronounce it tomorrow or vice versa
not here though```
but more like tomorrow
future doesnt mean miku in this case
no
they arent going to kill a major character
and it being stupid to change it being x seasons in
or bushiroad artist
xdu artist who makes those comics
ye that was already resolved in ep 5
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://wiki.poweris.moe/wiki/Training
cr isn't till like 7 or 8
it's done for 15mins
and miku <:harold:364119409620418591>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
well all i say is that cypher was wrong and everyone else was right
its not a piece of tiki
Unless godmiku i guess
they don't have anything to cleanse it<:15min:495770478678638593>
she still has the sin so how would that even work
the others would have to get cleared of the sin first tho
God bikki already reversed the effects, 119 commented on it
anti linker didn't do anything but helping miku shout to bikki
well its not a gear for starters
use them as condensors
not activate i think
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
but a god
she won't even be a relic
they confirmed kiris will be uncut next time it's shown when they first showed it
the only thing that was missing
it had the philostone start
first half is half recap <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
it wasn't fine?
Maria and Chris had good teamwork tbh
the ghost calling out to miku had the vambrace on
it was obvious though, not only did they place miku next to the vambrace
Das miku
yes
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
to channel the power of the vambrace
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
it's the prevolution
<:harold:364119409620418591>
yes and they failed
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
```holy shit i just had a thought
what if ver comes out of the egg```

Hot take
have you guys seen the hot take yet?
```in the famous scene where the guy is riding on the car's hood, he says 世界の果てを見せてあげよ, and here we have the driver say 世界の果てを見せてくれ```

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EBoeYsyW4AAdBhR.jpg
yes
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
and the chris car scene was indeed an utena reference
where the patterns on the zoomed out shot were different then the close up
i was more amused by the screens of the bag at the HQ
never had something fell out of a bag?
well they werent mean to kidnap miku either way
they at least know about ssj relic
they also knew about lame so knowing about miku isnt all that surprising
lot of fails
there's triple didget autoscorers so yeah
those are failed autoscorers so doubt they will actually have any importance besides being power conduits
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
its the screen gen and co are looking at
same cut
<:smug:239129154061205505>
so that would be weird
well its the same shot
she does
all so late
and shoot them
alcanoise he can just slice <:15min:495770478678638593>
then maybe
if he can uncarbonize every cell of his body?
fudou doesn't have it
it's going too fast to be fudou also
it's not going to be miku or fudou
no
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
kaneko already said its going to be a happy end
and the s1 callback
thats not just the heart
but he also shared images of shit in the henshin scene that should be in the full
the animator who did it said so
piccies friday, despair Saturday <:ADAM:338363978797547539>
millaarc is pretty different as far as her roles go
kasumin is a more genki aimi
<:15min:495770478678638593> `
they're just best friends <:15min:495770478678638593>
it is
I'm betting on authoring/production problems bcs all the songs were finished before XV started airing
should have kept them guessing solo
ye few months

誕生日：4月13日？ 16歳
血液型：Ｏ
身長：155cm
BWH：82／56／83
im sure
its on the xv website
for majority of the series
nothing is as trustworthy as checking the official websites and see how many bds volumes they have announced <:15min:495770478678638593>
mal is slow on updating that sort of stuff anyway
bds confirm its 13 eps
they should not include the final half tbh
the end was AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
like that first scene was AAA cool
?
like this
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
*screaming*
its well worth the wait
when ep airs
its better to like ban geah hashtags so they dont show up
yeah
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
millaarc ability isnt fool proof
either you house carol or be a fool
well
its spare bodies
yeah
it arent their original bodies
I WANT MY RENT
where is my rent
lmao
<:15min:495770478678638593>
she has no memories to burn
well she can't grow big anyway
tiny but full of power solo
god i love how phara bullshitted the swords just like how basa did it
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
imagine option 3
ssj rocks around
its likely influenced by the eh
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://puu.sh/E6nqQ.jpg
look at frieza junior fetus
not really much time for that
or at least her ancenstors were
ye
maria, basa, chris also
theyre the gx album poses
for micha
its kiri and jii poses
just needs some sleep
she'll be fine
cant interrupt the henshin so interrupt the song
it fits
i like it
cant be a villain if you're just comatose
<:15min:495770478678638593>
its a bait and switch
well its carolnein to be precise <:15min:495770478678638593>
who to meme now
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
elf9 no longer useless
hence it looks like it moves so fast
its just not bullshitting around like the other seasons
the whole of xv has been moving fast anyway
the really only bad scene switch was the vanessa walking up saying something  and scene changing to  broken autoscorers
sugita would meme so hard
poor elza
https://puu.sh/E6ojT.webm
so she might end up singing genocide again
inori is pretty much confirmed now with the new song
go to live 2020 <:15min:495770478678638593>
she was shivering when carolnein used her shield and was summoning the harp
elsa knows whats up
https://twitter.com/michiyo_murase/status/1162774834184511488
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECMBiw0UwAAFnCn.jpg:large
well carol doesnt have any relationship with the other alchs for the most part
assuming she does manage to save miku, then what
i want to see next ep to see what will actually happen with carolnein
also pretty nice
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1162823826742419461
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
swan song is fodder
so maybe carol could link in some way that to her faust robe to burn memories for alchemy usage
phara did mention they might have wanted to use their latent memories for their purposes of containing the annuki
she could perhaps use the chateau
and on the memory burning achemy thing
remember that they standed toe to toe with ignite gears
and pretty weakened
and the autoscorers remark it are spare bodies
^
it wasnt?
even after the henshin
its still elfnein in body
its hard to gauge
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
lol
so will have to see how they will tackle that next ep
and alchemy in case of carol uses memories
<:15min:495770478678638593>
likely never will
elf9 can't use alchemy like that as far as we know
carol likely stepped in the moment she used her shield
both
yes
so its carol
minase was speaking
he's unlikely to be cleaned up tbh
he fell down into the chateau god knows where
its in the preview pics so yes
and not for some omnious thing
god bless the cute basa was for that scene after
<:15min:495770478678638593>
also getting energy drained is hard even for bikki
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and he wasnt a god
i mean she lsot to adam if it wasnt for the other gears
<:smug:239129154061205505>
the ribcage tho
just call her carolnein
maybe keywords will explain something on friday
wait till next week really
tbh dino
https://i.imgur.com/nYIzJda.jpg
swan song will never be a problem again
no
oh the gajin chart is out
pretty useless besides s1 an i guess kiri axz which was fine 5mins later
it still should have happened before
in case of basa
it should have already happened tbh
yeah that was weird ending
ytt is out
im still not worried
she sort of is?
wrong but cute
<:15min:495770478678638593>
still cute
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
he does them
just blame joe
<:15min:495770478678638593>
~~for people that use ytt, do you like the puns~~
but like a good boy i await preview piccies
yes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
all bark and snow bite was the pun this ep
<:15min:495770478678638593>
she will be at the live guaranteed
other alchs dont have to burn memories
also cypher, carol is just an outlier
i know cypher but keywords <:15min:495770478678638593>
so phonic gain by singing isnt gonna work
keywords explicitly state carols alchemy is only fueled by memories
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
but like on a live? i can totally see it happening
its probably not happening in the anime
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
ever since 2012 when s1 was gonna air
yes chris
i,v ebeen following it for 7 years now or so
<:EverythingGonnaBeDaijobu:281118212936957952>
so carol song is probably gonna be bd4
HY version amalgam is on bd3
unlike XV
but we knew there was a secret cd beforehand
not sure for carol, maybe the same
back in G, they already leaked a secret cd release
0
its not their bodies of GX
it are spare bodies
granted its a multi media project anyway
s2 and s3
bang dream
just no slices or raw tomato
yeah ill eat ketchup and the likes or peices on pizza, spaghetti and whatnot
i dont like tomatoes
~~tomatoes~~
instead of proper food
or just snacks
that also
you can see my ribcage and i eat a lot
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
maybe she just doesnt gain any weight
as nobody can make them into pendants
it doesnt even matter if they have more relics or not
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
at most ver will appear in a flashback if they're gonna tackle more maria/serena
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
or in G
instead of like s1 where it mattered more
imagine getting this in XV
https://wiki.poweris.moe/wiki/Model_Numbers
most important
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
sneeze
```The mechanism is difficult to properly anticipate, and in some cases the sudden expulsion of air can create complicated expressions. ```
<:harold:364119409620418591>
technically neither does carol
would actually be surprised if she doesnt get her own keyword
https://wiki.poweris.moe/wiki/Category:Keyword
looks like friday is the perfect time to give her, her own keyword
119 doesnt have her own keyword
regardless of what it is
its just elfnein body with carol taken over
sg did the philo stuff
ignite is actually carol
she didnt
shouldnt 119 have sang then
the one from G
the helicopter is also from america
<:15min:495770478678638593>
america that is
yeah they made it in a lab led by ver
but modified
its the device elfnein uses
ver
<:15min:495770478678638593>
xv confirmed nobody can make pendants
the theory on how to make a pendant was public since end of s1
its fine only
ver cant make pendants
yes student to lydian but theres alo a lot of other people
well without a fusion bikki wouldnt have been in the show <:15min:495770478678638593>
what wfc said
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
had to differentiate kanade, bikki and maria after all
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
```hey i found these notes from years ago explaining model numbers```
s1 would just be number without any indication
the r would be added for g or so
updated again for gx
updated for g
it could have been released in s1
they update keywords all the weay through the series
well
yeah its the event on how gen got commander
its not explained
nobody knows
<:15min:495770478678638593>
nobody knows how chris got the ichivial pendant
theres actually another one AK
<:15min:495770478678638593>
clearly being free of sin also gives you superhuman power
miku threw away the pimpcane
how are they gonna do that
blown up to a billion pieces
destroyed
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
they jsut dont have a spare pendant laying around
ye
didnt grab it
they had the chance this ep
they usually use it earlier
the ep even started with dmjii
dmjii duet when tho
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
thnks kiri
wing might know for nana
ayahi always has cover songs so not that surprised
so like 2 weeks
4th sept
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/191421124507074560/613403212887752737/unknown.png
please
ed is also released today iirc
friday is all i need
it's not a ayahi release without a cover song<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
yep
that's a cover song
people never heard of the original?
same
Miki Shinichirou 11/10
she does enough
🤔
that's bikkis song already
ye
at most she'll get a sol song
miku isn't going to fight
not a battle song at least
when
thats it
its just a 119 likes using the device off duty
i dont think the show actually ever said 119 is looking for carol
<:15min:495770478678638593>
like actually make 119 not terrible at anything
carol's probably gonna leave a gift at most
i wish but she wont
while basa arc final is starting in the second half of the ep
carol gonna temporarely beat up NR, escape with miku and disappear
and he also suffered from axz being a season that goes into a continuation
adam is what hero said
```special sand from the desert where they recorded the music video```
a big one at that
i actually think its just a typo
yeah
```Right now “fighting magical girls” are sweeping the world, but when I was a kid, "magical girls" were mainly elementary school kids who used a transformation wand to become an adult and then go around resolving various problems. That was the idea on which her character was based, so I suppose if you were to label her, Carol is a "Showa era fighting magical girl." ```
found it
someoen found back an interview on why they made carol grow up
reminds me
that you can see without the shinais
and they're still not important to the plot
but yes ive seen the shinais
what im trying to say is that ytt is a bunch of gear geeks that consumed pretty much everything thats available
same
says to watch the shinais when you're in the group who did the shinais <:smug:239129154061205505>

they dont really matter for plotpoints
shinais arent canon
ah

<:smug:239129154061205505>
intern-kun just fell asleep thats all
it was slightly
almost an hour
the worst was ep 5 tho
they've never been on time since the first 2 eps <:15min:495770478678638593>
totally not stolen
tomorrow
bcs lol fudou eyes
is my guess
second half of the ep will start basa so yeah
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and basa is in geah mode so she's safe again this ep
they wouldnt have added character page for carol else
its carol
it should be pretty huge
if they namedrop on ep 8 and the nazo is metonia lyrics
there's always 1 image that shakes
<:hyp:250363576005558272>
title drop on ep 8
and its happening
~~as expected~~
carol song confirmed for bds
but thats a guess
it might be related to aws having problems
they would have already announced a delay
there isnt
they will
```Episode 08 "XV"

As perfection nears completion, the imperfect are close in pursuit.
Public and private. A deeper plan hidden beyond even those.
In spite of this, you face the wall separating you from the Future, although you will never reach it.

What do you believe in, what is your choice? Unable to comprehend the truth,
you have no idea how to proceed as they fade away— the rainbow of someday, the memories of flowers.```
tiki was the one closest to being controlled
bikki couldnt either though
he planned to use it to destroy shem-ha
after bikki it went in his arm
but he was able to harness it?
it was destroyed after

so i need <:blobpopcorn2:337526691222126602> for that
i should rewatch the ep but zoid started watching the ep
it sure is
she burned phonic gain
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
WHAT THE FUCK
krika
gonna be a fun 5 weeks next

<:LUL:243896110001684480>
it actually looks like the adam foreshadowing
if you want cr subs
subs are out
||wonder how they'll get miku's mind back||
the ep is out
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
why are we speaking in spoiler tags even
||it has the waveform bcs they used ssj to contain shem-ha relic, its a hybrid between them||
||doesn't mean its ssj||
||its a hybdrid between shem-ha and ssj||
||its not ssj||

CR please
oh god
the others are only at the cocoon stage
and only bikki has unlocked offensive amalgam
yeah
and in shield mode its the perfect defense
amalgam is the perfect offense
should bcs this is gear
amalgam should be stronger then xd
he'll pull a carol and revive
FC full is <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
japan big brain
not mine
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
15=XV
mikusan
also called 393 in japanese
3+9+3=15
you could follow the big brain japanese strat for that hero
we're sure
basa actually used her manga attack
they just used different attacks
theyre the GX versions
no
just new attacks
on phonecall
https://puu.sh/E92wh.png
do like i did voyeur
not counting the shinais
at least they had screentime unlike in axz
but tbh
unpaid work
free of charge
they're doing it because they love gear
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
that would have been enki
carol: bro do you even phonic gain
also carol
to make a pseudo personality
with the machine
copy pasting leftover memories that 119 found inside her head is a pretty good hack
thank elfnein for that
can bikki punch miku
the problem is

magic
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
so if she doesnt have it, she'pretty much dead weight
the luggage is what has her disposal of weapons
well its rather important
breath
breath
dont die on us solo
thats a welcome
welcome
ah hello solopy
BD
blueray disc
the volume release that has the carol song
blueray 4
bd4 is such a long wait <:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
it was a nice touch for sure
so it doesnt really do anything
didnt really do anything tho
you might as well insert airgetlame on the henshin for miku
bcs in the end sympho still needs that fansrevice shoehorned in
it wasnt but they still did it
dino is a little special
<:obama:439779824299540491>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
that can cut the divine
how do you guys feel about chateau also being a philosophical weapon
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
just look at XV visuals from posters how stacked basa actually is
in show it just isnt
official art of basa is probably like the most consistent for basa
its never ever consistent
basa changes size depending on what content you're looking at
```Imagine that The 13th chapter it will last 40 minutes```
i would die
its still weird they havent done zababa duet for that matter
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
a la alchemists in axz release
miku will be reserved for when they release that half of xv
carol soonest
<:15min:495770478678638593>
plenty of xdu content from xv so far
shem-miku, xd drive new abilities, amalgam gears, normal new abilities, carol
well solo
you mean the aigis helmet
welcome to the club nougat
they released it digitally about everywhere

want it
<:15min:495770478678638593>
solopy
EternalOblivion96
just post the ytt wikia for all keywords <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
you better win tickets kaliks
<:nana:348253132981141504>
they didnt really have another option
he would get in trouble for that
it wont
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
tv streams are just bad
the blur is just ghosting from the broadcast
you cant really count he copy/paste thing here
carol is just a cheat
it's shemha based on ssj
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
good thing it's not ssj
<:15min:495770478678638593>
hehe
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
she's just gonna slam it a few times
this is bikki
it wont
not until next year when they add xv
so both are right and wrong
<:15min:495770478678638593>
well its not ssj
yeah its gonna be a wait and see with fudou here
then again, i dont think a literal god would need ssj powers to pull things like that
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
not gonna happen
```pretty convinced shem-ha will pull the relic erasing properties from the SSJ shards, which is functionally the same shit as having SSJ```
which basically means  the gears have not a single win option lmao
so its not ver
he did say the arm
same
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/231447613122150401/614972474328743938/dhYP1VU.png
shemha is a bracelet from a literal god
none
"my job here is done"
but you didn't do anything
always had legs ye
the fetus?
he is
there's so much variables to think of a power ranking would be stupid tbh
to melua
ye
recap
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
at least we know what next weeks opening scene will be
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
dejavu
it's probably stronger then ssj
>ignite
good pic solo
miku is technically kill
fuck autocorrecting phone
that would be a good shinai, solopy
how can it be his fault
Adam was the guy trying to stop this
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
they already have an alien amongst their mids
Time to hit the sack and get ready for more XV tomorrow <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
~~i would worship it with that body~~
maybe all it wants is to get worshipped
her mind must be somewhere
i feel like miku's mind is in the bracelet now instead of shemha's
or that
and the body down was a projection
what i mean with it that her body was already in the cocoon since the start
let me finish breakfast
oh that
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
New day, new rewatch
<:harold:364119409620418591>
fudou has enlil in his back yard
its meh when its closed
the visor ris nice when its open
i dont actually want mikugeah but i can live with this
very likely
so easy we will go why didnt we think of that
its all gonna be easy
dont make it too difficult
solo no
<:15min:495770478678638593>
poor elza
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
unless hibiki finds happiness without miku
but staying dead? likely not
sure
die and revived
and someone dying from the main cast isnt part of that
kaneko also said happy ending
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
followed by an insert of dont lose your way
wherever her mind might be
miku trying to resist from within
thats a possibility i can see tbh
i wouldn't be surprised they sideline shem-miku for a bit but its not gonna span longer then 2 eps
they still need to do all the other stuff
shem-miku is gonna be over sooner then later
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
gears can deal with that np
only a side effect
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
they could just open portals to send the nukes in
if they still had the cane of solomon
but they do have a backup in the worst case
its clearly bikki that gonna do it
but it can cut through the divine <:15min:495770478678638593>
it would destroy the world
<:15min:495770478678638593>
that can cut through the divine
the chateau is also a philosophical armanent
the chateau? yeah
<:15min:495770478678638593>
carol is
carol can also destroy it
gear is a prequel to a lot of series it seems lmao
adam existed to prevent this though
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
db parody is <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
<:eeh:242112096584728576>
they fix animation errors
but the epsiode directors are still the same so its totally fine
too many
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
its just small details that make the show
no
it was
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
amalgam
YTT XV out
the dress was amazing
etc and etc
it probably would have looked like gungnir if it was bikki
or airgetlame if it was maria
maybe they will fix the wrong color on the segway noise
yes
<:smug:239129154061205505>
but then again they also forget to fix the obvious ones
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
https://puu.sh/E9kxa.jpg
i may or may not have this open
well solopy
~~guilty crown~~
```Oh wait, she woule be a granny if that's the case```
yukachi dresses like a granny half of the time so im not surprised lmao
chris is just gonna be some gundam
or end of axz
underwear would be end of ep 1
thats amalgam like i said earlier
ghosting is just a side effect of being tv broadcast
dimming happens in every bright scene
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:smug:239129154061205505>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
im sort of expecting for her to walk off tbh
```Yuka iguchi is probably  excited she has new songs to sing in the next sympholive```
she would have anyway courtesy of potential xdu songs
it was shown
all they did in x drive was protect bikki
doesnt mean they can't try
```In the "cocoon" stage, defensive ability is greatly raised while attack power is greatly hampered.
In the "imago" stage, attack power is greatly raised while defensive power is greatly hampered. ```
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
basa suffering never ends
its not gonna do anything
its worse now then it was in s1
and not for bikki
if it actually had any meaning it would have been used for basa
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
she's gonna punch out miku's soul
she's not gonna punch shem-ha
and i tell you the condition red isnt actually gonna do anything
im proud of her
119 did well the past 2 eps
she would have probably done it if 119 didnt stop her to go after miku
on that carol comment
honestly
from what it looked like yeah
its less farstretched then some other things ive seen
its a possibility tbh
that assumes miku has been awake at one point
he probably has something
`he is a man with a plan
i like cooler weather
and i hate it
same
ima go watch
oh that reminds me that one dude uploaded his live reaction
There's elza who has a new VA and thats about it
the al lget pretty heavy hitter VA's for most of their roles
just look at who voices the 3 stooges lmao
just blame sugita for more ver really
but sugita made him into a meme so they reused him
remember that ver was supposed to be a throw away
well was <:15min:495770478678638593>
he's both the visionary and the curse
and everyone but 1 and a half studio adapted that viewpoint
its the model Osamu Tezuka popularized
it has always worked like this since the beginning
no
~~if only every studio was like kyoani or ufotable~~
Kouta is a series director
ono is the director
take XV
a series director isnt a director
the chart is somewhat wrong with the series director anyway
<:15min:495770478678638593>
no
she's fine now at least and can sing again
she had to get multiple throat operations
and they still had a sunday to go
like ucchi lost her voice completely on the final live (midway through the saturday)
she shouldn't overdo it and end up with health problems
if she keeps this up its good enough
doubt she'll go higher
inase is at peak popularity right now
because its yukachi....
wasnt it like second week of september 🤔
well nintendo gonna release it worldwide anyway so i might grab it when i finally buy my switch xd
it releases next month doesnt it
they did the order zero prologue animation
for satelight
and yeah its Daemon X Machina
satelight is still on symphogear GX banner 🤣
i wish satelight updated their website
thats kawamori in a nutshell tbh
<:smug:239129154061205505>
studio doesn't mean as much as the staff thats attached to it
lmao
when are they singing now that carol dropepd them the hint
<a:15min:490152482429861898>
~~also happens to be a kazanari~~
gen did it
i didnt say that
but not before
i would call her rone now
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
calling a whatever small fragment a separate entity sounds weird to me
yep
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
mindjumping was useful after all
119 kickstarted all of it
or carol at all
so we wouldnt have gotten the carol fucks of millaarc scene
carol wouldnt have been able to do it
but if 119 wasnt doing the mindjumping
she wasnt
its what the copy/paste refers towards
with all the mindsearching leftover memories 119 found
the ep mentions that the part of carol still in elfnein stitched together a pseudo personality of her
she reconstructerd herself
i doubt that will work to remove a god
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i have 150 15min emotes
god please no more 15min emotes
after xv or a few months after from what i gathered
the big kajiuu is just divine power
```unless we're going for the Majin Buu sort of absorption, in which case it's not irreversible.```
it is though
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
<@139432096023183360>    heres an archive we totally forgotten about
so its probably true
they reference it again in xv
soul cutting is apparently a real thing
maybe this week <:Elfnein:231434633357688833>
i also expected a keyword on 119 last week but we didnt either
well i dont think copy paste can be applied to fine memories
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
the closest thing to gear are the shinais
if kaneko wasnt a game writer first, sympho might actually have a decent plot throughout the seasons
<:okay:330354891727962122>
why make it a suffering end when you can do a happy end and make the other 12 eps suffering
<:EveryFuckingDay:585605813519777802>
no suffering
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and kaneko is a hack
he always wrote happy ends
its still very kaneko writing
yes
granted people like jumping the gun and thought the concept movie is for a new movie
but thats about it
they released that concept movie
but enki caused the curse to activate
maybe the gods actually just move on body to body
so is likely prev shem-ha user
just that he wore shem-ha bracelet
we dont
that wasnt enki
rahki means the mummy
no
wild arms gacha game that is <:15min:495770478678638593>
but the wild arms protagonist is the villain in the new wild arms game
we talked about this in dotv yesterday a bit
enki looked like a cool guy
idk how greece managed to do in symphoverse
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
but adam was actually right all along
and so would adam
carol would ahve still fucked over the world
well solo
so they couldnt change body to body anymore as nobody as clean of the curse
she's just gonna unearth that giant laser she left on the moon
i wouldnt be surprised if shem-ha just fucks off either and leave the gears dumbfounded
but both refer to the gear users
the only thing you need to remember is that adaptor and harmonizer are different <:15min:495770478678638593>
yes
it sounds more likely the others betrayed enki
alca-noise is super old thing anyway
the illuminati just doesn't really exist anymore
they havent lost the recipe
noble red is still ex-illuminati
until someone finds the recipe <:15min:495770478678638593>
there's no more alca-noise either when they run out of vials
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
these kazanari's sure ruin everything
as usual
hey its the kazanarri's again
so far so good tbh
that would be nice
bd4
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
its from the after credits of AXZ
~~let them spoil the plot ~~
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
its done
https://twitter.com/YameteTomete/status/1165964271358025729
shem-ha looks like it
all of them will be
not just gungnir
yeah
thats what we will find out soon enough
doesnt mean it actually has the delete powers
i dont think it actually was
but thats gone now so
yeah just the fetus wasnt
the throw away energy wasnt
miku was yeah
the baby was excessive energy remember
well not really
if she stays yea but if she fucks off nah
depends on how they handle it
the bracelet? nah different
the scorpion perhaps
no
we dont actually know what the thing in the OP is iirc
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
someone also mentioned but i dont remember where, that the miku transformation has the same color as the bracelet in the opening with the scorpion running over
but i blame maria for not remembering
tbh they should have been able to realize without involving him
no idea
lmao
https://twitter.com/max_tevo/status/1165947679064645632

you're pretty much the only editor left for this stuff anyway xD

its now yours <:15min:495770478678638593>
thats on you kaliks

they all know the full script now since all eps are recorded now <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yeah whats true and whats not
she probably just didnt get the hint
he did tell her
the difference in animation quality is pretty big
GX vs XV

hmm screenshotting like this doesnt actually show it that well
before satelight  took over
but the actual studio also went 🔥
its actually eh pretty bad
it is
you dont actually want more of the western fandom in geah <:15min:495770478678638593>
anitubers should just leave gear alone
<:15min:495770478678638593>
she's also married
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
~~sell extra tickets if you win more then 1~~
maybe a bit more
probably
<:kappa:281531248634232842>
i have 600 bucks total for 5-6 bd1 and 5-6 bd2 atm
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
like the old scalping prices
300 bucks for a guaranteed ticket worth it
well
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
there's literally like just the gamers boxset thats worth getting
god bless geah store exclusives are pretty bad
which isnt really worth it for 2 songs
you can get them second hand but at a big markup
but i just can't buy the cds that are limited by buying a whole set of bds at x store
like im also pretty big on LL and have almost all of the cds
its easier for geah bcs they dont have like venue limited  cds or cds for buying x storechain
100% completion
i have all of geah music <:harold:595434251286085653>
pls
and own a lot of geah stuff
i just have a lot of geah stuff on pc
~~bcs i have everything~~
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
it cut the aufwachen intro from all the ops and use them as clock, sms and call etc
👌

for actual vocielines go watch axz shinais
they had more screentime already in xv
god bless for nitro
example inc
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
the best songs are the aufwachen form openings anyway
most just fall flat
there's some pretty good ignite versions
~~maria actually looks cool in that xv shot opposed as in gx~~
ignite is gone so you will never see it again
well im just using she because its mikus body
she wont be
so shemha  going somewhere else has a big chance of happening
remember that all the gear are down besides bikki
majority of them do
they just need to get someone else for the ost <:15min:495770478678638593>
sawano feat *insert solo singer* is pretty good
sawano is still the best when he simply does OPs
character themes being the same is normal tho
unlike sawano
she actually switches up
yeah it does
and he's on like 20 now
sawano is good music but it gets too repetitive  after 2 series
rather not
they were friends but it was actually nana and agematsu being the big friends
they're all under elements garden though
there's multiple composers
ye
DIE 4 an IDEAL
and if you need to get pumped up you have the almost all caps song in axz
one of my favs for axz
adams track is also pretty great
most of the ost tracks are pretty stellar
Shinjitsu ga Kimi wo Kowashite Iku fromn G is also nice
ye
from cd 3
yea

the ost version
i love the school anthem personally
they're currently using it as that temp hide-out anyway
he has carol now
```At the end of a fierce battle, it collapsed above the former metropolitan government building and fell under the management of the Kazanari Organization.

However, due to the complex interaction of a number of heretical technologies, the situation must be handled very carefully and demolition of the structure has been proceeding slowly.

Its breathtaking presence rises to the heavens like a gravestone. ```
destroying a building isnt just 1,2,3 bombing
and its fudou
because its made out of relics
but sometimes you do have to rebuild parts for stability
they're demolishing it
chatteau isnt getting rebuild
....
eh
he is offline so ill just pm him and drop the answer when he replies
but tl dr is you are wrong
sometimes i wish johhny was here bcs he can tell you about chris
she doesn't need one anymore
chris had her arc in AXZ
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the part where they introduce conceptual weapons in the series
well xdu has 1 canon part
please
main character is doing main character things
it doesnt work that way
the god slaying is conceptual
nor actually wears gungnir now
maria wasnt cleansed by ssj
but it is <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
as long hibiki is the god-killer that is not going to change
<a:15min:490152463555624991>
miku isnt though
and she is a she
what part of adam was actively trying to destroy the coffin and shemha dont you get
and it would have appeared that moment anyway
adam would have sought it out
adams plan was to destroy shem ha
then again being udner adam didnt also seem like the best idea
more like shemha wouldnt have been a thing if they let adam do what he wanted to do
lmao
indeed
thats the true error
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
at one timeframe
they actually appear completely regenerated btw
🤔
its clearly intentional
ye
its not an animation error.....
it didnt fully regenerate
even after regenerating
the baby did take damage
and as you can see in the latest ep
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
build a secret hideout in it solopy
and who knows what useable relics there are in the chateau
it wouldnt
his face would be glorious
honestly i would love america to send a missile to japan jsut to see fudou's face
thats just a theory
no
for nicknames?
hibiki is a perfectly normal japanese name
well what do you mean with weird name to begin with
its totally fine
she uses it at one point
bikki also has the spear
<:smug:239129154061205505>
her fists
she wields a weapon
final ep
axz
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
notignite xdrive s2ca hyper amalgam mode
<:eeh:242112096584728576>
who are they gonna use for that
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
who knows what secrest lay there
it also rest on the old goverment building
its just out of service
it is
he shares it with some other people
he doesnt actually write the script for the anime
the concept yea
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
thats about the only thing that would be left of ver
the arm should still exist
well
ver is confirmed dead through the keywords so got to take a bit of salt with that
so no they havent brought something back
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
ver was alive bird
before it returned previous ep
we just dont know what happened with it
it wasnt
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
carol wasnt completely dead
they did
they havent actually brought something back that was completely destroyed didnt they
hikasa would have fun with that
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
so probably beats the gears no powerup solo
stronger then gen
he sure could have gone down into the rabbit hole
i mean fudou went to the chateau before
esp in gear
but i doubt they would go that far
theoretically that is an option
<:15min:495770478678638593>
which would still be alive
its the nephilim
his arm is a relic
yeah its made  out of multiple relics and heritical technology
or carol could have done it in the ep to yeet out noble red
the problem is harder then just activating
<:smug:239129154061205505>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
the green fire is that thing we see with millaarc yeeting enemies
so thats when we saw the green fire before
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
and that green fire appears
im rewatching that gx scene o f 119 nad carol
you did read that correctly<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:RadioThisIsFine:585896705040580624>
to go back to that discussion from a bit ago
satelight is owned by a pachinko parlor in case people didn't know
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
they also probably died
s1 design would have been superior if they actually grasped funimons designs <:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah just mute
so thats not that bad tbh
you have time to watch ep 12 before ep 13
new season starts 2-5 october usually 😛
final should be 28th september
yeah just missing ep 12
well ep 12 more like iirc
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
who says im going to share
so just got both
only got it bcs the LL magazine comes out on the same day
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
i have it ordered
solo sure likes his suffering
unless jp is really slow
leaks should be out before i get the magazine anyway
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
~~the guy who guesses it gets the song when the magazine arrives~~ except for solo bcs he knows
~~sailor moon has the best cape~~
its not shemha
its the perfect time to do it
will see that saturday
yeah smal lchanges
yeah s1 has 3 or 4 different ops
not outright replacing actual scenes and stuff
well they usually only did small changes
its not really eve explained
is it fully gona maybe
dimension closed
<:15min:495770478678638593>
shemha isnt a human
noise is a human invention
but would she
doubt it all exploded
we dont even know how  big it is
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
theyre called NR
we do
you have the xdu version for now <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
Fudou stockphrase is the famous samual L jacksan F word
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
```名優サミュエル・Ｌ・ジャクソンが、
作品や役の垣根を越えていつも連呼しているＦワードのようなもの。```
like predicted
she is ep 10 fodder
ABSOLUTE FUCKING UNIT
https://www.symphogear-xv.com/products/img/pkg_bd01@1.5x.jpg
lmao
did anyone expect something else
ep 9 are usually tsubasa episodes
also
as everyone should have expected
<:obama:439779824299540491>
we get all 3 dads in a single episode
https://symphogear-xv.com/next/XVnext09.php
AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
FUDOU FIGHTING
GEN FIGHTING
<:hyp:250363576005558272>
https://puu.sh/Ebk79.png
TOPDAD RETURNS
https://symphogear-xv.com/next/next09_kizunaomoubokuotousandayo/title.png
the face everyone wanted to see
its gonna be a pretty important basa episode
it wont even be a lull
if he has kids
yatsuhiro also probably
https://twitter.com/golden_nabe/status/1167362513370894336
god i love the episode already and it hasnt even aired
yes
they need shemha for the moon arc
they're on the website yea
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
so it was carol before the henshin
and dur da bla can only manifest when carol takes over
so just wait on a tl
the whole keyword explains it
yeah
yeah keywords drop thats she's essentially an AI
~~she's not real or resurrected~~
very interesting
the carol keyword is interesting
lmao
samual l jackson practically says F*ck in every movie
<a:15min:490152367631630346>
have you not seen samual l jackson movies?
id kwhats to explain about the fudou keyword tbh
its from Ono the director
read the interview btw AK
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they had to cut 20seconds
kiri henshin draft was 60secs
also
and gen fights
most however have topdad returns
too late
shirtless fudou is enough for me
idk
and a turning point for her
ono interview however confirms its a pretty important tsubasa episode
all the dads of gear in 1 episode
but boy am i excited for a dad episode
that was the obvious one to happen
well hero
https://symphogear-xv.com/keywords/key62.php
the samual jacksan reference is in the keyword itself
they need editing before being added
still in progress of adding s1 and G keywords though
https://wiki.poweris.moe/wiki/Category:Keyword for tls
that part is probably gonna be what topdad and bikki will talk about tbh
Ono
the director
they arent gonna spoil the remainder of the ep in an interview
well ofc
iirc it also mentioned that bikki can kill shem-ha but because its inhabiting the body of miku she cant punch
it was a pretty nice interview
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
but likely the former bcs >topdad
and topdad gonna reply something either actually stupid or say something genius
and probably gonna be about how bikki lost her sunshine
this is just an extension of said call
and bikki said in the phonecall to topdad she was gonna visit his apartment in ep2 iirc
but bikki shows time and time again thats not her character
not without having seen the ep at least tbh
i wouldnt call it dumb
pretty sure we have a bingo this ep
everything basa will be this ep
thats this episode neo
because they're terrible
that's why they're great tho AK
and they're terrible
every time
big brain
ayahi puns about ayahi
they are from looking at the animator list but as long they keep their current 1-2 episode directors its fine
its the only thing not finished at this point
the only delay that can happen is animation wise
<:hyp:250363576005558272>
~~new bathscene memorria in xdu soon~~
you hear the intro
https://puu.sh/Ebm6R.webm
it loops from henshin to ed
its practically most of the song
its what they used through the henshin
the intro is the henshin
haha
too lazy to listen to radio atm xd
do share
https://twitter.com/hiroyuki_taiga/status/1167377749423443968
which is eh pretty bad
so like they would have started 3months before the actual airing if it wasnt delayed
its the first thing they animated
they started the henshins 6months ago
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
they pushed back the whole thing for 3 months and glad they did
yeah xv originally was gonna start in spring season
they have HQ back but the amalgam ban is still in effect
the ban is still in place
punch her like you would punch me
yeah
bikki mentioned she was going to his apartment
they did
i also agree with mel on the prev line
yeah
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
at least they wont take damage if they do
they really didnt
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
unlock
and the rest will be final ep shenigans
i think it will just be basa and hibiki
nah
i wouldnt be surprised if basa unlocks the offensive mode next ep
honestly
no
yeah the drawback is that if you cant use it properly you're stuck in defense mode
<:thinkoshii:559465254338297857>
so she has to do stuff
maybe thats why topdad appears bcs gen actually gave her house arrest
she just did it ignoring the consequence like she always does
she wasn't allowed too
bikki couldnt use it bcs it was banned
<:15min:495770478678638593>
doggo girl bird
```it requires much more precise animation, choreography and planning```

i would agree to disagree with that statement
<:nani:241228065357824001>
the last paragraph on that ono interview explains some things about tsubasa
<:harold:364119409620418591>
not very threatening anymore
considering the screenshots show them in song base
different animators for different jobs
theyre stock animation
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
and is also pretty good cheorography
with the strings and such
talking about strictly carol fight? because she had the more precise moments
carol is confirmed to be an AI
no thats carol confirmed
noise are noise
bikkis dad
what wfc said
i believe in the kaneko of XV
they really dont
people get too mad at an image of topdad
relax
in fanart it is
can we not go there
you're really bad with shortened versions arnt you
kerrik please
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they managed to cut broadcast before basa henshin in G at least
and maria also i gues bcs its in the same scene
<:15min:495770478678638593>
did they get everyone to sign an NDA
everyone saw bikki tho
the only thing they could do is re-adapt the last few chapters but thats about it
there isnt actually anything else adaptable for agk <:15min:495770478678638593>
mine doesnt arrive till monday
jsut had to ninja in finding someone that had the marker
its from the AR marker that came with the megumi magazine release
👌
its also shitty 160kb/s but its th best you will get till bd
~~we have full song, will link after im done with this movie~~
||https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558551287344660490/617402800581771365/unknown.png||
just watch the ep when it comes out
please
stop doing that
at the console
yes
before and after message
||
||dead||
||basa amalgam offense unlocked||
||SSJ Fause Robe|| official name
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
hence she was at topdad
also called it how bikki was gonna have house arrest
likely she's doing something
fucking up between axz and xv
so the same problem as last week
and fightign scenes
bcs the good segments are the important ones
still good enough for gear standards
its the usual drop
it actually showcases how alike bikki and akira are if anything
||https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/407203682216706070/617414166206218273/mpv_Ohys-Raws_Senki_Zesshou_Symphogear_XV_-_09_BS11_1280x720_x264_AAC.mp4_001016.147.png?width=1226&height=690||
this frame to be precise
when using her gear
lmao
they forgot to animate maria's underwear so she looks naked at one point
~~also dont forget this is gear and NR might return~~
and vanessa did research it before she got into the explosion
it should be one of the top brass of the illuminati
there isnt much choice
well
if fudou means her with she has been long gone then yes
a suit isnt gonna help you against a noise attack
how would they arm them better
she really doesnt
ep 2 and 3 then
first  3 eps is all jii and kirika
have you been watching the first 3 eps?
the seal shattered
it broke after the slap
her hands also got sliced
millaarc is in 4 pieces
10 bucks elsa and millaarc return
nah
vampires regenerate
but we have like a vampire
elsa is the biggest doubt
same
no joke tho
<:kappa:281531248634232842>
they have shards
so its just a katana
its not active
but a disactivated one
well its a relic sure
and smol bikki is the cutest thing ever
topdad was sort of hot when he was younger though
they were exactly how they need to be
and all of their best units probably already died in previous accidents <:15min:495770478678638593>
and guns are effective againse alca noise
nor is body armor
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
NR
he'll just escape
put him in jail?
and then what
and run away with the control
should have kept it on and let gears deal with fudou
well its NRs fault for disabling the direct feedback system
"fine"
more then half of the secret agents died
well a bit more
a side char
this is the death you'll get
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
into the ground
through a rock
fudou pushed both him and gen through that rock
same for grandad on that matter
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
cleared to be used
just on time
well we have like 12 noble reds now
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
2 is better then 1
<:15min:495770478678638593>
we have 2 gens then
whats to lose
she's very skilled at a sword you could say
basa stopped it
<:MariaHappy:236871184807886848>
also we got more shem-ha in her black dress
Kaze no Anata ni likely refers to Yatsuhiro
~~and we do now know why basa cd is delayed~~
and let's not forget basa summoned the Shichishitō as amalgam
depending on which historical story you read
werewolfs have as much if not more regen powers then vampires you know
its clear as a day
she didnt went into shock bcs of the moon or something
bcs fudou was using his direct bullshit system cypher
its the direct feedback system that caused it
yeah jsut rewatched the part of miku looking at the moon
they had fragments of ssj all around shemha bracer
a hidden secret
same as alca noise
FG is an illuminati only thing
ver doesnt have access to that
its only possible if someone also made a faust robe with part of the relic in question
and no shues
the system was acting up just before
yeah
its like standard japanese housing
its an apartment building
not even a house
yes roak
yeah its the second time
or axz
in gx also i think
its not the first time it happened
yes, yes they did
<:15min:495770478678638593>
GX is also the show that makes bikki act out of character
cheer up each other like how dorks do it
and to show that bikki and akira are the same
the point of those scenes was essentially this
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1167898942828204032
they reused our best guy adams main soundtrack
im just sad they didnt gave gen vs fudou a new ost
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
unlike bikki
that tie sure defies gravity and such
he didnt really job tbh
everyone at FIS orphany was a possible fine candidate
<:15min:495770478678638593>
shemha might have killed NR but miku might revive NR
don't forget they have a literal asspull free right now
<:15min:241820657027907584>
give it an ep or 2 time and bam NR
and they didnt get closure yet
and theyre a central theme to the story according to kaneko interview
they will still be back bcs this is gear we watch
they havent gotten closure yet
they will be back
opening killed me inside
but god bless something finally went wrong in his plans
he did mention if i cant become a monster then you will become a monster  if you kill me
maybe he gives up bcs basa didnt kill him
but he's actually gonna stop him?
he would be yes
though if fudou escaped he can still reactivate it
thanks NR
its actually still in the top trends
https://puu.sh/EbTod.png
on jp twitter
OTONA was the trending word
it was trending
while silver-mercury amalgam are used for teeth filling by dentists
gold-mercury based amalgam is used to get gold out of ore
it would be weird if they arent mostly gold tbh
makes sense for fudou top have it tbh
its one of the 3 sacrist relics
its clearly the murakumo
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://twitter.com/zoidzero1/status/1167909812870320128
makes me wonder if other amalgams will also take a reference to X historical relic
yes
they can move
they turned
nah
<:Ver:244664866529345537>

let me find it
there's actually a shot of fudou that resembles ver pretty hard
in how they act
pretty much
lmao
long gone could just refer to him thinking they have been killed with the poisoned blood yea
....
vanessa worked on fg
solo
dont take that literaly
i doubt fudou is action movie watcher tbh
yatsuhiro dying is the biggest one you will get
no girl is going to take the bullet
in one way or another
they'll be back
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/558551287344660490/617480690128388106/unknown.png
they'll boot him out of japan
G> s1=AXZ> GX
something gear actually could learn from
has some pretty well thought out cliffhanger bombs
this is not the discussion channel for it but its worth trying
<a:15min:490152513623031809>
yep
but thats about it for shows im watching in terms of cliffhanger this season
granbelm comes pretty close this season
thats watching gear weekly pretty much
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
he's jacked but not as buffed as he is later on
havent seen one yet
well all seasons got licensed
but god were the scenes good
yeah we didnt had a lot of kamimiku
????
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
the pharaoh was pretty great
and where they explain philological weapons
AXZ
it was supposed to come out way earlier
then again they delayed AXZ in xdu
6months to a year after XV ends
theyre def not normal humans for the most part
who needs blood when you have shemha
because XV is still airing
ye but it wasn't fully operational yet anyway
they dont have the time to give each girl amalgam offensive mode solo
or any other annuaki really
the mummy at the start is also probably someone who shemha took control of
it takes control of the hosts body
it just looks like a parasite tbh
but back to shemha
a divine being
what i mean was that ver was only able to control the frontier bcs of the nephilim
moons active again <:15min:495770478678638593>
she fucked up
that wasnt just a press either
just look at ver in G at the frontier
its not that easy
the guy who activated the curse isnt just a random follower
i wouldnt say not important
thats enki
NR stole the bracelet
america got the mummy
no
i wouldnt be surprised if its the same as miku
the mummy at the end?
an annuaki
the being inside the bracelet i guess
shemha and miku divine power are unrelated
it has that direct feedback system build in
the faust robe was a tool to control shemn ha
it wasnt?
adam doesnt care about the robes
the only other person we know in the series that dabbled into Faust robe technology was vanessa
+ a shadow
its the same colour as her skin
its really not there
so it doesnt really add up
but if they're fighting shemha there is no reason to only have 1 more amalgam offense unlocked
1 ep chris
1 ep maria
1ep zababa
well technically they could?
elsa got exactly cut at her hands
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
elsa hands
millaarc lower
vanessa upper
NR gattai
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
it says so in the title btw
its basa suffering pics
worked for me
i see your pp
~~next ep clearly~~
they sing the damn same refrains
it will be coming
twin hearts is a duet
elza figured out the strat
fudou told them to do it
cocnert is probably the same
yeah
get divine power kill shem ha
adam was pretty straight forward
only got foiled by a annuaki in the end
they wanted to include more auto's but didnt had the time for it
i dont think its the autos
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
probably all of them
yea
as long as he can use them in their positions of power yes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
maybe one of the unnamed brothers
which at this point is probably everyone
he does care about kazanari's when they dont let him down <:15min:495770478678638593>
"cause a distraction"
you still need to figure out how to get the noise to work as explosions at the precise places to bring the building down
today was a picture of nana song session
its pictures with some small text
geah twitter is gonna post behind the scenes stuff starting from september
that reminds me
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
didnt even see that emoji
unusual for anime though
yeah it just says dubbing is done
the only newbie va
elsa is kana ichinose
mao is vanessa ye
so millaarc
its aimi
wait
vanessa
or well teach elfnein how to do it <a:15min:490152367631630346>
she just fixed up the pendants and that was it
sg could have done the same for that matter but she didnt
they build it up since ep 2
NR was always going to sabotage fudou
never forget that you are watching symphogear <:15min:495770478678638593>
its not because fudou is done with them that they are done in the story
telling the same backstory 3 times would have been unnecessary
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
you could say that for a lot of shows
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but they still dont understand
so they had to make a show where people would understand
axz is the result of people not understanding gear <a:15min:490152482429861898>
makes adlib easier also
and thats only because they dub before they finish animation
<:harold:364119409620418591>
at least dubbing is the one part that usually doesnt get much delays
you could do it sooner on purely rough drafts tho
depending on their schedule yeah
too much backlog <:15min:495770478678638593>
but louis probably wants to focus on the lives first after xv or something
but s1-s3 might get the same treatment, edit commie and make a batch release
still need to actually batch that tho
well we're monday so saturday is soon
eh doubt it tbh
Best you'll get that's not the live

it's only like a min long or so
there's an xdu rip
```Didn't that info just help with speeding up the process of cleansing?```
yeah
its sg who told 119 how to fix it with  the philo stone
elf9 cleaning didnt fix the issue
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
obv bcs its born from bikki
axz trio fausts were powered by the philo
it cancels out the philo stone
its just like durandal vs neph really
<:genocide:612329552814931968>
https://nyaa.si/view/1173372
kaliks posted the mp3 torrent i think
they did say spoiler warning <:15min:495770478678638593>

<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
> Melaarc
it is voyeur
this week anime is just dorks talking about shows that dont really get reviews on ANN
<:15min:495770478678638593>
just before it is even worse
``` It's also a bizarre production fluke that started mostly to promote Nana Mizuki's music career nearly a decade ago, ```
did you stop there
yeah
they all were in it together yeah

https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/1169068714903375874
the writer at least watches gear <:15min:495770478678638593>
its not actually bad
song lyrics should be ignore imo
the use maria to repopulate the earth in G
yea it wasnt needed in axz
who do get referenced a lot
kaneko is a bigger fan of older movies
def before next ep <:15min:495770478678638593>
they were talking about the encode yesterday so it shouldnt be that far off
the styling on the other hand sucks pretty hard this for XV
commie song editing is pretty good though
geah is one of the only ones they do thats usually otl
dw they usually do edit for most of their shows
like on xv 6 and 7
commie geah is otl except when vale is on vacation
is vale still on vacation 🤔
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
still wish geah was inhouse tl but thats not gonna happen
tld by someone from mages. that doesnt watch gear
most of the mistakes in crs gear is because its eh
tling song from ear is pretty hard
till the cd comes out with the lyrics sheet
song lyrics are usually trash in any fabsub also
doesnt mean she didnt read it beforhand or something
she isnt using it at all
she overwrote mikus mind
miku is probably smart enough to put 1 and 1 together
to melua
not the miku memory htings
that was a response above
she doesnt have to use her memories
she was in AXZ
probably
eh
she read mikus memories?
why would shemha care about kanade in the first place
better then fudou releasing a god onto the world
yep
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but it wasn functional yet and NR disabled it
well the feedback system could be mind control
she's a god so she probably could
that and its harder to hit someone you love
not kanade the gear user
all miku knows is kanade of zwei wing
but i still fail to see why she would res kanade <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
doesnt post the cg after that
its maikyu ichival itself fuck
or at least i think it was <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
bar kat the moon is in xdu so easy to check
hold on
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i just want to to read his opinion
def
god i want to know what blog it is
```Also, there seems to be too much sweet-talk here about how good the 5th season is, but there is a blog I do follow that mentions how incredibly crap this season is, such as how incredibly nonthreatening the villains are, and the fact that Miku being brainwashed? Rehashed from season 2. ```

<:15min:495770478678638593>
im still waiting on a reply for that one guy on ANN
whoever added it did the same as what i did
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
ah yes
Enclosed with Senkizesshou Symphogear Blu-ray BOX Limited Edition (KIXA-90737~9).
now its correct
<:15min:495770478678638593>
which is actually wrong
~~i cheated and looked at the boxset credits for the ost~~
bark at hte moon was arranged by hitoshi fujima
https://twitter.com/symphogear_XD/status/1169882929704644608
its on xdu twitter
i made it with a minute left before 11 but now intern is asleep
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
and here i went to barber and hoped i would be back on time
someone is asleep
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
well ver got mentioned in the keywords at least
but do it wrongly
well geah has a habit of fucking over the people who mean right
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
its my parasite theory after all
also expected
and what the long gone was refering to
as i expected
but that maria screenshot is def millaarc arm
its probably a fusion of all 3 or it could be them apart
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
read the comment on the yatty screenshot
AK
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
with millaarc arms
thats just gonna be NR gattai really
<a:15min:490152482429861898>
well i guess that NR gattai is gonna be a thing
its her purple from her arm
that maria screenshot looks like millaarc
eh
the jobber we all love
maria finally gonna be back to normal
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
bcs maria jobbed
thsi weeks interview is with nana btw
not even talking about ww and such
considering all the trades with germany and japan in geah
that its a german gun that is
which actually makes sense
Mauser C96
german
again
that update on miku killed me inside
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
i cant help but read c96 as comiket 96
i hate how the gun is called blabla C96
<:15min:495770478678638593>
nono its "faust robe"not faust robe
of all things
that gun keyword tho
"faust robe"
and keywords confirm it
he was cypher
so they are long gone
which refers to him thinking that he kileld NR
they will be later
its not actually combat focused
its ahackjob of thigns vanessa put together to control miku
its not an actual faust robe per se
hes als othe one who created it
its what his line in the keyword refers towards
remember
ver made the direct feedback system
so its all gonna be fine
its in the faust robe ssj keyword
it is a god
shem ha is the actual only god
maybe an apostle
its likely bcs divine power in axz was divine power with no name
nah
he cant control shem ha but he can control the body
yeah
these are keywords from last week anyway
we will know tomorrow
it should have happened but it didnt
it think the key here is /should/ have been
```Angels of the Shem Hamephorash```
🤔
we will find out tomorrow
shem ha reshaping NR as a golem makes sense
the story of shem ha has a golem
either way is fine for me really
that still means millaarc is alive tho
perhaps
~~like what i said~~
ye
from solo's link
meaning the explicit name, is an originally Tannaitic term describing a hidden name of God in Kabbalah (including Christian and Hermetic variants), and in some more mainstream Jewish discourses.
what we are trying to say is that shem ha in literal history is a hidden name of god
poor adam
webdev has too much fun with alt text
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
```You drank too much wine, father...```
and for the people who dont know
the webdev text for the yatsu picture says
they would pull this
and yet its also geah  solo
welcome to half an hour ago
you can live with 1 lung anyway
+ that
him not being dead wouldnt come as surprising
the gunwound is at the wrong side of the heart
training montage perhaps
nobody is
<:15min:495770478678638593>
you dont touch the wiki till xv is over
to be precise
or Adam wouldn't have been in such a rush to destroy what's inside
it would have still opened over time
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
it was never explained what exactly they are though
and a lucky shot
the coffin opened itself
americans didn't do something wrong in that case tho
human would go extinct if fine destroyed the moon
no not really
well
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
Adam ruling the world but being alive still sounds better then shemha ruling the world and destroying everything
i still need my sides
solo please
cypher please
training montage <a:15min:585535690817798150>
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
and zed is adam
exactly
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
wrong
my sides
sora please
well brb now
so did sg
so did fine
<a:15min:490152513623031809>
its gear
its gonna happen
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
yeah its not "murakumo"but its a murakumo
where the director only started the storyboards for the final ep when they were working on ep 9 or ep 10
shirobako actually shows that really well
the one above about basa
now that it matters tbh
they did it both together
only ingame now <:15min:495770478678638593>
they stopped putting them on the blog
yeah
pretty sure the xdu blog isnt updated
but an actual place for all the comics? not sure if we have one
all of the ones tld are on ytt twitter
the best kind of sol to watch after a stupid day at work <:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
its sol but with an extraoomph
ishiyakei ```"the term is used to refer to anything (an artwork, a piece of music, a person, even a scenic view) that creates a sense of peace and spiritual satisfaction. It serves as an emotional refreshment for the stress- filled viewer in need of such an antidote to modern life."```
sol shows with Mono no aware are ishiyakei
yep
but not every sol is an ishiyakei
they go hand in hands
other way around
not every sol is an ishiyakei
its not the same
i like sol but my favourite is still ishiyakei
11 i think
it was <:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
gx is the clear end with our last action hero
cypher please
<:15min:495770478678638593>
Adam also suffered from setting up xv
could have used some more screentime tho
he was fine
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
last few eps
breather ep in geah
yes
||welcome to space||
thats a vanessa attack 🤣
it was <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
shemha revived them as full monsters
no not yet
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
oh hey look NR
depending o nthe order of eps they did it might turn out the same or worse
but we're also closing into end of the season so yeah
a bit worse then usual tbh
sacrifices had to be made to draw fudou in an 8pack
more like
more like a walking swiss army knife
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i see you upgraded the pic to 5tails
which is a normal thing to happen towards the end of a shows runtime
it had its fair share of errors yeah
should be up any minute
<:15min:495770478678638593>
its NR redemption time
they wont
let alone a geah user
they didnt even kill of NR
its not possible
its not
the x gear user must die is tiring as its never gonna happen
the raw just aired
all of them got teleported though
maybe it will elsa that help vanessa to tip
elza gonna be pretty easy, just look at this ep
hence she's gonna be the hardest one to convince
yeah she lost all of her reason
vanessa is gonna be the hardest one  to redeem with bikki
<:15min:495770478678638593>
her sword is long enough to behead 2 people at once
we are
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
some people thought she was gonna behead millaarc
she had an attack card fudou messed around with just before that
her amalgam attack gets interrupted by gen
she doesnt
the firts amalgam attack card is zababa yes
depends if you include final attacks or not
real shem-ha is also a pretty looker
she used it herself perhaps
instead of tucked inside her gear
i like that jii's hair is lose
and basa missing out on it
the worst part is not seeing yatsu funeral
not knowing it was an attack name
mages probably just saw the name in the script and took it literally
its literal tl for every kanji that shows up
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/558551287344660490/619969272420106269/unknown.png
but please dont use the name CR gave it
its a giant bear trap
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
yeah
no gear matches zababa yeah
well its zababa unison in amalgam
and probably bcs belldandy is also a literal goddess solo
and yugioh also
yeah that still reminds me of belldandy
third time was almost the charm
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
which means dinosaurs <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
she wants to go back to pre-historic
can we let shemha succeed
actually
actually reminded me of belldandy
with the face reveal of how shem ha actually looks i wouldnt be surprised if she gets her complete body, copy paste btw, and then boots out miku
you actually would leave it untld
no
its a side effect from all that jobbing
maria is pretty sturdy
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
return to prehistoric earth
geahs on the moon so they arent caught up in it
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
not that i actually remember yubel
like half and half
theres clear female and male bodyparts in that
it actualyl looks like both tbh
doesnt look like it tbh
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/villains/images/7/74/Yubel-TF04-JP-VG.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20170923012149
he looks like one <:15min:495770478678638593>
wasnt yubel a guy
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
Ono did yugioh before
well
we have a relic thats part made out of yddrygassil
it solves like every problem
copy paste sure is strong i nthe world of geah
copy paste
she's doing
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bcs you can just pun words with meow and remove the verbal tick
nya is the best verbal tick
pretty sure we use "yeah" <:15min:495770478678638593>
but yes is actually a fine tl for dess
she used outerworld physics to turn them into silver yeah
considering it did the reverse
or shemha rebelled
melua pls
or enki wouldnt really had any reason to activate
they were clearly fighting before
<:15min:495770478678638593>
before enki activated the curse
how would breaking the curse bring world peace when humanity speaking the same language was the cause for wars in the first place
it was still vers datachip
not that its wrong what sorano said though
yeah she blatantly says it
its not mill alone
NR rivaled that
ye
they made a point of it
they did guard her
we should be precise if we want to blame people <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
well its actually mages.
no
that doesnt matter though
and america just used it for heretical technology which they probably dont even wanted to share
they dont really had any reason to care about ssj
ssj isnt a symphogear anymore
wouldnt matter even
its not
doubt they actually wanted to share all of their data
except when noise happened
they were with geah users the whole time
well
gen can't disobey an official order
its not
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
well that is until bikki
<:smug:239129154061205505>
how could you have missed the biggest shit G dropped
<:15min:495770478678638593>
spirits are souls
and they mention it again in xv
in G....
the last you heard from soul rending was back in G
they never bothered mention it in gx and axz
well maybe its gonna play a role
considering they brought up kiri scythe again this season
its supposed to be yes
because they dont understand how to do it
the sakurai theory and all surrounding was released for the public
dont even need to steal it
but that data was public since s1 anyway
or krika i guess
tag solo for that
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
theyres probably anon tls somewhere though
and zoid mentioned he didnt go on the internet for 24hs to keep himself in the dark for the ep so he didnt do them either
we didnt do them yet
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
image for ants tho
https://images-ext-1.discordapp.net/external/-s5oRhYRgwNwXadWGUlZ8gPtSlfBcmepq3eggLD4K_s/https/i.4cdn.org/a/1567886146586.jpg?width=544&height=689
yeah same
<:15min:495770478678638593>
keeping jp words in english is bad practice
its why we use climax song
superb is the official one but it just reads bad
it makes sense on ep 1 s1 yeah but not in every other single instance
swan song implies things it doesnt even do
<:smug:239129154061205505>
they would have done that before
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
maybe next ep
we actually expected live announcement this ep
yeah
like jc staff has 4 anime this season and they're only animating 1 show of the 4
they arent jc staff this season <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
well geah generally doesnt outsource the whole ep at least
well every ep outsourced stuff
i took a quick look at credits for ep 10 and there isnt that much difference compared to previous ep credits
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the misaligned adam arm is still a thing in the bds
but they also forget to fix other ones
they do
one of them didnt had the handle colored correctly
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but they had miscolors since segway noise
those are yeah
when they look shobby
far away shots arent animation errors tho
"budget"
~~just tweet it to the director~~
with the help of the other gears
she will
eh
there isnt as much to do as you think there is
first result
from: Millhi#0393 in: xv-discussion has: link
somewhere up above
fgo has more money to spend
rie doesnt fit
fudou was never gonna be endgame tho
i can see them getting a diff va for it tbh
yeah
yeah iguchi is killing it with shemha voice
her body it looked like
yea
just needs to finish copypasting her real body
she's probably gonna ditch miku body soon enough
yeah
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
~~the Yggdrasil fragment from gungnir resonates with Yggdrasil tower causing bikki to fire a big bang at the moon~~
yes
thats a given
must be fun playing ping pong with braincells against kiri
<:15min:495770478678638593>
jii def had the braincells that moment
jii makes a good counterpoint on that at least
solo please
that scene was sort of sad but they ruined it with the army knife
tbh
yep
as full monsters
she resurrected them
"well i guess NR jobbing was real""
perfect match
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
gotta go frieza all the way\
perfect
Ryūsei Nakao
i know who
i found it
i found it
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
the easiest would keep yukachi tho
Megumi Hayashibara would also fit
same
same
oh god
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
she would have been perfect
too bad sawashiro already voiced fine
doable but only if she doesnt use her regular voice tick
needs someone that can do a colder voice
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
yes
she wants to revert to 5000 years ago
is the same thing they did with adams arm in axz
like that error
i laughed
dammit
<:15min:495770478678638593>
its supposed to be at the edge but it isnt
the yoyo is misaligned
ah yes

<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
YTT has the best name for it
<:15min:495770478678638593>
big doubt
well seeing as they havent released the fine/carol memoria yet
not go back 5k in time
she wants to revert the world back to 5k ago
overuse power to do something big and left without much power
its the same thing they pulled with adam
all 3 of them are in it together
why only millaarc
even if its not exactly made for combat
technically she should be able to use the faust robe of ssj
thats where the shemha leaves miku's body to get into her own body comes into play
there's gonna be a convenient teleporter dw
179~
I'm around cag height
fucking genes
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
and my niece towers at 2m
my mom and sis don't reach 160cm either
not like every european is big
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
found the noise
171 for men
158cm average
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
according to studies back in 2008
the optimally desired waist measurement for japanese women is 58 cm
for Japan women that is
58 isn't impossible tho

it's just a throw away line in axz
it would have been more interesting if they had done more with it tbh
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
yeah
it was just to introduce philosophical weapons really
song responding to natural disasters sounds fun tbh
axz was more impressive animation wise but nothing beats slicing a mountain and a shuttle suplex
mainly bcs of Philo vs fools stone
no
bo
if ignite still existed?
<:15min:495770478678638593>
dun forget
she's getting her own anime
she is
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
and probably a noise
if nana helped design Vanessa it would have been a samurai and stick figure
<:15min:495770478678638593>
she only did semi-well bcs shemha used up her power for summoning the tree
🤔
aren't nephilim depending on what text you're gonna read offspring from the "Sons of God" and "daughters of men" or giants or fallen angels

basa new xdu song beats defenderZ so hard
eh
dmjii gay or miku gay in songs are still worlds apart
but yeah dmjii is also pretty blatant
miku has that extra touch with her songs
dmjii is in your face but songs or stuff aren't about the gay
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
singing about how gay she is for bikki
miku's xdu song

they wanted a new noise design
series director created them
~~someone should edit the gif to say symphonoise~~
toei has it
pa works has their own

most studio's are there
theyre located in the animation ward so to speak
<:smug:239129154061205505>
the studio is just a floor they hire in a building

<:LUL:243896110001684480>
bikki maybe
basa, miku, elza
there's gonna be all sort of suffering
kasumeme=millaarc <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
as long as its basa or maria
either one is fine
<:15min:495770478678638593>
thats bcs they need to be able to show henshins again to win time
doubt
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
well with that reasoning bikki should watch out not to punch through the wall then
NR was never gonna be killed
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
start of the ep was clearly Wild Arms
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
you're in the right channel
you can spoil tho
nah
maria saying the exact same line to basa from G was icing on the cake
aaah
do you mean the adam theme  creme?
yes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
just like the curse intended
yeah she is
enki keeps apologizing to fine tho
she jsut used a piece of the enki arm relic to make argetlahm
fine also made it tho
its only a shard of it that maria uses
or try to at least
we do all sorts of symphogear things
maybe if i commission the person again LMAO
```I can imagine doctor ver in shem ha dress :classbLul:
```
good thing i already commissioned somethign with miku or i would have done that
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
hence the speedo
they cant do that
missed chance
i wanted speedo adam
she's only available as an enemy <:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
http://i.imgur.com/qk1w4JR.jpg
they shouldnt but i just want an excuse to post this again
<:harold:364119409620418591>
actual *last* action hero
yeah
except ver
it actually looked like the scorpion tail to me (the one running over the brace in the OP) but that might just be me
chris falling and bouncing off her boobs was funny
and
oh
yeah the arm should actually still be alive afaik
but not at current time in the series
on a flash back
he would have fit early in the show
eh
no
before it
https://puu.sh/EhcF0.png
yeah that
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/558551287344660490/622523886394933261/KqjaoUf_TrY.png
yeah
<:JustFine:256624508025307137>
open bat and shit
g gundam references
cant complaign tho
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
hopefully she does the pose
yeah
but yeah its her
solo got that from me
yes
it would have appeared anyway
it was gonna happen either way yeah
he didnt
in that mechanism
yeah
he was the reason why they even found out about it
~~macross delta~~
pretty soundproof
now that carol is back
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
but rather now when theres gears
started in 08 ended in 16
2008
damn
>aimi is already 8 years a va
aimi
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
crazy right
yeah she's just wearing a shard from an arm
its bcs she's literally wearing enki's arm
then that wouldnt make much sense
if it was in all humans
her consciousness imo
her copy /paste was in the vambrace
it now does in XV
the adam line didnt make sense in AXZ
what adam was saying on that line iirc
not actually terminals
軍隊 (army) or 群体 (colony)
it was bcs of eh
it might be a 10min one tbh
we might get some more tbh
no
gotta collect all the aufwachen
yeah same
those always have the aufwachen music
thats a personal nana album
nah
nana album

~~snake eyes~~
and shirabe fine
someone on twitter noted that shem-ha has the same eye outline as fine
so thats likely
its not gonna be a complicated reason
and leave it up to the viewer
i can see them actually skipping that
the enki and shemha fight was also nice bcs every big explosion had like a few impact frames
smear frames are great
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
he cut of his arm to stop the silver transmutation
and tbh Enki looked just smarter then her
~~while also going overbudget on the movie~~
~~but god do i hate the production committee system so much~~
~~make one of the best selling late night anime movies ever (2 billion yen+) but dont get a single penny because actas wasn't on the committee~~
this was god vs god
she would be against gears
not exactly a fight
it was throwing some beams and fuck off
yeah
well actas would have went bankrupt on gup if it wasnt for bandai
the best part is that he's actively updating it after every ep
the front is open for everyone to see solo <a:15min:490152416751386624>
there's small differences on the xdrive designs but mainly underwear stuff
it appeared itself from down deep
thats only the coords
they didnt
she just appears in shemha again
you kill 1 shemha
shemha is in every dna of every human
coffin would still have appeared
not just that, there wouldnt have been a way to remove shem-ha
esp with the phoenix fire right after
yeah but it was such a good fit
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
shemha, shemha old, miku, shemha miku duet
yeah theres nothing on last 2 volumes
around 4 for XV probably yeah
im still expecting NR song
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
oh you mean 6 gears + NR
:bigthink:
>9
a movie is a possibility bcs it doesnt fall into the final season thing
they will be
<a:BikkiRoach:397475944782233600>
froppy or me
wat to what
tfw axz antho actually has a carol x elfnein chapter
yeah the others are anthology works
and theres sympho manga but not in the west
its on BD also so
but the whole site not updating is another one
no prev pics is one thing
it could still happen
and the earth is being restructured
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bcs the gears are on the moon
that line is just referring to ep11 ye
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
man can't believe genjuuro can use wires
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<@139432096023183360>  check the interview and the kanji that sums up symphogear according to hikasa
bikki destroys earth and miku recreates it
some shows long gone still have a special place in my heart tho <:15min:495770478678638593>
there's been a lot of pls bring geah to the West but like half of them won't even buy the show
if enough people buy for sure
as long as it shits out cash like it does now yeah it will
bikki never solo'd the  final boss which was what im saying
its stupid but its still them helping out bikki
so they couldnt do anything
bcs they gave their power to bikki
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
<:15min:495770478678638593>
thanks
so they helped bikki make it possible
she always dealt the final punch but it was never alone
bikki never defeated a villain alone
the trio is in the shinais
they were
previews are a thing <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
fucking ||ogawa's brothers||
people who don't play xdu will miss out the best part
and lol
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
S1 tagline
||falling, burning, and disappearing, then...||
they did it, or well shemha did
this ep is <:PogChamp:259351889932451841>
its fate detective now
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
in an hour

they zesshod
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
movie
falling, burning, and disappearing, then...
S1 tagline
ye
but ye ogawa brothers appeared in xdu before
how did they fuck up the tagline
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
and its a wild arms reference
a bow actually makes sense tbh
movie can still happen
considering they really promoted this as the final tv season i doubt they'll make another one
the extra hair is pretty visible on kirika
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bikki ass not following gravity tho
pretty scarf
her scarf is red yes
she really wasn't pure
that's burning
they all grew extra hair
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
>not expecting NR to bullshit something so they get a song in ep 13
who was actually cut short the first time
better then basa amalgam
it was fine imo
it's just kaneko channeling his inner wild arms
is her amalgam
https://wildarms.fandom.com/wiki/De_Le_Metalica
ive been screaming since ep 1 tbh
just play xdu for pimp bro
<:15min:495770478678638593>
it's called pajeets
yeah there is
her brain still is
she was still a human before
yeah
basa is the worst
Chris is actually good
pimp ogawa
zenki Zesshou is a bad tl
yes
so i doubt they won't for xv
they always played bikki bside
kimi can still be sang next week
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
he works at a host club
she tried her best
she can't do more
ye
she can damage her but she will just heal

<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
you mean pajeets helped
>Trump helped
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
meto ed
also lastig song op
😂
they'll befriend shemha
they won't
it's just a stall moment
there's literally nothing she could have done
there was nothing wrong with it
i could see that happen
only bikki can wound her
it's why carol did plan B and sang to kickstart xdrive for the geahs
with bikki it might work
the geahs were singing without bikki trying to activate the chatteau
actually
<:BERSERKBU:497710764144984064>
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
ofc the bad tl gets posted everywhere
you guys were just too much into the chris amalgam must be gundam
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
it's her scarf but ye that shot does reminds of sg

you're like the fourth person i know that's moving on sympho finale
is next week general moving day?
it's not ss
jbig difference
it's a Faust robe
<:Yousoro7:356677867305697280>
above 70k according to the news
we know the kill count but not the survive count iirc
they're just there to show the hacking
they arent important
in both xdu and keywords yes
they still are
they were
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
5 seasons late rand people still dont get sympogear
NR was fine
or mecha in general
i dont remember most of the gundam
<:Pogchamp:373682786856337419>
and then i was like yeah gundam
it actuallt remidned me at first of the nova in freezing
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
more eps wont really fix it
but they never knew beforehand
if they actually know they had 64 eps to work with they could have written accordingly
its just a matter of spreading out
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
we want mor eps
>geah had 64 eps
no
they dont really need more
and lock ssj again for miku to only use in actual emergencies
they had to write out ssj at the end of xd event
not that
actually like it
faust robe was a pretty good alternative tbh
the problem is that theres no gear left or they would have to bullshit one out
they arent worth it
phogi dont bother
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
i cant believe this
LUL
🤔
how do i explain this to you
they both got announced but they didnt get written at the same time
if you give geah more eps they would literally end up wasting eps doing nothing and not moving things forward
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
imagine it happening 100 years later with no gears
it acelerated the plans
its actually good the gears went there anyway
i reckon that was just to melt the ice
it would have opened anyway if they left it alone
it was literally bcs of global warning
he wasnt leaving
nothing more
tiki just showed the coordinates
it would have still happened
it only accelerated it
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
killing off shemha
adam was through and through bad but with the actual good plan
yeah
but had the good intentions
he was a bad guy
with shemha having the upperhand in every possible way
it would have always been a stalemate
she can damage her but she will just reset
id kwhat you want from carol when she cant actually touch a god
carol was actually trying to hurt her
maria went easy on shemha
she didnt went easy
way better then how they wrote him in GX
topdad actually doing good things is nice tbh
:topdad:
<:15min:495770478678638593>
its not even a correct tl
even if ver himself is dead
but ver took in nephilim which would still be alive
the huge chunk of nephilim is destroyed
its still on earth afaik
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
neph would have eaten the relics for shemha
nah
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
we are currently about a what if krika
or we would have gotten bikki durandal everything
its better this way tho
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
geah would have been so different if fine knew
it was all bcs of a misunderstanding
i still feel bad for fine
i dont have an answer to that
rofl
lmao
when geah throws actual more bs at us
i still cant believe you want to talk about this
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
i used this so muc htoday
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
what
seriosuly
```their AXZ arc means nothing now
honestly I'm annoyed at that```
what
usually its playing ping pong between jii nad kiri
shirabe is only smart when she has the 2 braincells
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i would have like millaarc chibi as a pet
<:AinyaGasm:356682640494952458>
as you said this is geah so miku will be 100% alive and kicking at the end
well charles
~~we already got hibimiku~~
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
his os also died
it's just cr being cr
it's a goof
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
or gen
why let ogawa fight when you could watch 6 gears jobbing
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
enki prequel is in his keyword
and pimp ogawa recently got shown in xdu
they were mentioned in keywords back in G
each bd has like 2 songs
bd 5 and bd 6
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
4 more
we still need more songs for the bds
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
its not over yet
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
when next week
yeah
it's the first
worth it
good ping
lmao
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i got you guys covered dw
<:15min:495770478678638593>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
so what can you do
well its not
not again
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
prev seasons had 2 songs per bd
its a guess
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
there's always ep13 to do some bs at least
and once again they didnt
they had the chance to let bikki do what she wanted to do in axz (and other seasons)
they shouldnt have faded away in the first place
he probably means the new cap for XV
beat up shemha
tfw xdu spoiled us pimp bro
its not even on life support yet
fudou realizing that basa can protect with her song
what i said above
basa/fudou arc isn't done yet
Basa showing him that her song can protect japan/the world
he'll probably get a scene tho
you thought it was me shemha but it was I ~~Dio~~ Fudou
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
he still can bs in ep 13
dw
keyword makes it sound like its not mutakumo
meteorites would be able to pass
actually just changing placement to the left or right would be enough
the moon doesn't even need to crash into earth to kill humanity
it's not a slingshot
in either option humanity dies tho
it would move away from earth
so the moon can't actually crash into earth
the explosion was towards the earth
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
bikki friends shemha and she just fucks off
but i wouldn't be surprised if they take the route that everyone will hate
after it destroyed buildings
chateau rebuild the earth before
chateau....
fix the jammer?
fudou doesn't need it, basa does
it's not
it's not an approval it's an realisation
yep
she finally got to do things in xv
but seriously, 119 was underused
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
punch harder
punch more
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
>one piece filler
<:ChaikaSurprised:273179968031162369>
<:stare:282277202060378133>
shemha is also a God so they can still bullshit anything they want lol
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
planets and the moon are meteorite catchers
ytt wiki is trying to be that later on
<:thonking:284704644540792832>
the Philo wasn't a relic
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
there's no live yet
what live
13 is next saturday
12 aired saturday
do you mean 12 or 13?
<:15min:495770478678638593>
perhaps she just needs a punch
well considering how easy it was to remove shemha from vanessa
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
not everyone plays xdu so unless they picked up the cd, they wouldnt know about eiai promise
and do you really think now they'll write a song reply to a song thats not even from symphogear anime?
the radio
no that was zoid mistling
people have been saying its an answer to eiai promise but it isnt
its different still
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
bcs its a miku battle song and its currently shemha
not because of that
and eiai promise in the anime wouldnt make that much sense
but its not a kmn is a reply to eiai promise
ofc she does
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
voyeur wants it
post it solo
for a moment i was afraid solo was gonna post that fanon pic
<:15min:495770478678638593>
boruto's dad kazanari
gen
i dont think the tl was posted here
the preview for ep 12
in a channel i have muted
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
<:monkaS:391991730486116352>
note that final season only refers to tv-anime
he says you're welcome
<:15min:495770478678638593>
they sound difernt bcs they are different
most of them would work fine when they rewrite it for anime
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
alternate universe one
she's actually fine
then that would be xd quest
if you mean blondie
yea so when a romance show actually does it its pretty 👌
oh we lose, nah we win now
series pull that all the time
it was pretty clear there was a powerup happening with the fusion of the philo and gear pendants
they hinted at amalgam through keywords before sg was a thing though
is it?
i didn't say all <:suhaha:585983562478780416>
it's something geah always neglected
most of the gears don't feel like characters
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
she's actually more a character in this season then in like G
and its shit
and just repeated AXZ with them
but they took the safe route
they should have done that with NR
carol technically also sacrificed herself in GX to save 119
well now you realized
what part of soul do you not get
she sacrificed her soul in G to save jii
he means her soul
snyder is a bad director tho
if you get so much anxiety
honestly i would just advise you to no twatch gear then
no
there isnt actually any difference between keywords in all of the seasons
why would they be
<:smug:239129154061205505>
reminder to tune in 30mins early to watch madoka finale before xv finale starts
you missed the point
it didnt
and gen
and fine
the newer one had bikki
bar s1 maybe
if we followed dino then all posters for gear would be wrong
everytime i open phone
i can look at official art of bikkimiku holding hands <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
its a good poster for screenlock purposes <:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah azoth was placeholder name
well atleast it would be consistent if nothing else
<:15min:495770478678638593>
16
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
ill find out while maint happens if its units at the very least
so I'm totally expecting something xv for xdu that isn't just about the 2 songs we have ingame
we have that livestream sunday which is xv and xdu
airing as scheduled for other channels
it's only for mbs
no
yes
sometimes the unthinkable happens
xD
which i hijacked and disabled checking connection to see if license is valid
my bro needed a license for uni a few years ago
its around the same
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
was air a different version of the special on every tv channel
it's pte so what they did besided the usual va shenigans
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
the OVA has like 30 voice actors
it's worse for the OVA
<:15min:495770478678638593>
they pulled in nana in LL to say like 3 lines in 24 eps
no
rip the audio from ep12 if you wanr aufwachen metanoia
you know better then this
solo pls
well tbf they were only able to xdrive bcs the curse is gone
so shemha takes full control
if bikki dies miku might give up her will
on the contrary
<:harold:364119409620418591>
fire
fire
looks more like burnwounds
it doesn't really look like stone hands to me?
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/logopedia/images/5/5c/Symphogear_XV_Logo.png/revision/latest?cb=20190425142233
like i said
the ep is the xv subtitle
the xv subtitle
you just summed up dr stone, solopy

when are they nuking again
america is a godkiller
well
ye website is big doofus
second half could still be true tho
<:15min:495770478678638593>
in the first paragraph
the keyword even mentions it
ye
it's actually the unforced form
yeah dont need phonic gain to force it
i was typing but discord crashed
oh ye
nothing forced about it
>forced
it's under heavy traffic
just reload
ye
its double
AK did you read glorious america keyword yet?
ye
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
and you were here
we already gave the rundown earlier
the geahs are the gaijins and the gaijins will be geahs
the pics will be switched
nah
shemha needs humanity
shemha isnt gonna delete humanity
and more what the user finds unpure isnt it
its less relics
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
we only did one line
nah
a lot of fighting and a lot of references
they will have touched it no matter what
america is the biggest research institute on heritical crap and relics
america not touching the vambrace would actually out of character
he was right but he  did wrong
eh
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
hat > shemha confirmed
alchemy is a godkiller
the hat has alchemist properties
she cant beat the hat either
<:15min:495770478678638593>
or are they gonna repeat an adam
did she recharge enough power
gods require extreme ideas
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and let bikki punch every single human in the world first
you just keep miku body captive
is it really
i mean
>noise
so its not a was just yet
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bcs final ep didnt air yet
or well is
shemha was going to use humanity to turn them into monsters and wage war against the other annuaki
she spends time there every season
bikki probably knows it inside out
they have their personal medbay anyway
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
its probably still gonna stress their bodies
i wouldnt say just spam it
theres no more curse
there's more to it but i dont have the page open
like how fine said in s1
with the curse gone they cna xdrive without phonic gain blablabla
and thats about it
sol gear would be nice for an ep or 2
but we'll see tomorrow
well thats just the tagline tbh
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
in xdu
the adventures continue
solo
its airing in january yes
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
the numbering doesnt match up <:15min:495770478678638593>
besides
i removed the shwo when it was done airing <a:15min:490152463555624991>
which would be my guess
and he redraw kiri over the actual person in the shot
it actually makes me think if its just a frame of girly air force
but kiri is drawn above the frame and not in the frame so to say
he's the guy they hired for kiri henshin yea
no wait
he is an animator though
not as far as ive seen in the credits that is
<:15min:495770478678638593>
they are not
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/231447613122150401/627463054778564609/xv_13_preview_tl.png?width=236&height=689
also tld version
thats how i felt every season watching gear
or a reason
if they were gonna show him it was in the first half of XV
<:15min:495770478678638593>
well its 45mins if you watch it live
yeah different ways of storytelling
so more or less wouldnt have made a difference
the problem is that they dont know how to juggle around character arcs for gear
anime original is the best way to tell your story
actually no
i honestly doubt it would have turned out that much difference
bds is the only thing that matters is what the crowd parrot when they dont understand how it works
its different for each project
or to be precise
they are not armados
this isnt 2008 anymore were BDs sales mattered
and the more income CR has the more they could potentially spend on licenses
which is more expensive then all the bds they will ever sell
all they would care about is how much money CR would put down to buy the license
or any other streaming service
might as well just sub to CR then
yes but that wasnt the point
the others are just illegal reuploads
only s1 till AXZ are on gear youtube
its not legally on youtube
well they need it or you end up with 3min eps
bcs whoever rips it needs premium
technically you still do
<:obama:439779824299540491>
4 new songs
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
based ver
most were
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
if they dont announce it tomorrow on the livestream then idk when
nothing
no eugene
they first have to announce one
then the ep ends with announcing carol in xdu
but it was funny bcs the first xdu add was narrated by carol saying she still isnt in the game
<:smug:239129154061205505>
but here it was leaked
at least jp didnt know about carol yet
its a new flugel
its a new one
or xdu song
its not G song
new
its eh
||mirai no flugel is the name||
||well everyone cameo'd||
if you use spoiler tags
||ver||
||https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/231447613122150401/627549008360898561/unknown.png?width=1226&height=690||
its skewed results either way
or uses a list website in the first place
and not everyone uses mal
>small amount
>96k
every series does when more peopel watch and rate it
it will drop overtime anyway
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
she as good as graduated
thats just a formality
she doesnt have to attend lydian anymore but she just does till the break
she passed her final exams
or well
yes
KND also played but instrumental
its still the faust robe
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
kiri always has been that type of char
<:15min:495770478678638593>
we had 65 eps
not this again
>13 eps
its not a frame from geah
he works on geah yes
carol
and we also had a new miku song instrumental
and carol in the first 7 way song
just miku extra in flugel and insert song 7 way
forgot the rest of the name
detective something
its just a live action reference
>ofc its a jojo stand but its actually not
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/231447613122150401/627550915443949569/EFkKrjvUYAAAD_5.png
the chris thing was a reference
its legally available to stream
its not available legally for download
its shaider ye
bcs of the earth rotating
he probably fell on his face
but guys
she wasnt in her original body either in start of gx
hopefully full song on bd <:15min:495770478678638593>
they mixed ssj song and eiai song tunes
well <@87512939107450880> the new tune did use some eiai promise tunes
and revue did get an english version of the gacha
revue starlight is more obscure then geah
honestly
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
the best song was miku's song, oh wait
and its also cygames
its a browser game
gbf isnt exactly a mobile game
well almost no game does that
just poke bushiroad enough
Uchuu Keiji Shaider
the animator drew it on later
the kiri isnt part of the sb
the storyboard is real but the kirika was drawn on it
well
exactly
that just left earth
bcs shemha practically confirms theres more of them
its idea 2
next up is the shinais <:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
fine was originally a priestress yes
so basically gear is unlikely but there's always a small chance
so technically they still gave us bikki's bside
they still gave us the B-side instrumentals
just wont be like released tomorrow
we wont
and new songs this ep so even more ded people
people ded
we dont
~~dont forget to tune in on the livestream tomorrow~~
<:15min:495770478678638593>
leaving things up to viewers discretion isnt a bad thing
these are all points they dont have to explain tho
its was mirai no flugel
no
im sure
we want them out as soon as we can
thats a sequel to xdu main story
```An XDU movie regarding the Three Spears of Gungnir event would be great, ngl.
```
except they literally cant
yeah third one according to the wiki
its the second one yes
its this one
https://metalheroes.fandom.com/wiki/Uchuu_Keiji_Shaider
so first they need to do the actual events, then xdu main and then they can do it
its some 1984ish show
what more do you want
but we already had a satisfying conclusion
ask me again when i got time to sink in my thoughts
or they would have to credit every single ost track
they dont credit instrumentals
bcs she didnt sing <@279341087494242304>
we got the intro instrumental so would be weird to not include it
we're probably getting miku on bd also if we are lucky
<:smug:239129154061205505>
just the instrumental yeah
they did
yeah
nothing really more to do for her char wise
its were her arc finished
chris had her resolution in AXZ kinda
likely
which would be a really weird choice
if they announce it not tomorrow it basically means they'll skip bd1 for live lottery
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
or eh never
so either they announce it tomorrow on the livestream
they use BD 1 for lottery tickets
in other seasons the live was already announced
no
there isnt really any difference
its gonna be the same as shemha in ep 9
but why
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
just like at start of xv
i swear bikki would have punched hte bean away
<:Yousoro7:356677867305697280>
fine's pretty cute
the other fgs arent based on relics so no aufwachen
and carol also has it bcs its a relic
its the ssj energy
eventually
```I like how Miku's version takes cues from the wedding gear lol``` same
its already gone here
https://puu.sh/EmwZH.jpg
the converter disappears when she changes
but also
i whale every miku when im out of gems
https://puu.sh/EmwYn.png
or 8
she actually has a converter of sorts in ep 9
ironically
yes hence miku is using the ssj faust robe
and if it was ssj it owuld have looked like G
and not even someone free of the curse can bullshit a gear to appear
the convertor got destroyed in G
miku was a faust robe in xv
repairing isnt the same as making one from scratch
not a gear
it would be a faust robe then
bcs > all caps
i
it was an I06
no
only bd songs are left
all the character cds are out for XV
yeah only flugel isnt subbed in the spanish release
it was all about bikki managing to punch miku
except it actually makes sense
they basically pulled the bikki does the finisher since G
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they actually managed to make a solo bikki attack card work and people still not happy
you cant get better then the lines bikki shouted at miku jut before meta attack card and the lines after
which is fine
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
couldnt you hear the ai desu yo from inside your heart
solopy
it was the only way they could have shoehorned in ver
or pics
ill pm you with the pic then
after the xv xdu livestream
sure avatar but ill wait till tomorrow then
🤔
hmmm
<:thonking:284704644540792832>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i dont trust you to not post it somewhere else
ill wait till monday
there's a nice image avatar would like
🤔
can i post the xdu spoiler here monday
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EFllARoXUAAAmbr.jpg
did you see the handholding
avatar
<:reeee:309960719623782411>
but people still want a fucking kiss
yeah bikki just outright says she loves miku
thats pretty fucking gay from bikki
to never let what i love go again
and with blooming courage
i want to take miku for myself
not to help other people, but because i want it
*then a carol line*

even if thats true
my emotions my feelings for miku
who says they're worth less than 2000 years of curses
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
god bless im a working adult
my wallet loves it
<:kappa:281531248634232842>
300 bd1
300 bd2
300 for the whole series
XV gonna cost me like 900 bucks
same kaliks
i really want to go to the live
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
it would also cost me 75 bucks instead of 300
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
so if they dont announce it i dont need 6bd1s
bcs bd1 generally has the lottery ticket applications
and re-order just 1
but if they dont announce the live tomorrow i need to cancel them all
i have like 6bd1s pre-ordered
bd 1 next week <:15min:495770478678638593>
livestream tomorrow if you want to watch that
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah there needs to be a grace period
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
in the final ep
they appeared right there
i only know minimum wage is like 10.5/h hour
40h weeks are enough for me
so its hard to rent a place alone
its nice but the prices are super high
the one i have is already exhausting enough
i dont think i could handle 2 day jobs with my current job
but thats the US way kaliks
yeah im from belgium
and living alone would practically be suicide here in belgium
and im lucky enough to have a pretty well earning job
i do pay my parents a monthly wage though
i live at home <:15min:495770478678638593>
fair?
i work so i can spend it on anime
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
and did it over an extended epilogue
on the bds
they removed the scrolling credits
they might do like in GX actually
yeah
and then the screenshot from above
reposting full
https://puu.sh/EmzkX.png
when isnt gear rushed <:15min:495770478678638593>
we dont have keywords for ep 13
they're still gonna update the site with new info for the bds and such
yea
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
i saw them in xdu, i dont want to see them in xv
chris was like
nah fam
god i love yukachi
she did eiai promise for axz live
she did that in G
<:genocide:612329552814931968>
i should sleep
talking about the future
the color of the future
<:smug:239129154061205505>
~~checked the bd info on the website~~
shinais start in december
same in g actually
that were black scrolling
they removed like 30seconds of credits
and add some few more seconds
remove scrolling credits, and play it over the epilogue instead
which i could see them doing for xv
serena event
chris event
shivers
brides
at least the ones after half and axz
eh they're fine kaliks
well the worst part about an english release is starting over so fuck that
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
then someone new watched the ep and it starts all over again
sometimes i feel like we talking about shit
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
but ill take it
didnt really need to happen
im w/e about it
you arent really gonna release 1 song
it are just extra songs for the cds
maria still talked about serena in xv
its different tbf
yes
yeah ever since wedding got pulled they changed up stories
which already improves them by half
new events are more condensed with less random fighting
its practically like that since mid last year?
they removed that
they would have to rewrite even the best stories for anime
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
gridman collab was also good but im not gonna count those
producer ver was also good enough
ironically
yeah current event rerun is meh
they actually gave her character
they improved on it
solo what
serena explorers was amazing
she just didnt say it when miku was awake
bikki technically did say it out right
the middle gave us enough answer
ver linker doesnt
K-linker kills you
```A control drug that links the power of sacrists and the human body. It was developed by Div 2's technology expert, Sakurai Ryoko (Fine). Normally, individuals who are not natural Harmonizers cannot become a Symphogear Adaptor. However, if an individual has even a small amount of the necessary link coefficient, the LiNKER drug can forcibly raise that amount to the level of a Harmonizer.

Of course the higher the link coefficient must be raised, the greater the strain put upon the body. It is an incredibly dangerous and intense drug. Subjects who used it were often put into a state of shock and lost consciousness, and clinical trials resulted more often in crippling or killing individuals than actually turning them into a Harmonizer. It was for this reason that the drug was changed to put a time limit upon its effectiveness, and also a method developed to cleanse it from the body. Samples of LiNKER along with data taken from the subject Kanade Amou, were leaked by Sakurai Ryoko to the American F.I.S. whose biochemists were tasked with tweaking and manufacturing the drug on a larger scale. Under the charge of Dr. Ver the project proceeded under the theme of "Pleasant for you" and they managed to develop a safer form of LiNKER with a very small physical burden and a more thorough cleansing process.```
i dont see why not
we probably will
kanade linker doesnt reduce the impact of a zesshou iirc
```kanade would have died with or without linker```
she just did it through linker and sheer will
she was never actually meant to use a symphogear
she was already on deaths door by the time ep1 starts
kanade would have died with or without linker
they finished her arc in axz
chris didnt need it
they jsut needed an epilogue
i dont think they treated dmjii that bad
cant be geah without a flugel song
it was a flugel song yes
thats how you are not supposed to slam in a wall
maria
worth it
but they all punched
using her hair as a whip
<:MikuPraise:584465493176352768>
but she did it
it only took her 5 seasons
and i love it
this is actually the first time they outright implemented the key visual
🤔
did we actually go gayer then bikki shouting her love for miku is stronger then whatever something 2000 years shemha
too bad its xdu <:15min:495770478678638593>
eiai promise is actually gayer
but this was completely fine tbh
like i wouldnt have mind it happening or have a logner epilogue
<:smug:239129154061205505>
well gotta make sure i don't miss the stream later today so gn
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
if you just looked at xdu memoria kanade art you would think she's a big player <:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
and they can't read between the lines
some people need to see it to believe it
~~pimsan~~
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
let me get on pc
how much effort do i want to put in this 🤔
it's different
it's not the same song
it uses some of the tunes
it's not eiai promise
it wasn't
it wasn't
granted in the end they did fuse those with their older relics
aigis miku
spacenade
```And yet there is no alternate universe with an actual new Symphogear relic```
there's though
it's why you sometimes see 2 miku 1 edgebikki or variants
they reunited at the end of the event
miku moved away after the concert
we have like 5 or 6 alternate universes
nah that's also a different timeline
and mainline basa joins in iirc
ye
alternate timelines are fun
the gear users
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
it's why we have gen, fine and ver fighting
they all died in one timeline
ssj gear is gone since g
its a faust robe
they went of their way to make a new track so probably
maybe bd6?
who knows
different songs


ok im done
hibimiku
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
actually i need to remember how to do audacity
hold on folks
ok i can do this
kdn is the only bside i listened too
i admit
<:15min:495770478678638593>
why did carol have to sing with a fg
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
renaming is easy anyway
https://puu.sh/EmJe2.png
turns into that jumble mumble above
https://puu.sh/EmJdR.png
apparently not when uploading music?
too bad discord doesnt read jp names
converted^

i can convert it if you give me a second
and used full relic a la nephustan
it would only make sense if miku happened to have the relic pieces in her jacket
which doesnt matter when there's only pendant made from it
then idk what i can tell you
when keywords go out of the way to explicitly state that ssj symphogear is gone
no
you dont magically make a new converter appear out of thin air
except its not
no that wasnt an error
regular miku didnt had it at all
before it disappears on the transformation scene
shemha miku also has the converter
7 relics yes
so it cant be a gear anyway
its missing the converter
the same melody
she doesnt go into it without the harp playing
its practically her activation
and there's no unit converter on miku
with the harp melody
carol was also activated through a chant
different pendant
same relic
the cms are adlibbed <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
2 october
6 november
4 december
8 january (yay birthday release)
5 february
4 march
yes
first is rokka and remnant
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bcs i already know all they will announce for xdu
well they better announce that geah live
yeah bonus cd with the bd
ye
LL lives has worldwide livestreams
i was answering to sorano's post anyway
<:15min:495770478678638593>
geah isnt love live
yeah its gonna happen but no confirmation
but no live announced
it ended liek an hour ago
maybe you people should learn about studio's first and foremost
it doesnt
same as OP
world trigger
not talking about the story
DBS was bad animation wise bcs they had no episode director early on,m when they fixed that it was good
OP is the same as ever, slow pace but when it matters once again its good
WT, when it matters its good
they would have been out of businness a long time ago
do you really think that one of the oldest and most grossing anime studio's have most of their projects flop?
they dont tho?
toei is very fucking good with raising people
all come from toei
everyone that matters in other studios
armados
lets jsut call it agree to disagree
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
why is precure by toei i big minus lol
for then once
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
no point buying bd1 at least
yeah
maybe show the other gears
but i dont think xv end needs fixing
yea
G also a few seconds for epilogue
the only pendant that existed for ssj has been gone since G
but those weren't made into a pendant
they clearly exist when they were used around the vambrace
i would call it just like the ending, up to your own interpretation
but ep 13 is eh
yeah its a fg
~~someone look if nephus chris had a converter~~
<:15min:495770478678638593>
a) its the faust robe
b) miku put ssj relic fragments in her pockets , hence the chant to activate them so full relic
you have 2 options
if you said in general they're bad i would have agreed
so am I
wt probably 2 or 3
3 teams on op
they have 4 teams on super
they're different people
you cant compare show x and show y and show z with eachother
it doesnt work that way though
🤔
carol wouldn't have that knownledge
they released axz ep 13 2ish weeks ago so no idea why kuro
they picked it up a few months ago ay
axz doesn't though that's the tv version they have for streaming
they have bd masters yes
even stills would have worked
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
normal fg or philo powered fg
wait
that's unfair solo
<:harold:364119409620418591>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
he has more money then the whole anime industry combined
```that would require an insane amount of budget.```
just befriend elon
so they released it on cr but didnt add it to vrv yet
lmao
there's no bad meegu
ill whale all of them
also all of them
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
or wedding veil ssj
black dress hot miku
<:DiaReee:288212140400312321>
the question is meegu when
doesn't matter
<:15min:495770478678638593>
she punched
just more extreme
same thing she did with Vanessa tbh
yes it is
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
I'm rewatching IS but i can only handle 1 ep a week
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
so we might as well call it IS s3
next you're gonna say the mc is one super dense guy
she did yes
<:nao:277264525219069952>
she actually has a pretty good voice range
eh
there's enough fresh blood available anyway
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
just cast super veterans to voice the mothers
<:harold:364119409620418591>
too old
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
hey i was elza in xv but now I'm playing tsubaki in Sympho NS
they recast kana <:LUL:243896110001684480>
ye
and putting newbies in the spotline with 1 veteran would actually be very good for them
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
they would just have to do that x times over
reminder thzt geah practically launched inorins music carreer
it doesn't have to be all star cast
<:BERSERKBU:497710764144984064>
>remembering 3.5
they didn't
rie kugimiya
hana kana
perfection
yes pls
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
solo please
goku isn't her only voice
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
nozawa
a disaster
that would be eh
we need to wait and see what they will actually do in the coming weeks/months with a live announcement
its only theoretical for now baka
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
then XV will have the worst sales since s1
but if they do not announce a live at all
so if they announce a live they would have to put it on later volumes so then those will be higher as opposed to G-GX-AXZ
no lottery codes on bd1
XV wont even reach 10k on bd1
ignoring s1 G-GX-AXZ did ~20k on bd1
we wont be able to compare XV with the other seasons afaik
well
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
i would pay for all of it
actually would pay money to see full power adam vs shemha
please can we not
> force of all things
and if im not mistaken for satelight shows that refer to the episode
the corner also says #01
thats just one of the animators of geah having a lot of fun
serena, kanade and miku arent gear users in the main storyline still
story will be added regardless
it will
but ye should be in that channel
reki improved a lot between sao and alicization
eh
in stores
you tend to be able to buy bds the day before they're officially released
~~AR is already out~~ just gotta wait for someone to upload
yes
ssj was yes <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
wedding miku is 393
great
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
classic
>notices the 1 sec frame
>doesn't notice the 4sec frame
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
my job
oh well back to work
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
that was actually too much effort
i heard my name <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
the manga came later
no
precure is also original yes
only canipa is worth watching as he actually talks about the industry <:MichaHee:260224421476696064>
>anitubers
or you could be like wug where the girls wanted to continue but the management didn't extend contracts
nanjou knees are imploded bcs of her carreer
well
but i need to go home now <:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
nana doesn't want to retire till she's above 70 or so
petit milady with ayane and aoi is almost purely anisong
ayahi is in sphere but I'm not sure how well known they are outside of the anisong circle
nana is the only one also active outside of anisong tho
they are all anisong singers
amazon didnt ship my copy last night so i expect it to be shipped tonight
someone just needs to upload them
yes it is
time
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
or put it on xdu
release a shitty version digitally with a magazine
maybe they will do like AR
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
stalker estimates were like 10kish?
i really doubt its gonna be that high
yeah its only week 1 sales and not the total
maybe its just 1 week sales? but thats eh a weird thing to do
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
20k or so for v1
and s4 is actually eh
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the unconfirmed numbers are also based with cancelled bds still in it
play xdu for that <:LUL:243896110001684480>
nah
we only had sun gears as a sequel to it so when we get more xd main line story it's probably gonna pop up again
thanks to notfine
it fused
aigis was one of the relics original to xdu
how that works idk<:LUL:243896110001684480>
she got aigis and has a fusion gear
miku in xdu doesn't have ssj anymore
then ver would have won with the frontier
pretty much
it's why she had to use her hair because her sword was gone
she went straight through basas sword
it was?
in xdu they especially wrote it so that miku isn't allowed to use her ssj except in emergency situations. so thats not really gonna change
🤔
based on what information shops give them
oricon/pripri comes closest with like 70% tracking of bd sales
they almost never post sales data
there's never gonna be an official count btw
<:15min:495770478678638593>
it is ruby, but you can see from the reddit link that everyone jumps the gun
bcs there was no live announced
it,s taking into account event ticket sales which do simply not exist for volume 1
also the projected sales for XV is ~11k which is actually in line with non event ticket bds for gear
that 15k on axz was with event ticket btw <a:15min:490152513623031809>
26k without event ticket is not realistic
as i said yesterday
only asumin are
no
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
but you wont get rips if nobody uploads them
the bd is out
not confirmed
except on yt
yeah everywhere its xtreme
no question asked
>google
granted jpdvdbd died last year so axz are uncomplete
its the updated version with total
better
http://www.someanithing.com/JP_DVDBD_WIKI/2017/%E6%88%A6%E5%A7%AB%E7%B5%B6%E5%94%B1%E3%82%B7%E3%83%B3%E3%83%95%E3%82%A9%E3%82%AE%E3%82%A2.html
total goes up to 20k+ afaik
they have bene doing staff interviews every week
https://symphogear-xv.com/special/sp13_relay10.php
aoi and yukachi interview <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
so soon
my bd arrives monday bcs i wasn't home today
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
akira has been doing some rough keyword tls iirc, kaliks
it gets mentioned in todays keyword
<:genocide:612329552814931968>
and at the end with the shield and carol
<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
when live watching and nobody knew what was gonna happen and suddenly a phara foot shows up
same
hope they announce them sooner then later for xv
and in artbooks
~~ive been listening to it since yesterday~~
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
maybe we shouldnt leak songs that arent ingame just yet
no reason to let the cashcow die just yet
http://portal.symphogear.com/
keep everything in one place
its just a portal site
that said, they launched a new geah site today
they're on the website
there's an unknown amount anyway
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
well we saw 2 custodians so plural is correct anyway
>reading wiki comments
he did want to destroy all of them but only one was near
NR says it clearly he wants to destroy the vambrace in ep 2
why would he want to destroy the vambrace if he wasn't worried
but he was?
lyrics by agematsu
composed by Ryota Tomaru
arranged by Ryota Tomaru
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
and nobody knew yesterday what i was saying
https://puu.sh/Ep3s7.png
but yeah its likely to be the last song for the xdu v2 album
<:smug:239129154061205505>
its end of the event thing
its not
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
but yeah i just dont like songs and shit leaked
<:smug:239129154061205505>
would actully be more idiotic
<:smug:239129154061205505>
no
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
lucky guys on the twitter campaign
yeah
at least chris had her arc finished in axz, unlike dmjii
yeah
<:15min:495770478678638593>
topdad btw
thanks kaneko
https://puu.sh/Eppf3.png
<:AinyaGasm:356682640494952458>
>s1-4 are just training montages
<:harold:364119409620418591>
its kanekonese
nothing that was unexepected tbh
ye
he just talked about the broad sense of humans <:15min:495770478678638593>
the interviewer asks kaneko to tell about bikki and miku relationship
what did he say
this is it
oh boy
```響と未来の関係について、もう少し詳しく教えていただけますか。```
<:15min:495770478678638593>
so yeah not all higher ups
kaneko made it sound it was him and a producer
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
lol kaneko reinforcing once again that he didnt want ssj to happen back in G
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
and he wanted adam included in the ending scene with all the ghosts but he didnt want to overburden the staff
tfw he actually wanted to write more about adam's past and how he failed originally
<@139432096023183360> the adam segment is probably my favourite part of the interview
kaneko today iirc
they added agematsu yesterday
they'll be wrong anyway bcs it's agematsu <:suhaha:585983562478780416>
np
<:smug:239129154061205505>
🤔
actual good rips for bd1 songs are now on nyaa btw <:15min:495770478678638593>
ye solo but i didnt check yet if its the full version like they used in later eps or kept it in as it was
thanks to light for encoding that cut though
but glad you enjoy it
it took me 6+hours to upload the bdmv
<:harold:364119409620418591>
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
latex
only after a few days
depends
yeah they either out right steal without crediting at all or actually credit
i didn't had that problem
that's not the same at all
2021 is already stretching it
2 years is too long
yes it would
that's way too late
no
with current schedule
either it's fall or 2021
but they aren't
spring would make sense if lottery was in bd1 and 2
june is too soon when final bd happens in march
but those sell out in 2mins so
general applications are a thing for leftover spots
that would be nice
cds would have been an option
what else <:15min:495770478678638593>
bds
~~lowest since s1~~
<:15min:495770478678638593>
11k confirmed
oh sales
discotek already confirmed s1 will be sub only so <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
i would say yes?
yes
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i dont but i also have
<:MariaAgent:278546060849184769>
they're so much better then normal band concerts
if they announce one i just hope i win lottery <:suhaha:585983562478780416>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
dw i watched axz live in Japan so i know how that feels
y
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
was perfect
geah aired at 6pm my timezone
its an emote from sgg <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:BERSERKBU:497710764144984064>
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
you will find out
<:eeh:242112096584728576>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
in our hearts it didnt
<:smug:239129154061205505>
he just says the annuaki so maybe all of them
he's pretty important, kaneko said it himself
every line adam said in AXZ was talking about XV
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
bcs adam was actually important
kaneko wanted adam to be in the remnant scene but he didn't want to overwork the animators when they already had to draw so many
yes kerrik
at most you are getting adam if they update that show
after the fusion
no
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
fine used durandal just to power the lasers
the whole thing was stupid to begin with
solo no
if we want to be precise
durandal with bikki power actually
but like armados said, it doesnt actually matter
im looking at ver holding it right now
it actually isnt
the key
only the top remains, the handle is gone
it clearly broke
no?
yes
it just got destroyed
it was destroyed
they fixed the fix <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:obama:439779824299540491>
totally not ver
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
and then someone spawned noise inside the base
in the US base in Iwakuni
america research insitute aka FIS was gonna conduct research on it
it was a collaboration
they were
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
yeah they send it to FIS
they did though
yeah the cane keyword just mentions they retrieved it at the area were the gears and fine fought
nice
https://puu.sh/EscyB.png
<:smug:239129154061205505>
actually swing it around maybe
idk rady
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
she didnt actually need that with nephus regen
yeah in the serpent she used it just so she could use laser beams
my bd upload is ytt only, sorry ak <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yes, geah was orchestrated by lelouch
it's actually a geass
<:harold:364119409620418591>
march next year
idk how school works there
korean
and took extra classes
our tl has exams
yes
well actually finishing the tv series should be higher priority right now
ep 12 and 13 first
we at YTT will release them eventually
commie hasnt even finished G bds yet
<a:15min:490152513623031809>
just name them after the voice actors name
<:smug:239129154061205505>
not again
gotta swing something when your sword is broken
he still impacted their lifes in case of fis even before his g shenigans
as shit as ver was
too much to draw is the tldr in the end
Can't let bikki have nice things and actually save one
my main problem is still that it was azx alch 2.0
because they can bundle it with a movie <:15min:495770478678638593>
people go watch them because you get exclusive goodies
well why is a good question
1 run of a compilation movie generally nets them more then bds
they *do* make money and thats why you see a lot of them
you're gonna get a compilation movie if they even do one
you're not gonna get a new movie
together with basa
you mean the part where the chateau dissected the world btw and later restored the same buildings without the humans?
i cant really see it getting brought over besides like a super limited screening
yeah
if its clsoe to AX or CR expo ~70%
if not eh 20%
hmm
they're in separate categories for movies
db is also a daytime show and geah is a late night anime <:15min:495770478678638593>
it has its own charm
vamb probably attached itself instead if nr doing it imo
vanessa is the real hack here
the dress is just whatever tbh
the faust doesn't make sense
if anything solo
she doesn't actually wear the vambrace till you see her with black clothing
clearly didn't work well enough <:LUL:243896110001684480>
yes
doesn't actually have to wear it
the vambrace probably works when in close proximity
unlike mister dude
miku didn't put on the vambrace tho
at that point
i would expect a forced posession
she magically wore the vambrace btw bcs nr sure as hell didn't put it on her.
i just think of it as what rady said tbf

curse blocks shem-ha, genes became dormant.
miku gets cleansed, genes still dormant.
miku next to vambrace, genes awaken.
ye
miku let her in <:15min:495770478678638593>
only bcs of the curse
i don't think she has too
so everyone is shemha
the part with the lunar ruins crashed into earth
easily solved
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
oh
do you really think the site will update?
why 25th
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
Can't you see and maria
They're in no condition at all <:ADAM:338363978797547539>
she's an annuaki which are gods in geahverse<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
y
well there are ways....
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
from alpaca hunter i think
yeah i  remember something liek that
feel free to try
first thing i did was that
i could disable that function at the wc in my hotel
so just need to wait on id
we know of 2 who are fine but not any of the others.
well yes andmeuths studio 1 housed all of their directors and was their main animation building
in japan
well its like the biggest massacre in close to 20ish years
what pisses me off the most are people who are posting but meh kyoani anime will be delayed
not really
no
as fucked up as that sounds
it sounds worse but its the better dead
but from the smoke
technically most didn't die of being burned
they wouldn't have bat an eye if nobody got hurt solo
hence this hits hard for them
japan is rather safe
same
this one might be an exception case
jsut for exception cases
japan has death penalty but almost never enforce it
yeah
i would hope at HQ
japan is tech illiterate really
and if they also used master tapes for achiving there then those are also lost
but yeah everything they did had at studio 1 is lost
well i dont htink everything they had was at studio 1 afaik
they lsot ~25% of their staff yeah
90% sure he will get death penalty
yeah they arent
yeah its fucked up
so it was clearly planned by the guy in question
but they disabled it bcs they had guests
the worst part of it all is that they did have a security system
this is an anime studio
nah
kyoani operated like a normal 9-5 company unlike most of the rest
perhaps
so they might actually have problems going to other studio's as they're not used to how those do it
the only problem sort of is that kyoani works differently then other studio's
at least not for tv anime
i just hope they aren't gonna close down but when you lose 34 people out of 120 idk
until they sort them themselves out
like every current kyoani project
canned
though every theater is sold out of the free movie
but yeah that sequel movie for 2020? probably eh
compilation movie sure but better then nothing
Free!-Road to the World-the Dream is airing as normal afaik
considering shit still gets send through tapes to tv stations, dont expect actual digital backups <:15min:495770478678638593>
offsite backups isnt really a thing for animation studio's
president Hatta plans to demolish studio 1 as quick as possible to make it into a park with a monument
yes
https://rollingstone.uol.com.br/noticia/estudio-de-pokemon-e-akira-kyoto-animation-e-destruido-em-incendio-criminoso/?fbclid=IwAR0mnYxeUWUe8zXWox3k5QLQ0oCCES5raL--kxeFWMDnzjM8XfB337NVz9g
the brazil one takes the cake
yeah
could be
maybe he did
but that was nt a mass murder
they did have a fire with 44 deaths in the early 90s also iirc
sarin gas attacks
yeah greatest mass murder in ~20 years
i want to stay positive and have hope because i know when they rrelease the victims list it will rip me apart
sadly enough
and so is many other
we only know of her fate from a few hours ago
miku is alive and she did the same?
yeah
the only news we had that miku who was also missing yesterday is fine and is at a relative
yeah
even more so for an animation studio
they likely had
not sure
they introduced these because they had so much women
they had more females then men before that
nah
<:15min:495770478678638593>
typo
yeah
everything other studio's dont have
and a good stable wage
and have a nursery and maternity leave
> every city that got featured in a kyoani anime is doing a donation
>sentai internationally
> animate stores all over japan (and bangkok)
> flying witch author is donating part of the money for selling volume 8
and there's a whole lot of donations happening
thats where all the donations would come in handy for
<:15min:495770478678638593>
kyoani was the owner
I went there not even a year ago but I'm going to make sure to go again to place flowers
stuff does happen from time to time
i wouldn't say that ayamine
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
yeah
<:15min:495770478678638593>
took drugs erased from existence in japan
like that one yakauza vocie actor?
and japan does it worse
everything smells besides gas
I just don't like coffee
<:15min:495770478678638593>
I'm a civilized person
I drink tea
now that stuff is nasty
I still rather drink a few bottles of beer then to touch an energy drink
1 glass a week or so
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
in moderation
reminder that red wine is good for your heart
and everything is fine if you keep it reasonable
second hand smoke is actually worse then smoking itself
that's pretty eh wrong
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bcs they add a chemical to it so you can smell it
one could say you gas also smells then
metal has a smell
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
it's only as shady as you make them to be.<:15min:495770478678638593>
ye they're continueing lol
now that you mention kyoani.
Hatta the president mentioned today they'll keep going.
well those 2 species are omnivores so you could just give them whatever
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
that's why you should keep pigs or chickens
http://www.kyotoanimation.co.jp/information/?id=3075

they psoted donation details if you want to donate direct
so far my rejections have been with calls
I would prefer a call tbh
jp gov is also looking if they can reduce the taxes half or completely for the gofundme donation money
yeah but it was weird to read
that reminds me of when i first visited Japan. One of the ryokan we were going to had old books you could read through. one of them was an old japanese history book and it was written as such that the Nanjing massacre was a good event
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2019-08-02/kyoto-police-release-names-of-10-victims-who-died-in-kyoto-animation-fire/.149629
which costs you another 2k+ bucks
before you can attempt motorbike theory and practical again
and 7 years experience of driving a car
and you also need a driving license for a car bnefore you can get one for a motorbike
so is it here
like give those some classes
bikes are way worse then cars
bikes also
not just cars
you know what they also should actually learn
thats something that isnt gonna stick
indeed
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
>expecting people to properly merge
bad habits doesnt mean you arent following your countries road laws
its not tbh
or the old ones
not the middle aged ones
the ones doing the bad habits are the young people here
or get caught by police
unless you get an accident
but no retakes from 30-60
and then from 60 till you cant drive anymore
tbh like retake test every 3 years from 18 to 30
but it is pretty expensive here
it shouldnt be
here it would be
retaking test 5 years is stupid bcs here they will just take all of your money
ye
and now they added a new law that old people need to retake tests every few years
no driving after22pm and no driving on holidays and weekends
even solo driving while learning you were restricted
waste of money
it also costs like over 2k bucks here
it worked that way in the 60s and the 70s here
you can do 10h driving class also but then you cant drive alone
and then another exam after another 6 months
then we need to do an exam with an instructor after 3-6months
we need to follow 20hs driving class with an instructor to be able to drive alone
but i have to go now
the vic stuff
<@188714906143424513> today is court day to see if turns into a trial
tomorrow is when we will know the verdict
yeah agree on that
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
if you feel adventerous, blindfold yourself and put a finger down on a random place in japan
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
mom still thinks i'll be going home with a japanese girl every time i visit hapan
i do a bit of both whenever i go, just hang out and do sight seeing stuff and another time do some anime pilgrimage <:15min:495770478678638593>
but they did say they will erect a memorial on the place
most of it will go to family and medical costs
they're fucking it over in all ways
same is happening with overwatch
heroes is very much alive
tencent owns 100% of the shares
well riot is owned by a chinese company

it did went more a la E3 the later and later
it was about the community yes
they just dont do anything outside of that
they wouldnt be organizing blizzcon really if it wasnt for that
```I doubt blizzard actually cares at all about "building a diverse and inclusive community"```
they do in a roundabout way?
instead of having to miss it
the 6months ban is enough for him to be able to play in next seasons pro scene
they dialed it back to 6 months and prize money back
and no prize money
it was a year
which is why this controversy is happening in the first place
blitz shouldnt have said it on the stream yeah but it was very poorly handled by blizzard
that was a point in the "brack"statement yes
the style betweenm that post and an actual brack written post is too different
it was written by a chinese writer in english
and its not actually written by Brack
on another discord
we actuallyt went over it
at least they're backtracking on their decisions right, that must make it good /sarcasm

i cringe every time someone posts a sankaku link
<:15min:495770478678638593>
would have tought they would also no it
surprised labour supported it
<:15min:495770478678638593>
so its rip again
which is the next step
there's a deal but parties still need to approve of it
thats his point
they didnt want drawings, they wanted real
didnt work either, it wasnt CP
i know one where they let pedo's read lolicon content as treatment
<:15min:495770478678638593>
iirc the study turned out like the video games cause violence
with pedo's in prison
netherlands did a study about it iirc
fallout76 is just the icing on the cake on all the issues bethesda has
which is only good bcs of all the mod support players gave it
including skyrim
all of their games have been bad
<:monkaS:391991730486116352>
you literally cant publish microtrans focused games here
also why belgium pulled the plug on those sort of games
yeah the microtrans was awful
granted DICE is bought out by EA
that's still DICE
they dont develop it
EA just published it tho
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
there's annoying people here, there's annoying people there
some people like me just dont care
<:15min:495770478678638593>
money isnt what they want
you would need to have the contacts
they arent selling stuff to randoms
it would make it harder
i'm sure they'll be trying in due time to get into it

and you know how many disney has?
anyway the only thing that matters in the anime industry is contacts
ded studio <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
imagine buying out something thats 90% freelance
man if only it works that way <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>

the anime industry itself is killing itself already
Disney doesn't even need to intent or try
they really can't right now
heck cr has more power then disney in the anime industry
well Disney doesn't make or own "anime" so how exactly are they gonna damage the anime industry
~~always hated reading those netflix gonna save anime articles~~
because licensing series and completely removing them from tv broadcasts is saving the industry
same crap
see netflix
people would hail them as the saviour
it would be the other way around
or well was
the point is that they can't kill the industry
but it will take years and years
its not impossible, see netflix
it doesnt work that way but ok
who also license it
thats not the industry
they dont even care about the industry
they have none
hard enough to not matter for multiple years
you couldnt delete your accounts
blizzard closed down the option
it was
they started blizzcon with HK <:harold:595434251286085653>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
d4 already confirmed
yeah tickets go in sale like june, july usually
you cannot go on the grounds without a ticket
the protesters also paid
people spend 1k+ to go to blizzcon, getting bothered would just sour what should have been 3 days of fun
that's what I'm the most afraid about
as long as they don't start to bother guests
yea
instead of using an old manga volume cover
maybe they should have requested a new drawing
that one is pretty tame
its 5mins work so you have bigger issues then
i can deleter my account, restore it and get my wow chars back
<:15min:495770478678638593>
wow has restore options
doesnt work for wow
eh nothing
in the convention itself nobody happens
pretty sure it's supposed to be a permaban
should have just forwarded him to discord tos
i could vote blanco
i literally dont want to vote bcs they're all shitty politics
now they need to do it regionally so i can sit home in my bed instead of going to vote <:15min:495770478678638593>
the best thing they announced this year is removing mandatory voting for local governments <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
there's no software on the ones we use either but for the rest of the specifics i have no idea
backup pen and paper it was
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
the first year they did electronic voting here the electricity went down because of thunderstorm and they couldnt get the voting machines working again after electricity went up
for technical reasons at least
we actually switched back to handvoting for the past few years
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
the cities that didnt want to change to digital said that fraud didnt happen with their handvoting
nah its ironic in the sense of
and ironically those are the parts were fraud still happens
we still have handvoting on certain parts
belgium
its more reliable then handvoting here
they only get taken out when voting has to happen
they were designed for voting purposes only
we use computers to vote with ~~technically tablets~~
gotta head out for a bit now tho
but its something the government can do
only one time tho
it happened here before cypher
and after that they just re-instate him again
theoretically bcs the government has the power to remove the king and get someone else to sign it
theoretically the king can still oppose every new law by not signing at least
<:15min:495770478678638593>
they want Brussels to stay as their HQ
well they would
let alone a country
they've been trying to split Brussels for 50 years and they still didnt work it out
im confident its not gonna happen anyway
they have been trying for ages
and the guy is an extreme dutch nationalist
(belgium is split between dutch and french)
and a guy that wants to split belgium again
and now we have a party on top of the goverment thats very anti immigrants
but here its just a shitshow
well i reckon it works better in india
which is the problem
its not what the people voted for
its bad
yeah
so they got the majority
the 3 parties that lost big had 10 and 20 but they banded together which totalled 58%
highest voted party had 42%
ye
democracy at its finest
our highest voted party isn't even part of the government
then again
at least locally i can vote on the bf of a friend, unlike regionally
which isnt exactly the solution as you dont want to vote the highest party but blanco gives them still the vote
but blanco gets counted for the majority vote
north/east new wales had the order to fully evacuate
friend in aus is also fine
ye
west and south are relative low on fire
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/121123915346083840/643338616344412190/image0.png
it's everwhere tbh
rip
yeah
fakku releasing everything uncensored and in good paper quality caused other publishers to follow suit at least
and he had the balls to reply back to one of them and managed to make a deal
ye jacob told how it started
they also got hundreds of dcma from publishers
the same thing CR did in 2009<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
people hate them from going illegal to legal and fucking over the hmanga scene and stuff
everyone hates on fakku but they at least have no drm and you own what you bought<:15min:495770478678638593>
kinda like majority of digital services
and you don't actually own what you buy
it's just digital and drm
mangaplus is a good step in the right direction
reading the thing is different
but you can buy the thing
scanlation was already illegal tho
the license itself is cheap, its what comes before thats super expensive (driver license)<:15min:495770478678638593>
visiting a nuclear power plant was probably the best thing about my electricity course back in school
just heavy focus on heavy water which the allied kept bombing like melua said
yeah
well nobody even knew how far germany was with the research
nuclear reactor plants all use water to block the nuclear energy that gets free
water's actually good to block radioactive material
aka nukes
germany used heavy water as a component for a nuclear reactor
the 2011 tsunami
yeah but the key factor for that one was an external issue
the whole setup is pretty simple tbh
and visited one twice
thought in uni and got drilled on it on school
solar also powers a turbine
yeah
thats how nuclear plants work yea
if there's a crack in it you have more problems then just nuclear steam
closed off ofc
the reactor is inside the water
no
water is the best isolator
water is just an isolator
mostly
100% safety doesnt exist anyway
<:15min:495770478678638593>
there's only so much you can do before an external force puts its all on its head
fire protocols only take in account a normal fire
but those dont do anything when its about a petrol started fire
they also had fire protocols
but its liek the kyoani fire
they have them
they didnt expect a tsunami to happen when the eq happened
yeah the tsunami was a surprise
they would have
for which one
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
belgium is gone but france will be safe
so if it ever goes wrong
actually a smart place
and france also pulled there powerplant in a stupid fucking place
but places just dont have enough space for green energy to rival what a nuclear power plant can do
poeple keep going on about shutting them down
nuclear power is the easiest way to make electricity afaik
then the whole of belgium is gone
honestly if the nuclear reactor here ever goes critical
yea
well i mean they knew it was going to be a slow meltdown
its simply mother nature
nothing they could have done
yeah
then the tsunami happened and killed the pumps
which were powering the pumps
followed by the emergency diesel generators starting up
but the earthquake killed the electricity grid
bcs of the warning they went into emergency mode
it started with the earthquake though
the tsunami killed the pumps
<:harold:595434251286085653>
so might be a bit older
bcs she already hired a young boy for her mvs last year
not sure when the radio actually happened though tbf
but even kaiki (who subbed it) said he could have used better words for some sentences
the radio is real
and if it goes like this we're gonna break our own world record for being without a government
dw solo we dont either
here it depends on how much you earn
i would get some money back
>I'm fine paying an extra 20p on a frozen pizza if it means that I don't pay £3k when I need an ambulance

same and thats not all
but they're mostly desk jobs
certain government jobs are also tax free over here
everything food/drink related is accounted for in the restaurant version here iirc
which was 8%vat i believe
21% vat here except restaurants
a lot of european countries do this
yes
personal tax here is 40% between 13k-23k euro
the cap on the uk is higher at least
^
¯\\_(ツ)\_/¯
I'm on 40% tax
<:useless:272874872416370689>
tv stations pulling it but more streaming services picking it up
i also expect the same to happen as what happened with reviewers
goblin also framed it differently compared to the ln
assuming they're even gonna show it
its just about what it showed while airing
they call it smut
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
if reviewers aired on tv then eh everything can air on tv in japan
and now they enforced some of the rules again
> Covid in Aus has been interesting, we basically had it under control then the government started to lift restrictions and we saw an immediate second wave
same over here
yeah fireworks is nasty stuff
we still have our jp overlords for microtransactions<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
```Tencent ownership stakes in gaming

tencent owns 100% shares in riot games
essentially yes?
so nothing gaming related unless you use wechat to purchase currency
it's pretty vague tho
it's only against Wechat and not Tencent as a whole
https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-posed-wechat/
Shimabukuro (Toriko) got convicted and arrested for CP, including to pay to have sex with a 16 year old girl, he initially got a 2 year prison sentence which was suspended and wsj cancelled his manga, later on he wrote Toriko for WSJ which became one of their top sellers.

Watsuki(Kenshin) got arrested for purchase of CP, after Japan made the law changes about CP but i dont remember if it was during the grace period they had given people or not. They fined him 200000 jpy, WSJ put his manga on hiatus and the next year his manga resumed.
yeah this is like the third time it happens with a wsj author and they didnt do anything, nor the police
if any of the previous 2 examples are to go by? Police isnt gonna do anything and WSJ is just gonna throw it under the rug for a few months.
beating our previous world record of 541 from back in 2010
we are now at 592 days
but ye we still don't have a finalized one since we went voting.
the current one is just to be able to accept/decline stuff for covid related matters that have to happen at government level.
<a:15min:585535714943434770>
just a temporary one
> And even without gouvernement for months the country still work somehow
bcs we have a government
no idea on that
or they were using the google cloud bug <:15min:655058014495047690>
as i reckon they probably get a lot of dcma from western companies
and their provider caved in
copyright claims to their servers provider instead of going through KA itself?
the updated law isnt even in effect yet
>Because of that law,  kissmanga got shut down.

it did not
your economy isnt gonna be functioning even with the 1%

yeah that doesn't really say much bcs jeoparty wasn't even a thing over here

the other guy might have been confused as both flu and covid are contagious respiratory illnesses (but caused by different viruses)
sounds about right bcs sars is also a coronavirus <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
the point is that those witnesses didnt had anything to say
that screenshot i posted a few days ago was one of those court cases dismissed
and it works
idk we still have it for work
they made it business only like last year or 2 years ago
they killed it
its weird it updates the hour
yeah same
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
it actually gives a different time for me
37 or so atm
didn't the whitehouse acc actually tweeted out he signed an action to end private prisons
unlike usual
but they actually showed the penis
yea
and eh reviewers
like vaginas or penises, which you would see on hentai
you see the act but not the sexual parts
it's more like smut
what
the real meat is in the wn, didnt read the ln so idk how much got edited out on that either
the anime is pretty tame
Siokonbu writes a lot of NTR and stuff but redo author writes way worse stuff
eh disagree
did the guy drink it or something?

just do be able to do my job as electrician
i have like 9 or 10 rn
lots of certifications to get afterwards also <:LUL:545650745534447631>
not the college kind ofc
you're not gonna become an electrician over here without it
though in the end we need that certain piece of paper over here in either case
~~household electrician is boring af~~
industrial is quite different
ye
you learn the maths which is really good! but the use of practice for them is diminishing.
its all done by computers (for example)
you're not actually gonna calculate the diameter of cables when you need a length of x by hand
granted i work industrial and everything just gets calculated by programs and your boss.
don't think i've actually ever had to use math as electrician <:15min:655058014495047690>

my grad project was pretty zzz at least
wouldnt really ever want to work there, but the inside stuff was nice
visited the one in belgium a few times
power plants are kinda cool tbf
<:15min:655058014495047690>
something the engineers aint gonna do
there's still regular electricity stuff in a nuclear plant
yes?
like i said, belgium is really strict about this stuff
and depending on your company might take a while to get going to get it
which isnt something you get from school
besides the fact you're not even allowed in cabine's over here without the appropriate certification
as electrician
watching is extremely boring
so company is >watch only
household> you can actually do shit
bcs you dont have the qualification yet, nor did the requirement learning and stuff
they are really strict over here
which is the worst thing to do
you are not allowed to do anything besides watch
it is not
but company is the worst choice to pick from
you can pick here
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
the smell not so much
i like exploding capacitors
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>

~~its also a term generally used by the west~~
the word itself is fairly new (pitched around 2010's), what it entails isnt
which could be a lot of things
she's just salt incarnate
they would easily see if something doesn't add up like iski said
at work we have with the electricity company a negotiation to pay less then usual every month based on an average set amount kWh and let them use our companies property (roofs) for solar panels(it's scummy lol economics but legal) and you can be sure that every time there is a spike higher then the amount negotiated that they're sending someone to check the accountancy for unusual things.
it's pretty easy to see spikes
you just compare it to previous years?
i can believe that
getting myself an electric bike helped quite a bit for me to not get sweaty at all
i still bike to work bcs I'm too lazy to buy a car
same
~~so not really anything different then amateur procyclists that think the roads are theirs~~
<:teedus:774534056594767882>
worst case is i just use moms car, or dads car, or aunts car or sis's car
can't do that here but its like a significant amount I'm getting extra a month which is always nice to get.
oh right I also get paid to ride a bycicle to work which is also partly why i haven't bought a car.
the guy who literally lives next to the workplace (straight 100m walk) here still takes the car every day lol
same but getting my ebike helped a lot. Only doing 23km a day though so not that much.
<:harold:595434251286085653>
do it in xdu raiden
so the same as usual for kadokawa
or most of the atelier series
i feel ya
it just feels weird to be a contract violation when she said she's happy at the wrong shrine
honestly i was under the impression the shrine stuff happened last year tbh. I remember reading about it way before.
at least they finally charged it, it's been 2 years
he's just another shitty person at the top
Kondo never wanted ufo to just be an anime studio and he succeeded at that
(bar this years kimetsu)
it brings in more money then their anime lol
yeah they own a certain cafe branch they use to sell merch of their shows on and cosplay events etc
not their anime department
and it was mainly from their cafe's
ye
but as kondo is the president of ufotable they also got charged with it
should be noted that Kondo did this, not ufotable itself
like people are gonna take it as covid vaccine (J&J) bad while for example  it could also happen on your tetanus shot.
yeah and rare cases caused by vaccines
they're testing my mom on g-b syndrome and she got pfizer
it can happen in like any vaccine tbf
it took 9 months to release the first major patch as opposed to 3-4months on average they had in prev expacs.
you need to release stuff to keep your players interested
eh she got shafted either way <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
#5 in the lawsuit
To protect her financial interests in these box office receipts, Ms. Johansson obtained from Marvel a valuable contractual promise that the release of the Picture would be a “wide theatrical release.”  Both parties, as well as Disney, understood this meant that the Picture would initially be released exclusively in movie theatres, and that it would remain exclusively in movie theatres for a period of between approximately 90 and 120 days.
yes
```Marvel Chief Counsel Dave Galluzzi promised a traditional theatrical bow, while adding “We understand that should the plan change, we would need to discuss this with you and come to an understanding as the deal is based on a series of (very large) box office bonuses.”```

doesn't look the discussion happened
<:Wakaru:834568786383994881>
but yeh doing 3 years of evil things and think to be an equal of the jailer (which really is just thanos wow version) only to turn around when he said she's gonna be a slave is pretty eh
tis teldrassil but yeh basically that for a short summary
which happened after the writer switch for sylvanas
the morally grey comments are from bfa
it's not good writing but it doesn't have anything to do with mels comment
you do though
and here i thought you were gonna post post legion sylvanas which is where they started writing her dumb stuff

and they to still get paid jackshit
they are the owner then too
doesn't work when studio's are on a committee too
they also get paid per cut
heck even in house artists at other anime studio's dont get paid/hour
freelancers get paid per cut
they don't get paid per hour
then work on your posting <:15min:655058014495047690>

and make a world record of not having a government
imagine talking nuclear energy when you could talk about cities
its been an issue for over 50 years <:LUL:545650745534447631>
3 neighbouring cities that are separate but gov want to make them one.
the biggets pain point here is BHV
yeah but this a minority so if the big ones like blackrock and vanguard dont follow doubt anything is even gonna change.
a bunch of shareholders are calling kotick and some of the board to resign btw
and she also got paid less then her male co-leader in the same position (even though kotick himself said earlier that they'll change that)
she also resigned
the activision post was a response about the new female co-leader of blizzard calling him out on shit
~~my job tho~~
lo my bro's workplace pays like 30 bucks/h  for electricians and they can't fill holes either.
maybe not really the timing for it but people probably knew that the oshiete galko-chan author has been missing for over a week. He got arrested on suspicion of importing cp books from Germany. (they also found 46 of them at his home)
<:nani:241228065357824001>
you never know :^)
but its also the reason why i keep everything on physical drives too
you shouldn't really trust any provider then
also hosted
so
how are you gonna get files to someone else
its just ease of convenience
not like i can get to discord in the first place
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
and can't mail the files bcs too big
they had a cyber attack last year so now all usb ports are blocked and only mouse/kb work
so gotta use cloud
the worst part so far is that i can't make physical backups anymore on my backup drive for my work shit
hp just sends us new toners if we should replace them
same
<:15min:655058014495047690>
the printers are outsourced so hp themselves refill whenever
we dont have to look after that
it;s just eh windows
cs we are not allowed to do it ourselves :^)
it took them 5 months to disable sleep mode on laptop too
no not really
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
it took them 7 months to enable our printer again
that's too high tech for our IT service here rady
they have their internal ones but also use microsoft cloud services
work here uses a mix
like when your job uses cloud services
sometimes you dont have a choice
which are also illegal
you cannot play d2 anymore even if you have the discs
but they can and blizzard did that
it's enough of an issue that people end up quitting for it
causing them to just quit and do another job bcs no human is able to deal with that day in and day out.
better pay and less overworking isnt really gonna help the other problem they have called Qanon and antivaxxers who make their day miserable
and healthcare at least over here has been understaffed even before this
lots also quit during these 2 years
that's what the pill version exists for, a bit late but better then never.
yer lockdown doesn't mean much when you just go to the next country to do stuff.
would probably help if they stopped crossing borders to belgium to shop and buy food.
but seriously, my mom keeps asking every month when i'm changing jobs lmao
but we're also like undermanned
nah usually never
the government even mandated something like a shitty 0.04% increase in wage for companies that got record years and even that they didnt want to give.
usually there's enough to keep it running
yeah we had enough of them this time around the plant had to close
~~going on a strike doesnt pay well~~
expecting them to try it again this year too
we got 500 euro and wage raise <:okay:330354891727962122>
I too would put it as an all time low when we actually had to go strike and shut down the plant for a day so execs could see how unhappy we were.
like they even did a survey over here and when the results  came in about happiness at the workplace it basically said, compared to previous years the results got a lot better for every workplace we own, except for animal nutrition where it got to an all time low.
it would cost them money
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
we actually got a record year in 2021, not that we ever saw anything from it.
lol
yeah we had to come in but desk people got to stay home
so didnt work for like anyone working in industry <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
we had mandatory work from home when applicable
we implemented it really dumb
same
and if they were still in line it sucks to be them
so the curfew was in place so people didnt go in after
yeah but that also caused a big line
people still need to be able to buy food
etc
food stores
night shops
the thing we call eh restaurants, hotels etc etc over here
all horeca was closed
they were closed
they did curfews here after the hours people are done with work, so they wouldn't  go to a pub to drink and instead go home
<:harold:595434251286085653>
~~ye she can give birth any given moment now~~
so its pretty stressy for her and her bf
but she's also pregnant
they got it approved in december so they can start building this year
yeh
also looks like stress looking at my sister
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
build a house on it later
no
so i can put it in my taxes
the first thing i'll do prolly somewhere within the next 10 years is just buy a plot
my bro and dad shower at work
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
so bathroom always free
I dont really have that problem, I shower after i get home from work an they know how i work
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
parents: Please be quiet, someone's already sleeping
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
moms saying the opposite  to bro, when you gonna start saving or else im throwing you out
i would have to buy my brothers and sisters share
but i also have a brother and a sister so they cant even give it to me
still gotta pay for it
well "given"
which is totally fair
all i need to do is pay my parents x amount of money for income
so i'm also staying at home rn
yep
ive also been thinking of moving out but prices for houses or apartments buying/renting is too high for a single person here
oh same
it certainly helps you save (sometimes)
havent bought one after old one broke down
i would be more tempted when i actually buy a new car <:LUL:545650745534447631>
i could earn more but money isn't everything and while current workplace does shitty things it's usually chill in my department.
not really tbh.
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
surely is easier in dutch where we just call them peter and meter <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
yes, sis did ask if i wanted to be a godparent? (idk the english exactly) but i passed for that so my mom could be one.
i'm happy for her
>the russian ambassador holds the UNSC presidency so he dissolved the meeting
lmfao
ukraine can't mortar the exclusion zone in chernobyl and the russian army is trying to go through there to breach Kyiv
its strategic
russians got chernobyl
russia still claims it hasn't lost any troops so not like the other side has any better claims too
probably talked about joining or not
both fin and sweden got invited to sit on the council earlier today
and finland was part of it so yeah he wants it
Putin wants all of to bring back the russian empire
and guess which 2 scand countries are targeted by putin too
https://twitter.com/fpleitgenCNN/status/1497519335350452231
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i would assume it's accepted as in received?
they're still in meeting i think
https://twitter.com/nexta_tv/status/1498638623125774339?t=OydLrBSI3yAPjBP77QaAAw&s=09
you say that as if its their first time this war
rude
<:harold:595434251286085653>
neonazi this neonazi that talk
putin just did a speech and it was eh
yes they're insane
seeing as they keep shooting on the plant and dont even let firefighters do their job
russia did the same thing in syria in 2014
yeh the no global net was already tested last year iirc
obv
they dont really feel all of the other sactions
Johhny from our group is russian and the only saction that's been really hurting them is the mastercard/visa block
yes it would have
they drove through and digged in the red forest
this would have happened even if they didnt shell
they didnt use any safety material
the shelling wasnt even the problem
you can
scales with server boost level i think
we db now
~~so are his skills to get botox~~
y
it was here
maybe not in italy
the 2011 one was pretty big on media ye
yeah i remember all 3 of those
but yeah i was a kid when he was pm
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
was gonna say i was alive during his reign but that would sound weird
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Berlusconi?
and macron won hard with french in other countries
le pen won hard in the french not france countries they own
she only had 42% of the votes
ye results
ofc
nieuwsblad, belgian paper
ye so we stick with regular newspaper
we have a sub to newspaper here but that doesn't include digital so we would need to pay another sub for digital
still do
could have said ash ketchum or conan or... too
after 2011
yeah her main focus has been on theatre instead of anime roles
they're going like eh 5+ times too
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
until that knife accident
akb takes it to the next level too
yes
its has never been confirmed  so eh it could be a yes or no
but for more reasons, health issues, scandals.
va's in japan are almost never just voice acting.
ye
<:wink:239129205147697152>
some of the most famous roles for  boys/guys are voiced by old hags that should have quit years ago
No unless he traded in his nationality for a japanese nationality then yes
Yeah also why the move never appeared again in the anime (same for fissure and magnitude)
Love it when they put cycling tourists aside tho, fuck those
Dangerous
Yeah my bikes assist cuts out at around 26km/h, just above the cutoff. There's an OC button on it but thats disabled.
Speedelecs were excempt from that rule for a few years
Its 25km/h if motorized here
Too much people were abusing them when they didnt need a license with lots of accidents as result
At least they made it so speedelecs require a driving license now
Well you're still bound by rules so if you break them you pay
Think thats the cheapest one too for biking here
And like an extra 10 bucks for paper work
55 euro fine if you get caught
Its enforced here
Can only use the sidewalk if you're walking with your bike in hand next to you
Its illegal using sidewalks here when biking, you do it on the bikelanes and if those arent there, you bike on the car lane.
They also found some sort of explosive device (ofc unless they mean the 9 barrel gun)
<https://news.livedoor.com/lite/article_detail/22471149/>
after 2 years
which still aren't fully open
not to the extreme of japan
but pixiv has a pretty bad trackrecord caring for the western side so i'm not expecting anything to happen
it's pretty bad stuff
yes and eithe replacing the head or just using an AI to make it look like a drawing.
i dont see why you wouldnt go on pixiv anyway, sure it's an issue that needs to be fixed but you have to actively look at those tags before pixiv even recommends them to you
Skeb biggest issue isnt mastercard/visa anyway
Its mainly a japanese platform but there's non japanese people on it too you can commission
Any kind of artist tbf
Mastercard still works cs i had a request accepted yesterday. Idk how long that will remain though ..
Nsfw and payment processors <:Pain_peko:899263021480812586>
If it ever comes that far
They posted a whole post on medium about it with some ways to try and circumvent them.
They would have to post the real names of the artists on the requests etc
Their bigger concern rn are the new japanese laws coming.
<:china:256139699356172289>
its like it never happened
RK author is writing more RK sequel btw, fenny
well japan has a pretty good track record for that lol
Its not drugs so you know how its gonna go
Rather pay 8 bucks for no ads then 8 bucks for half ads
cryptocurrency exchange platform
Shows like boruto (and new bleach) would outright die without twitter
Its the same for the jp side of twitter. There's so much contact happening for recruitment of animators both jp/foreigners through twitter.
<:PrAya:915524895478255636>
only when in a group
eh they dont
Cheap
https://puu.sh/Jurjp.png
lmfao but of course
so our turnouts are also high (they changed the ruling this year to not be forced anymore so we'll see what happens next election)
we have to go vote or go jail lol
Excuse me what
if you dont want to drive bcs it can kill you then i might as well stop doing my everyday job cs it can kill me.
^there's a thread on twitch safety forums asking to remove trans from the banlist for automod back in june 22 afaik
few more eps probably wouldnt hurt if people have time
they haven't found the way
trigger is lost <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
if something actually comes from this, I just want to say that budget is a meme and a pretty bad metric for how a show looks
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
a multimillion dollar company doesn't need a kickstarters of 15-30k dollar to gauge interest
well it doesn't and tbh
and people fall for them every time
same reason as why funi does kickstarters to gauge interest
they do and its just such a terrible scheme
their patreon is still the worst thing out of them.
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
pixiv and nitro plus also apparently
like goodsmile and bushiroad
usp is like 5 studio's and a handful of big industry players iirc
also short answer, they're part of ultra super pictures so no not indie
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
triggers best work and only had 15mins per ep to make it
but eh the original question was is trigger a indie studio
yep
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
luluco is the second best show they ever made
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
and ibo went to shit in s2
she had to shape the director ideas in well, useable ideas
she was brought on board 2 years after production started
she didn't even wrote it
no
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
see
but everyone hates her in the west
one of the current biggest script writers in anime
it's from okada
adaptations constraints their output too much
for good reason
oh was to ranger
no
and there's only one that's always on the committee except for their very first anime
trigger isn't one of them
there's 200 animation studio's and there's only like 10 that often are on a committee
like every anime ever
production committee
they got contracted for it
not like that matters much to trigger
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
yes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
shirobako but for voice cast instead
girlish number was nice
at ibo
on the other hand i was glad it wasnt another universal century timeline
same
but yeah granbelm is basically sd gundam mechs
||https://i2.wp.com/japandaman.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/granbelm-wp.jpg?fit=900%2C484||
<:harold:364119409620418591>
turn A gundam still best gundam
<:15min:495770478678638593>
well forgetting the whole plotpoint of jeanne'darc setup in s2 was not nice
s2 was eh whatever
ibo s1 was nice
it actually puts me off
sd gundams to be precise <a:15min:490152513623031809>
granbelm has mecha
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
eh i mean robotech
watch notmacross
yeah sore ga is also pretty great for that
Imber
its bad and not imas but the end gets me every time <:15min:495770478678638593>
i rewatch it once in a while
xenoglossia is a guilty pleasure tbh
they do a lot of other shows anyway
general consensus of people tends to be sunrise= mecha
yeah cosmi
bandai explicitly stated they want to rebrand sunrise into an original anime studio
they want sunrise to get rid of the sunrise only does gundam name
is not surprising
well its gaina now
well it is gainax on buster 3
it was different but i still liked it
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
how bad will gunbuster 3 be though
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
anime industry things is my jam ayamine
for whatever reason
thats just upscaled 1080p
they never used the actual 4k master for the 4k bd
<:15min:495770478678638593>
release the bd in 4k upscale the 1080p but dont use the 4k master
bd 1080p
theater screening 4k master
too bad they ruined everything about it
almost all gundam are political though
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
at least its easy enough to cheat with nail polish
i still don't like the neck plugs at least
they're doing fine now ye
frame arm girls that is
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
the only model kits i have are fags
<:15min:495770478678638593>
😄
too bad its from seed destiny
😄
i also like golden boy
agree with cosmi
seed <:reeee:309960719623782411>
<a:15min:585535690817798150>
yes hey
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
but its weird seeing 2000's designs in 2019
fafner is great <:reeee:309960719623782411>
<:WorstTimeline:451521970266177536>
who thought that releasing a fafner the beyond ep every few months was a good idea though
yeah
but IG port  was smart enough to keep majority of the departments and xebex zwei out of sunrise
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
and xebex got sold to sunrise
theres some at trigger still but most were xebex and sunrise
there's hardly any mecha animators left
which is natural evolution tbh
for mecha
they arent gonna do 100% 2d anymore
sunrise is also switching
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
can we get an F for xebex though
which was sort of a collab
you probably got confused bcs of franxx
technically cloverworks now
imas staff works at A1 not trigger
nah
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
im going to finish the fags first
haha
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i still need to  start on my muv luv kits
i have one sitting at 50% build that i havent worked on for a good few months now
you're likely only setting up 1 ep
in batch you still need to setup every ep to reencode
well he needs top first
the bigger problem i've heard from people that read it that they skipped all of the prologue
that will be hard
that wasnt realkly their fault tbh
i havent seen konosuba or care for it but same
it works really well to up the comedy
at least it was intentional for konosuba
if you look at future seasons <:15min:495770478678638593>
they didnt change staff for konosuba so yeah
not counting konosuba bcs thats just really deen staff at jc staff
milf isekai, danmachi, accel and machikado mazoku
<:15min:495770478678638593>
we're also having 4 jc staff anime this season so that will be fun
there's jsut been shitty behind the scenes stuff at jc staff messing everything up
JC staff generally is fine with 4 projects a season actually
yeah i dont think wanting to finish OT in 1 2cour was a good idea
👌
healthy is like 3-5key animators on 1 ep
yeah arm because the more key animators the worse it gets
they did delay to up the quality
in this case
well arm was right
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
ari actually has less key animators listed
yeah
18 key animators on the first ep is very crazy
It's not like XV is doing so well on that department either <:15min:495770478678638593>
while we're talking this
yep
yeah they help out on the production
yeah now its just white fox helping out instead of being the main studio
likely
popular enough to not get cancelled <:15min:495770478678638593>
he fucked it and he fucked it over
mind you, he's still complaining its not good
<:obama:439779824299540491>
hard to restart
author complained, committee decided to change staff
they had episodes finished
the staff change is what hit them the most anyway
as long they dont delay or outright cancel it like a certain show they will probably be fine
but yeah like its only really the cgi thats super awful, the rest looks like your average low quality bait anime <:15min:495770478678638593>
there's better ways to do it then megalo box
if you want good digital effects just watch ufotable shows <:15min:495770478678638593>
they do but ever since the K movie they have been fucking around with digital effects to the extreme
W'z
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but it got a sequel of sorts
its was mainly a visual disaster
yeah but they had the basic down for that really
time flies
or was it 2016
<a:15min:490152482429861898>
then you get berserk 2017
moths later realizes they were actually right
just ignores what they say and call them shit
have your staff tell you for months that what he wants rendered it soo time consuming because they dont have the hardware for it.
but usually its either bad studio management or  production committee shenigans
berserk  was actually the director's fault for a change <a:15min:490152463555624991>
pretty much
most still work freelance
pretty much
i have s1 downloaded
just dont feel like watching  it
oh i know
that was Bandai pushing for it to air soon instead of giving them time
they're probably working on that and fairy gone second half next season
not that i know
https://puu.sh/DTVD1.jpg
no
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
that what they did for megalo box
"old school look"
upscale the 480p to 1080p
> mater in 1080p >rescale to 480p
araburu, danmachi 2, granbelm, fate waver, accel, arifureta, dummbell, restage and ofc geah is what im watching of newly started anime
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
you should for the removed arc
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
do it for kyoani
you should undrop it and finish
ay
that remind me of needless
<:WorstTimeline:451521970266177536>
https://puu.sh/DVjVD.png
bcs i dont remember any of them
but when you have stuff like aikatsu which has a billion ops/eds and different seasons  it gets hard to guess for me
96 entries
so liek eh
every music anime i've seen
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i still dont remember my short list
nah yor
so there arent 2000shows i need to remember <a:15min:490152416751386624>
i just made a separate list for amq
^
what the anime actually fucks up on is ||the lights memories||
i would love to see it animated but the first part we get in clannad is more then enough for me
its also <:zardespair:551831170137194496>
but yeah 4chapters is a pretty quick read
the vn also has eh porn elements unlike clannad
same but clannad tomoyo after wasnt licensed in english iirc
nah fan tl
~4chapters
if you dont want to read the vn for it there's a manga based on it
tomoyo arc is real fucking sad
god bless your soul if you never saw the full arc of that
no
<:nani:241228065357824001>
i should replay clannad vn
yes solo you heard it right
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i dont watch anime on phone
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah
i need the api for this https://taiga.moe/
i have no idea
mal is now useless for me because i need the api to update my shows
well mal api stil ldoesn't work so
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i havent actually rated all of my old shows unless i rewatched it
zoids <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:15min:241820657027907584>
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
its always awful
<:harold:364119409620418591>
I posted my message at noon
I use anilist
<@238855496797257729> anilist, kitsu
saki is a great read
so that other girl can make the same hand in her match
one of the girls make another girl on her team orgasm when she makes big hand plays
well in saki they all have like bullshit powers
there's also the fanmade symphogear cardgame
yeah
weiss swarchz thing
yea
same
<:harold:364119409620418591>
i can't look at phos since the last chapter
pls no phos
yeah around that
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
and insert stuff from v17 and above so anime only watcher literally dont know whose who
but that aint gonna happen and they ahd that perfect chance with the movie but nah gotta original
tbh v8 is supposed to fix most of that animewise
the removal of tetsuya's thoughts is the worst offense ever done
gate is written by an ex-JSDF
the anime even tried to remove most traces
considering the eh actual source
GATE was pretty tame actually
yeah i know
ill stick to the ln <:15min:495770478678638593>
mahouka anime is pretty trash
it's not confirmed as long they dont announce it
just checked and they didn't help produce a single show this season
<:15min:495770478678638593>
didn't feel right so they made that a movie and did things melua doesnt like
the original plan was dissapearance
both
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
and doesn't listen to his own staff
an example of what happens when your director is a brick
berserk 2017 is also a good example
whether they're on the committee or not
depends tho
bad schedule isn't JC staff fault in the first place
they also had a year for mob
accelerator is the entry with different staff unlike other  toaru
index 3 and railgun S would be better bcs they actually share the same character designer
gee different character designers
it's more like
so its hard to compare
well yes it's cgi, the work flow was completely different then a normal cgi anime
but for your illustrious example
random cgi would be less noticable with better composite
3d enabled lots of stuff
tbh no but it depends on what you use it for
I could agree
I love that op btw
<:harold:364119409620418591>
October 8
2040
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
now i just watch the movie
```That out of order order was so weird and bananas back in the day lol```
I loved it tbh
I actually dropped the nagato based anime.
~~thanks satelight~~
reminder that everything is shuffled around
it's also the only thing that's actually chronologically on the original airing
I know that i would never want to watch it weekly again
I don't hate it tho
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
it's 5.5 eps too long
there /is/ a difference but that wasn't the point
yeah
it probably had mainly to do with the fact that they had to record everything again for each ep
```i like owning animes I super enjoyed```
yup same
oof
I went original and then rewatch for ep25
which I watched but missed the movie
yeah ep 25 was released on the rebroadcast
might be the sequel i was thinking about
ill have to hunt that down, don’t think i saw that one
I just saw that also
I thought they announced one last year, lemme check
🤔
Weren't we getting a sequel
https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/berserkpostprocessing2.mp4

something like this btw arma?
mecha animator is a dying breed
and sunrise is 50/50 between handdrawn and 3d
so does xebec
actas has some
ufotable is also 90% in house so don't have to outsource cgi
you just do 2 in 1
they do it straight in Maya or whatever else program a studio uses
cgi normally skips the storyboarding for the most part
and then cgi renderered over it, with every close up also being handdrawn
illustrious was first fully storyboarded traditionally
for Japan only, ignoring overseas for a moment
but the stats show that what's lost in bd sales is actually made up with digital
people also go bd sales which ofc lower each year
yep
it's still netflix
first time for Netflix in november which is nice but eh
30%US and EU
China is like 70% of the overseas revenue
ye
even when the rest pretty flopped
same thing happened with kakegurui with netflix buying out the license for big bucks
license brought in enough money to push for a sequel
which probably happened with hand shakers lol
I know people are yadayada crunchy and stuff but selling streaming licenses brings in more money then selling bds or merch for majority of the shows
your point still stands tho
hao is chinese
yeah
except that gohands is japanese and the former Osaka branch of Satelight
it had a bazillion its ending copouts tho
since this year
I remember liking it but that's bout it
<:harold:364119409620418591>
why?
yes
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
yeah i have the material notes on hand somezhere but that requires looking
the truck one?
he excels against the normal kind of goblins
they have a specific name
the huge ones arent goblins either
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I should rewatch shirobako tbh
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
or what goes on in the industry
nah i like this sort of stuff tbh but majority of anime watchers generally won't care about people behind an anime
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
I only know dumb stuff like this
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
<:ShirabeThink:416318747914141696>
~~why i always buy in bulk~~
10 euro book, 25euro shipping <:harold:364119409620418591>
conversion rates don't exist for this <:15min:495770478678638593>
wherever is cheapest for you
yeah then just buy on nobles or amazon
if its official depends if you want physical or digital tbh
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
ilvl is pretty skewed nowadays
you wont replace your items until the final 2 lvls or so with blues
<:smug:239129154061205505>
~~doesnt work for current wow~~
<:KagawaLife:404519449828392960>
lol the emotes
so I'm glad they changed dad story
and i dont want nanoha to suffer even more
like nanoha is suffering and the things that happened to her dad was really suffering
not just for that
and good they did <:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
as long it's not force
I'll take anything
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
DD is just one of those nanoha universes
same creator after all
~~dog days~~
it fits at the ep it was in but not for the overall tone of the show
to what its supposed to be like
you should also mention they changed all that stuff for the actual release
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
funi would have probably done the same
but tbh
that was gkids
that wasnt funi
its quite different
they did it before they decided on their current style
just watch manabi straight for actual good ufotable content <:15min:495770478678638593>
ive been reading the lns lately and how they go through the story is different enough already starting from v1
but yeah the naime takes the general story and thats it
they did release a vol21 based on the notes of the author but its not the same as him actually writing it
let alone its forever unfinished
but not like there will ever be a proper adaptation of the show
not liek that still doesnt happen now
yeah
pretty sure it did alright
unlike originals liek geah
louise is also based on a ln so easier to get sequels
well it was another style
<:15min:495770478678638593>
both kyoani and ufotable do the most things inhouse
they're not that different in that aspect
there's a few publishers that banned isekai entries already
nah the dude/girl got isekaied as a vending machine
samew
just wait on the isekai with a vending machine
im just gonna stick to the vn for yuno
same
"author"
we know we said that
yeah its the isekai arc atm
26 yeah
the BDs actually look pretty good
the airing yeah
yes
and hatena is also getting anime iirc
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
like marchen something
fiasco's aside
at least its nice that the authors other works are also getting anime adaptations
the main part is that louise is actually tolerable unlike in the anime <:15min:495770478678638593>
<a:15min:490152508757508106>
too bad they didnt
if only people cracked the code to sell
brb dinner
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
so he reincarnated as merlin
monogatari and overlord aren't counted as lns but novels
there are exceptions ofc
pocket sized
They're pretty small
and to take with you
They're easy to consume
<:15min:495770478678638593>
instead of the 90s
airing in the wrong year
too bad we have yuno right now
I don't know where i left off tho
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
a bit ye
he looks op for an anime only viewer tho
same
before they get back to those 3 after a few eps
which would be the focus instead of izayoi and co
at the point they would adapt they introduce more people iirc
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
bcs it would start with a complete new cast
a s2 would be weird as fuck
but back to mondaji for a second
in alicization
kirito being transported to yet another gameworld is pretty isekai
<:15min:495770478678638593>
alicisation is more isekai then s1
but tbf
what aya said
it's not
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
the ln is bad enough anyway
yeah not sure if the wn is tld
the anime is tame
the anime is glorious nippon jsdf crancked up to 3
the ln is glorious nippon jsdf crancked up to 9
glorious nippon jsdf crancked up to 11
yes its the original
you should hunt down the webnovel version
its not wrong
imagine getting fired bcs you slipped it <:15min:495770478678638593>
its not official till its actually announced
it was a guy at a panel
there hasnt been official confirmation though
(yet)
well tbh that was mentioned but there hasnt been any actual confirmation
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
yeah
and if the concert stages reminds you of gear or vica versa, they're done by the same guy
yep
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
bless satelight
<:15min:495770478678638593>
shit that works in manga doesnt inherently work in anime
you should be palying to the strengths of a medium
monster is an example of how not to do anime anyway
its just a copy/paste of manga panels frame per frame for the most part
good anime trash adaptation
have you ever seen monster?
instead of just 100% straight adaptation
they fit in original things and play around with the source material using how anime should be used as a medium
a source
they dont straight adapt
i mean thats what you should have for kyoani anime anyway lol
from the ones that come from their own label that is
every kyoani anime is half original <:15min:495770478678638593>
so like the best is gone
sleepy girl, shibutani are all anime originals
different
i dont personally think it is but ive only read half of the first one
same for the most part
that i can't answer, i only took a quick look after ren finished to see what was up
yeah
s1 is mostly original and stuff with satone removed
like s2 is pretty much the source
but they removed her
satone is the actual mc and should have been in s1
they shot themselves in the foot with chuunibyou for the most part
chuunibyou anime is weird to begin with
~~ i would actually want a 20th Century Boys adaptation though~~
unless he magically changed over the past few years
its either 100% follow the source or you dont get anime
urasawa is notorious for not letting people do their jobs
and it should be copy/paste again
yes
its just a goup of "mangaka"
always been 4 no
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
but before that it was 11
so basically clamp that mattered has always been 4
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
discotek is good
and then snatch it for like 20 or 30 bucks
i already have the boxset so im gonna wait for a sale
standard 13 ep season pricing
60bucks probably?
so i hope it does well for them so they can pick up the follow ups
they're releasing it next year on bd in the west
s1 is licensed by discotek
did you forget?
it was announced so
soon™
s1 next year
yeah
aniplex uses the jp pricing
aniplex beats all of them for pretty much anything besides tl quality
besides an overuse of tl notes lately
but for the rest they tend to be fine
if its jennifer or something thats in credits as tl (not lead) then the subs are horrid
sentai depends on who'se tling it
yes ayamine they're pretty bad
weird choices for artwork
jalter also  , cu zerker, dantes
ill take it
has random mashu art
> artbook for HF2
```Walking along, flip-flop.
An empty head sways to and fro.
Vacating all the nitty-gritty objectives.
Trembling, shimmy-shimmy and a go-go.
Singing, tee-hee and a go-go.
Dried-out limbs, just like paper balloons,
roll around the ground, tumble-tumble.
Huff-puff, floating and flying
is when you become an adult.
Go-go.
Go-go.
Go-go.
Someone is coming by, squeak-squeak.
A laughter, cackle-cackle-cackle-cackle.
I don't remember fascinating you at all.
Because they echo so loudly,
scritch-scratch
-the tummy started to rumble-rumble.```
lmao the "poem"on the backsite of the artbook
fancy artbook in it
i should grab the materials book for movie 2 one of these days from the ufotable site
<https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/376517212347039755/614445815460790289/DSC_0317.JPG> with bonuses
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bds so aniplex subs
well fate arrived finally so time to watch
its less girls but still one of the better ones
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
just start with futari precure
i havent bought my own tv yet
nice
i dont have my surround system installed sadly enough
yeah
already had satisfaction with the punch early on in the movie
that was the icing
at the shinji end <:15min:495770478678638593>
i had to pause for dinenr at the perfect time
reminds me HF2 was pretty good
and no action
same but better
just watch yuru yuri
<:15min:241820657027907584>
when singing
yukachi is re-enacting mako in it
rip
good content
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W8c_gLSNS70
sleepy head
the name you want is mako btw
yes
from geah
its miku
her va is yukachi
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
yukachi
~~least it knows how to juggle a massive cast~~
watch it before you even touch the movie
the battle they had to skip in the anime
the ova introduces the anzio
in return
but they added 20mins runtime
and the movie was delayed for a year
the last ep was also delayed to march
not even that
```our sponsor Bandai literally came to us and said, "We want at least five new mobile suits in this series. And as long as their model kits sell...```
```All they said is, "We want five mobile suits, and we want those five mobile suits to be so spectacular that they sell a lot of merch, and that's it."```
blame bandai <:15min:495770478678638593>
thats pretty much all gundam <:15min:495770478678638593>
the movie is peak gup
<:15min:241820657027907584>
rude
~~gup is the best thing that graced us besides geah in the last decade, sue me~~
hehe
movie is is in spring 2020
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
~~contiminated by worms~~
already an improvement <a:15min:585535690817798150>
at least the sex scene felt better then in fsn and ubw
their recent kits are better then their older ones at least
yeah
frame arm girls <:15min:495770478678638593>
but not before i finish the fag kits and the muv luv kits i still need to build
one day ill get a gundam kit
you can just replace the 5 with any number and you get every gundam
so actual gundams
that was about gundam wing specific iirc
and story and characters
its bandai tellign sunrise how many mobile suits they want
thats literally every gundam show tho
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
most just skip it
monologues in anime are an iffy thing
ye
for the movies at least
its just a good example of how to adapt
so good
and the ro aias just after
that was <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
i have the bd somewhere actually
<:hyp:250363576005558272>
most of it was bad but there were a few good things
hey ast least it had a few good scenes
lmao
the dragon was still the best fate thing they gave us
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
there so much theoretical stuff they could do
showcasing shirou becoming archer
doing an original series
from like
nothing stops them
there had to be compromises
so i cant blame amrados
most of illya's shlick is cut from the movie
most people in ytt are trying to attend physically
spring 2020 for HF3 is still pretty broad tho
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
good thing sympholive might also be in spring next year
<:15min:495770478678638593>
http://i.imgur.com/QWWISvi.jpg
the princess got it worst tbh
this one also looked better for s2
https://66.media.tumblr.com/40d9ff37464b5730423136a29a491e2c/tumblr_nczcr1qhlq1ttxnrmo4_r1_1280.jpg
depending on the char its not that bad tbh
they switched the key people
yeah
lmao
as long you dont do drugs, you mostly will be fine
i mean almost no jail and house arrest is not what you usually get in other countries for tax evasion
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
all he can do is write
well he has house arrest
as far as i know he's still writing
not even exposition
most of it there wasnt anything happening
they could cut that at least in half
too much focus on the kids halfway through iirc
s2 was still worse
even that aside
aoi, nana etc
i just cant play p5 dubbed with that all star japanese cast
and theyre generally the better dubs
bang zoom worked for netflix before and so did nyav post
netflix still outsources dub to other studios hence i was asking
or did it suffer from a random dub from netflix
nyav post?
who did the dub
<:toot:585598637061439488>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
track elizabeth
watch it
the trailer spoiling what should have been a twist
you klnow what actually annoys me
then like not enough filling
better that tbh
which was a big disappointment
lowkey interested bcs ito is personally involved unlike with the ito collection series we just had
yea
> aoi and aoi sang preserved roses
looking at setlist for anisama day 3
<:kappa:271347291934294037>
Yoko pls
waiting on the digests and bds gonna be so hard
<:harold:364119409620418591>
not again
~~guess we can also add that one to the short list of getting 2 seasons at once announced~~
shield hero got s2 and s3 announced
yeah that might be a little too much
very
yeah they are
its an account that criticizes what people say about shield hero
<:15min:495770478678638593>
@ShieldHeroTakes
god bless your soul for not having seen that one shield hero twitter
~~and has amazon money~~
it's still in a high profile manga publisher
jump can risk that
not really
we suffered enough
no
it generally is ye
blame cr for shield hero <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
i can believe the wiki actually said the thing about the boobs tbh
its in both the official manga and a keyword
Issei should be hard work
kirito does actually work hard <:suhaha:585983562478780416>
they all have luck and hard work
you could just remove the titles and put them all under a same one
who would put things on the same page as ft
thats actually an insult
<:monkaS:391991730486116352>
> BC
monogatari doesnt really have an in between
you either like it or you dont
thats a fair thing tbh
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
yeah
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
the teeth brushing scene was pretty tame for monogatari standards even
if you think its just boring talk
then it just sounds like that monogatari isnt for you
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
just give them slam dunk
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they are tho
it still gonna be a preference
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
big dick mecha urobutcher style
he's busy again with his new project as usual
uro isnt involved iirc
but im not gonna watch it
someone i know is the producer for it
last year
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1H4o18U1MLM
at least from trailers
yes
its just new cast
and s3 doesnt even focus on the old cast
s2 was pure trash
s1 was good, movie was aight
i have 0 trust in PP
seven deadly sins
it doesnt have akane
dont bother
are they?
which hopefully wont be as rushed as s3
souma also next season
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
not that i read the epilogue and the arc before
SDS is fine tbh
<:smug:239129154061205505>
sds next season by deen tho
just drop the series, it wont
it gets better
if someone tells you
they picked it up to 3-5 chapters for the final season
they had a pace of 2 chapters an ep
FT is slow all around anime wise
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
im just wisely gonna ignore  what he's saying
its just a rec
no idea
listening to ell melloi ost yesterday was a mistake
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
lots of fate
https://puu.sh/EhV2T.jpg
but
actually unrelated
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
you are too focused on designs
idk
but it probably wouldnt have been as good
it might have still been good
and arent just doing it to put bread on the table
its always ncie to have staff that really care about a project
yes thats good
they'll put more care into it and stuff
and it shows
HxH (2011) just had people behind it that really like it
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
HxH isnt even that good
an actual good tales game
they should have just given us a berseria anime
the best zestiria eps were the eps from berseria
<:15min:495770478678638593>
good animation can't save bad games
the guy tling it had to do notes on every ep to actually explain the jokes for western people
joshiraku is also a show that focuses on rakugo but more heavily comedy focused
and culture
amongst other things
rakugo actually requires you to understand japanese history
you are wrong
you just can't simply translate rakugo in english
yes but that doesnt change the loss in translation
and you would pages of tl notes to actually explain everything properly
its just ahrd to understand rakugo bcs its a very japanese thing
the problem with rakugo is, well rakugo
and even that is soemthing i wouldnt watch
rakugo is easily the best show deen made in years
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
at least for konosuba it was intentional
i wonder if there's a clannad comparison
but i agree with melua though
so did I
yes
but hey <@!99695384296701952>  at least kyoani still looks the best out of the 3 🤣 
https://i.stack.imgur.com/GH0u0.jpg
what
they both have a lot of trash
same thing <:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
they kept too much on the KEY visuals
its fair
kanon 2002
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
thats deen
thats not kyoani
im out
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
yeah you just dont know what the fuck you talk about
>bad https://i.imgur.com/digfn.jpg
>good https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/demonslayer-anime/images/2/22/Tanjiro_Kamado_first_appearance.png/revision/latest?cb=20190523224340
yeah you're just talking shit visual wise
so they redid the art with the new artist
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
actually reprinted v1-7 with new art because artists changed at v8
iirc yes
at least it has charlotte <:15min:495770478678638593>
i had an urge to watch trash
<a:15min:490152463555624991>
infinite stratos
and now its time to rewatch the first ep of the densest main character that ever existed in anime
exceptions exist™
~~and if you have to use tl notes you failed as a translator~~
ok not that extreme but it would be a lot of text
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but every second of a 25min ep
just imagine that solo
~~same guy doing geah for commie~~
<:smug:239129154061205505>
someone more insane then kawakami
6 volumes out
Yen press has them
at least do 2 volumes <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
rokka had to drag shit out so hard
that also just did 1 volume
that sounds like rokka
<:15min:495770478678638593>
186chapters in 12 eps
well you could ask zetman
ok it wasnt actually the start but when there were only 5 precure series at said time it actually made it easier
<:smug:239129154061205505>
~~the nice thing watching it since the very start is that you dont have to worry about this~~
yeah hugtto had crossover eps bcs of the precure anniv to be precise
a few are sequel but they're all stand alone
every season is 49 eps
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
author once again wrote a whole original volume for it
which is pretty nice
theyre releasing boxset for s1 and 2
yeah
tfw no s3
and also fucking good
but yeah horizon is crazy
movie announced for YAiba
yea
its one of his original projects
<:smug:239129154061205505>
bcs yuruyuri mangaka created the designs
endro is def on the border
unless you find it cute? i guess <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
yeah and neither are it really
endro falls more in line with it but i wouldnt call it a pure cgdct either
spyce is too action focused to be tbh
true you could probably just read it
<:smug:239129154061205505>
didn't index explain that already anyway
s3 yes
depends on how its tackled
so not like it was wrong
yeah but your last line is why they aren't working on it either way
its just actas
3hz isn't working on the movies
>boruto im looking at you
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
he's actually writing it himself
what actually matters
you know
yea
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i mean he also reused plue in ft
ive read 2 chapters
from rave to ft to ez
all his chars look alike
eden's zero
no idea i forgot
his new one
which name i forgot
either that or the other manga
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:smug:239129154061205505>
they didnt feel as good in the manga
yea
voice acting did a lot heavy lifting
actually worked better in anime
and the fights while still as short as the manga
<:15min:495770478678638593>
bcs they finally figured out how pacing works
final season was better then the rest
yeah
now if only OP would end
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
another show on my list completed
yeah good shit
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
but it takes more skill to intentionally sing false
it takes skill to sing
is haruhi meme op
the worst of it all
but the worst
just search for suwawa live singing
still better then most of aqours
nozomi was one of the weaker singers in LL
rie can sing though
sunshine?
far
ofc its always like that
lmao thats nice
heh
never bothered with the spinoff myself
lmao
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ayJdEzhqQ0I
you got a spinoff <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
but thats personal opinion either way
i like it
🤣
she plays in effing Im@s
do you really think rie cant sing?
wait
pls
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
why not both
but god do i love the show
to the point where the whole animation pretty much burned up so it looks pretty rough
just because also puts it towards the end but i can forgive it in that show bcs the character acting is so strong
that reason is also why i like tsuki ga kirei so much
extremely dumb
i dropped GT at ||banri ghost||
i switched from a lot of action to a lot more sol over the years
i actually enjoy them more now
<:smug:239129154061205505>
slice of life and a subgenre of it
sol, ishiyakei, comedies
these kind of shows just help me after a day of work
```Ah yes that opening  Probably the most I like the show lol```
we can stay friends then <a:15min:490152508757508106>
tv sized
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=03x0bU2w9HI
at least agree that the OP is an absolute banger
bandai released the manga for LS and they shut down their manga department years and years ago
i also have the manga but we're never gonna get more volumes released <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
i liked LS
sugita <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
our one and only <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Gotouza-sama is her nick
guess the guy
that everyone now uses
and there's a certain guy who gave her a nickname
whho also plays in lucky star
the voice actor for mikuru is yuko gotou
so fun fact
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ecqXcO42JK8
not the spin-off hence ggoa
bcs when people say ggo they refer to the ggo arc in sao
i liked it
that just means it failed as an anime
they could do that wrestler isekai that just started airing that also comes from konosuba author
there's a second uncomfirmed isekai joining
it's not just shield hero
and the rem focused eps
beutelgeuse eps were my fav eps by far
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
betelgeuse is
rem isnt best girl
actually im wrong
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8d3bW42aFY
ye
but just replace it with best
that sounds like a cool, cooler, coolest
agree to disagree
<:15min:241820657027907584>
rem is best <:15min:495770478678638593>
cypher
ice what
what
good popcorn anime
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i never found it good, just liked it
better then shield hero at the least
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i liked rezero till the end
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
now wait
its just hey this is getting anime
no date iirc
that name reminds me of a manga with a similar name
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
🤔
can emilia heal empty wallets
nah lmao
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
its only 100 bucks i could have been spending on food
<:harold:364119409620418591>
i never got out
<:smug:239129154061205505>
i see market is doing its job
everything is a .....
he's in the last half yea
the saint <:15min:495770478678638593>
the movie at least had a clear focus so it was much much better
kc anime tried to do many things at once
ironically yes
~~also more bds to import~~ <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
too bad v8 is gonna get skipped again
then again animating inner monologues can be pretty <:eeh:242112096584728576>
i had a lot of fun with tatsuya inner monologue in the lns which doesnt exist in the anime
im actually not that fond of it anime wise
!!!
yes
so pretty much a 13 ep series
straight to visitors arc v9-11
🤢
>skipping v8
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
time for more oniisama
mahouka s2 announced
only really beaten by sao
it has been outselling index for ages
mahouka didnt really need it
ended like a few hours ago
last announcemnt they made
dengeki festival
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
granted he can't actually have emotions
in the anime he looks like that emotionless brick
tatsuya is much more bearable in the ln bcs you can read his thoughts so to say
which the anime is completely void of
explaining stuff, general tatsuya thoughts etc etc
there's a lot of monologues in the ln
its meh yes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the good news is that YP released just enough volumes to cover s2
with an atrocious pace
yen on publishes it yes
🤣
and hearing onii-sama i guess
the lns is where its at
the anime isnt exactly amazing
he's not wrong
the movie doesnt make that much sense if you hadnt read the novels already
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
but the movie has character that will be formally introduced in s2
that wasnt meant to be in caps
WELL ITS A HARD WATCH FOR NEWCOMERS
v6 or v7
its original but it takes place between v11 and v16
yes and no
there was a movie in 2016
....
same staff as the movie btw
its more, onii-sama
nononono
yes
pretty sure the anime explained it
things you do for love
it actually started making sense towards the end
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
so the start of final season of shana was actually a big wtf moment
i never actually read the novels for it
shana <:MariaHappy:497711649973862410>
Dammit aya
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
so they can schedule for NT
s3 just looks like that they wanted to finish OT asap
but the west is shouting doom and gloom saying the adaptation sucks
like japan doesn't care
the index thing just sounds like such a western thing tbh
i usually also have to double take
cant blame you for that
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
i havent been keeping up with the index NT
from >1million+ copies to 300-500k
index had a hard drop regardless
and sao was the same
index v1 i got had stretched out art and gray tones instead of black
actually has black as black
i just bought the jp volumes
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i bought 1 vol of sao and one vol of index and threw them away
and its really fucking shit
black is gray
the image colors are washed out
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
did they get a better printer yet
considering you buy yen press
but no english lns <:15min:495770478678638593>
i just buy if i really like it
i do a bit of everything collection <:15min:495770478678638593>
i rewatch with dubs sometimes but never on the first watch
ive never really been a dub watcher so never had that happen
i see, i see
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
the author (who was penning the anime scripts) removed that part in the anime
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
lul
the ln shows the name of the first true beast in the first volume which is what leads up to volume 4 and v5
the first true beast
so actually adapting up to v4(second half) and v5 wouldnt have made sense
and the author retconned something in v1 for the anime
of v4
the firts half isnt that important tbf
well they skipped the last 2 volumes
<:15min:495770478678638593>
its official author naming so
<:15min:495770478678638593>
ctholly*
yes?
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
but i dont like reading digital
the digital volumes i got from my bro later dont have that problem
so i feel like its actually a yp printer problem
granted its still like 300 bucks total for all the bd volumes anyway
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
it was included with the jp bds
<:smug:239129154061205505>
~~i have the storyboard for that scene~~
like when it played in ep 1
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i could have posted a worse one
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6aoe8mBbevU
hey cypher
<:panic:282277202995970048>
last volume came out lat year in decvember
its 7 volumes atm
it is
im not sure if YP picked up moka
fantl i think there was someone working on it?
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and not actually give us sukamoka anime
the part that actually feels bad is that they put quite a bit of focus on the kids
its not really an epilogue tbf
sort of?
yes moka is
<:15min:495770478678638593>
there's more and a sequel ln
not sure if ill keep watching it though
that one got some good chuckles out of me
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and buy the jp volumes
learn japanese,
there is a way
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
but actually seeing it would hurt more
def
that would really hurt
at least its not the actual scenes
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntqxI9I6Opo
you can be super good and still put out shit work just because they dont have the time
they do but eh
it looks fine
they generally skip most of the storyboarding process
animewise that is
cg is interesting tbh
you might be able to draw but that doesn't mean you can animate
reverse is also true
drawing is cool but its not animation <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
majority is tablet now instead of paper but strictly speaking its the same thing, they just remove 1 step which is the scanning
it happens all the time
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
i can read digital but i dont like it that much
im the same for the most part
for the most part yeah
just read the manga for the art alone
storywise is the only thing 2016-2017 berserk didnt fuck up <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and slideshow was 2016 berserk btw
the original has its own fair share of issues but it still looks better then berserk 2016
i didnt expect any less
~~aslong its not force they're all fine~~
the new style is a big improvement in about any department
you just dont judge animation on stills
people judge on stills
thats the problem
anyway for the new anime the new style is a mix between SM and old
the new artstyle is "simplified" but gags work a lot better with it
and the old artstyle didnt really work with that
its because they went full digital
on the contrary
there are some adult vn's that also did it but not many
it was pretty special back in the day
SD vn came years before the anime was even a thing
in case of SG yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_e1Q3GZ2GqI&list=PL1AzECNGnl5aRDQU2AXJoNfWvaNVKxNCq
but school days (lol) is likely the prime example
the steins;gate remaster of the VN is also fully animated using aniem footage
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
fully animated as in watching anime
most only have the bare minimum, some have quite a bit of different sprites, others are actually fully animated (lol)
depends on the vn
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://puu.sh/EtGBC.png
and nanoha bds include english
it included the official bd pgs
or at least it should be
🤔
its english subbed tho
probably a direct rip
that normal
i read a lot of romance and fluffy stuff
im in the same boat as AK tbh
at least the figs aren't damaged
yeah ron counted
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
but at least nanoha includes them right
they're not good
doesnt ring a bell
i dont read much lately
no wonder it looks cute
>Namo
looks up
yeah i have
SS has better scheduling then YO tbh
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
there was like a year between volume releases in japan
at least they can catch up soon
the monologues is what im scared about for the anime
same for me
yea
might not actually work well for anime if the pacing will be as slow as the ln
it's like extremely slow
its not for everyone though
and anime next year ayy
god bless the novels got licensed
its wholesome yuri
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
well i guess i did read half of the sexworker one
i mainly just watch them <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
im trying but i dont think ive actually read an isekai
waiting for kono to finish before watching it
chihaya is pretty good ay
you should play HR
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
which was a 20h game or so
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
then again i also finished shadows of mordor in a day
think i finished it in a day
eh really short
and you dont really do anything but play the arc
its just short
HR is fun but what is balance
lost song is the best game but its way too short
FB is pretty bad atm
for FB
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
they added the game originals in alicisation
philia is in every sao game
like if you stop playing for a bit and they push a patch you just get behind so bad its not even worth playing anymore
but once again >balance
hollow zone gets really good later on
the best part of the first game was the new dungeon anyway
thats just normal jprg
its not even that bad
but balance doesnt exist <:15min:495770478678638593>
the games are fun for casual play
bcs this is the first original story arc for sao
its half of why im interested in how reki will go about umbral ring
they are
thats just because every game uses the seed as the base
so he knows its in the game and the reason why he knows to summon it in alo to beat the dude
its the part of the arc where kirito finds out excalibur
thats the part that should have been in s1
well
yuuki arc is worth it
<:AinyaGasm:356682640494952458>
god bless yuuki is alive in the game world
oh didnt like her
<:15min:241820657027907584>
but good
seven is basically kayaba
havent played since they outright nerfed dot build
FB added a whole lot of chars yeah
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/swordartonline/images/b/b3/LS_Seven.png/revision/latest?cb=20141226182400 this is her sister seven
she's one of my least favourite
kureha?
better then kirito even until you unlocked like eclipse for him
best dual wield <:15min:495770478678638593>
rain is precious
https://media.karousell.com/media/photos/products/2017/12/11/sao_rain_cosplay_full_set_presales_1512987311_c9054ca1.jpg
he was young yeah
its what progressive solves for the most part
pretty much melua
but seven and rain are one of the best ones
strea not so much but philia is
they're great
leafa's "friend"
that alo lil shitter is still around
kirito isnt even that bad
please
<:15min:495770478678638593>
they just made a separate storymode if you want to play kirito
well FB did the good part about that
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
double rocket launchers or double snipers in FB because why the fuck not
FB was pretty nice in that regard
well no char creation again for the new one iirc
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
until they fuck up again like every sao game so far
i play all of them and i will do the same with the new one
>buff for 30seconds
>oneshot enemy boss
it wasnt even fun gameplay
and instead just buffed enemies to insane levels so it was harder to finish when you played a different build
and then we also have the bugged skill in HR they never fixed
and people started selling modded gear
till the ps4 version got hacked
HR was fun in pvp
just running around and dotting a whole bunch of enemies was fun as fuck
FB was fun until they nerfed dot build
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
seven is her sis
rain*
seven is just so much better then kirito and dual wields
or series actually
best dual wield character in the game
suguha is better design
<:smug:239129154061205505>
she gets a bit later on
well
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
or want changed
thats the least of the things i would be mad about in alo
and it takes place in japan
but it doesnt change the fact that its just a normal happening in japan
well the south is weird
thats just a plain culture difference
thats not even strange
but cousins marrying is normal in japan
yes
eeh
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
its not incest when its not blood related
esp with asuna's damsell in distress
at least reki agrees that FD was bad and not something he would write now
its dumb but it fits sao
and the only thing we had after was the yuuki arc to salvage most of it
alo just destroyed most of asuna's character
how can you even hate asuna
who would have guessed
the best sao arcs are the arcs who dont focus on kirito as a lead
<:15min:495770478678638593>
its by far the best sao he wrote
i disagree
its also gonna be nice to see what happens bcs there's no wn to check back on for it to see what could happen in the future and what the differences between wn/ln would be
UR now can show how much experience he has gotten over the years
everything adapted so far was already existing when he wrote it as a wn
but umbral ring is his real test tbf
which gets better the longer the series goes on
og sao just boils down to reki being bad writer
yeah
<:AinyaGasm:356682640494952458>
use old game save to overwrite a save in a totally different game
thats just technological advancement <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
>lol overwrite save
but yeah it was extra bad in alo
so every game uses part of the cardinal system
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>

Fuck him

yeah fuck him
leafa's friend?
<:15min:241820657027907584>
her boobs are a different size in every scene
she just suffers from the tsubasa disease
i might pick up beastars (lol) and stars align
which is a nice thing tbh
AL just gives a lot of fan service for AL players
san diego in ep 3 is best
m8
if i wasnt playing AL i would have never picked it up
a super fun thing if you play the game
azur lane is just like
so it just became a habit to watch it on sunday mornings
ive been following one piece since the beginning
3 ep rule always
yeah thats what i do
so didnt list
i have stuff like one piece and things also but those are not from this season
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
not even ebata is saving this show
choyoyu, jet girls and rifle is beautiful on the verge of dropping
seasonally i have eh: aikatsu on parade, rifle is beautiful, fate, boardgames the anime, azur lane, heroaca4, choyoyu, sao, nanatsu (still have to start), souma4, jet girls
is that everything you're watching?
and i would have to grind too much for a completely different build so i cba playing
but they nerfed it so hard the build got killed completely
okay dots did need a nerf tbf
i havent played it since dotr nerf
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
theres like 3-4 phone games
~~sao already has tha tcovered~~
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i just want to see how they will fuck it up this time
<a:15min:490152367631630346>
didnt get what you want? just grab a different stash and see if he can rid you of money
he's just an actual dealer
<:15min:495770478678638593>
it resets shop
yeah
sometimes has some broken weapons
it opens late in the game but yeah it sells weapons
not mine btw

and stars align if i pick it up
wednesday i just have boardgames
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
wednesday is even better for me
same thing really
or is it 23th it airs
22th is tuesday tho 🤔
and i gues chihayafuru starts tuesday
and it was pretty good
i dont have any interest in either of them but i saw clips of the suplex
yeah the konosuba's author other ln
<:15min:495770478678638593>
well the actual wrestling isekai or the isekai were he just done it just bcs
or the other one
the isekai one?
then having to run to the frontdesk and ask for the camera
bcs its way faster
same if we need to take pictures
so everytime they ask if i want to switch i pull out the phone tho
i keep my work calendar on my phone
as long as you dont do it straight in their face
but bosses also use them so everyone just does
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
or so says the rules
we're actually not allowed to use smartphones at our job
i have a workphone at work
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
same aya
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
and then ill reply back after work
and reply
i can just send a message and they'll see it after work
calling not so much tbg
phones are convenient to have when its messages
but those arent as easy to use as one would think when everyone works different shifts
and yes phone exists
depends on the year and when we can see each other
either the kids put something together for parents or we buy something alone
when a bday happens we take everyone out to a restaurant for example
we're fairly close as family
give something, get something back
its just part of the course
but im a working adult so i also give them something
parents give money still
<:hillaryous:239169549512081409>
i buy them myself
yes yes i do
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
but is it a week after new years
pls
so am i
xmas-new years-anniv
instead of 3 times
so they jsut pile up everything so they only need to gift gifts once
bcs its at the start of the month
i hate having my bday in january
bcs im in january and she's in august
but in reality its closer to a year
im from 92 and my sis is from 90 so you would think its 2 years apart
years are magic
<:smug:239129154061205505>
that's aois bday
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:Suhaha:340544854235021323>
if they replaced staff again
i wouldnt mind another one
well yeah
jp, en, ch multi release which is also nice
subscription
still deciding
it might be sub based though he said
Kouki said he hates gacha so it won't have any
Mikhail looks interesting
it's been an eternity
ye
-ML TDA ep4 + mobile game still in the works(lol) 
-KGNE reboot vn
-Project Mikhail, tent name, Muv-Luv based action game on pc/mobile (build tsf, customize) 
-Muv-Luv integrate, sequel to alternative
>Muv-Luv alternative anime!!
they did a whole bunch of announcements <@279341087494242304>
yeah saw it live
bds hopefully
s1 and s2 were A1
now they meet Deen on s3 which actually even made it worse
people complained about A1 on s2
i like this
granrodeo im trying to remember what they said
isayama (aot author), granrodeo and jam project had video messages. Isa reconfirmed again how big an inspirement ML was for AoT, jam project said without age they likely wouldn't have went as big as they were now
brb in 30
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
mafia was on the livestream btw solo
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
this is enough reason for me to actually finish my replays
esp if they aren't gonna touch unlimited or extra like solo said
Unless you're a fan of the games i doubt it's actually something people will like tbh
it had 2 failed mobile games to be precise
https://twinfinite.net/2019/10/muv-luv-integrate/?utm_source=dlvr.it&utm_medium=twitter
beta in extraverse <:harold:364119409620418591>
kouki started with I like turn A and Tomino and we have all these parallel worlds....
did you see the concept art for integrate yet btw?
hope they release KGNE reboot in English also
ye
but yeah guess we'll see how it plays out
<:suhaha:585983562478780416>
could have gotten us the second half of TE also
they said proper sequel to alternative and no short story collection
well vn is who knows
yes
the original novels span 10 volumes or so
yes?
second half will be 2 parts also <:15min:495770478678638593>
3 actually
sao? yeah lmao
sao <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
Fate <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
they also reuse neptunia assets in their newer non nep games
i should probably invest in a region free one and just use that tho <:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
and i just hook up tv to pc and watch stuff that way
i just have 2 bd drives (one set to region A and the other to region B) because ibuy so much bds
so i have 2 drives
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the collector in me says i need a disk drive
well its not actas so that helps
titles arent their forte
and tomino makes very stupid comments all the time
he mentions kyoani but the works dont have sex is a comment only to shinkai
the title is misleading though
damn happy
<:OMEGALUL:483610064268296192>
symphos action director is the action director for starlight
sort of
<:15min:495770478678638593>
well we know what the sympho peeps will be working on now
i don't think a sequel was necessary at all
ye recap and sequel movie
a dark grey filter would probably have been enough
maybe they shouldnt have full desaturated ye
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
well  that was to indicate how the power worked
and make sure his battery doesnt run out <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but pretty close
not the same
~~symphogears and alchemy~~
you know what magic and espers remind me of
same author sure but if manga editor  doesnt like X he will tell kamachi to change it
manga and lns have different editors
its always interesting to read different people opinions
you can vent all you want for my part <:15min:495770478678638593>
yes and she has that right
sisters arc aside, i still like the original arcs more
you sure like projecting your touma hate
something that doesnt matter right now
later on
thats the key thing there
<:harold:364119409620418591>
~~handed~~
bcs he is right
esp if its a level 0
scared of getting beaten by someone weaker
every esper has that
i still like HO more then index
<:harold:364119409620418591>
yeah
<:15min:495770478678638593>
index is hser also
actually
i feel that pain
be it official or fan tl
majority just isnt available over here
and just like manga
then you're looking at the wrong LNs
>most of them
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
and it ended
which is anime original
my favourite one is still tamayura
well i guess mahouka is alive
all my favourite ones are ded <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
good or they would have had to call rie <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
at least sunrise is/has releas(ing/(ed) boxset for s1+2
s3 never tfw
well no sane person would ever touch that to tl
but reading that is actually effort
<:panic:282277202995970048>
fuck i should do that
oooh
HO, index etc
<a:15min:490152513623031809>
what a guy does for his idols
i think i finished the anime at least?
the wn doesnt have the ed
the only good thing death march had was the ending song in the anime
>death march
most of my lns get bought when i visit japan tbf
its right up my alley so one day
oh that new one
<:RadioSmug:317473462702833665>
is that the one with the naruto op
it might have helped if lns didnt flop over here in the early 2000s
you know
<:Ver:244664866529345537>
beat that
i have exactly one page of poetry
pff only 6000
index volumes arent overly long
its gonna be pretty close
that probably amounts to 45 index volumes <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yes
every so often
i find that out by accident
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
no not really
adn ive read eh till v6? or 7
pls
alread ysaw the anime
sue me
its better then index
like it was a test
did nt you say soemthing about HO
oh cypher
for late night anime is pretty average i guess
510,601,900 yen  around 4.7mill total in Japan
wait that was last tracked weekend only
~500000 dollars in Japan
they arent
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
even the vn paced that part better
there was no reason to have 3 eps straight talking while in a reality marble
they inserted too much original were they didnt had any reason to do so
it looks pretty but thats about it
evne the ufotable one
ubw anime is trash
lns are just plenty easier to translate
there's plenty of good novels around
<:15min:495770478678638593>
not a light novel
monogatari is actually classified as a novel
🤢
looking at you majikoi
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the best anime are the vn adaptations that go for a complete original story
and you need to understand the endings before you go true end
they will have to make a choice in movie 3 for what ending
HF a good as it is isnt an substitute
well its not
yeah
s3 is pretty bad
og as s1-s2
og aikatsu is still best aikatsu but stars is pretty amazing
probably works out better for them this way
they went back to being a licensor
hibike eupho
yuuki yuuna
to the point they just flat out stopped selling bds
didnt work out well for them
just release in the west with jp price system
ponycanusa tried to do the same
it works for aniplex so they wont change it
get a different one
well thts not gonna happen
i would import some precure bds but 💰 x5
they want a lot of cash for it
its just mainly toei really
the filter they use is one that tries to evocate the old school feel
bcs its anniversary project
well star twinlle was outed as back to basics since it was announced
on one hand saban not having the rights anymore is good
on the other hand now that its under hasbro  its equally worse
nope
well
more in line with the older shows
star twinkle at least is much lighter on content compared to huggto
lala is precious
reminds me i need to catch up with star twinkle
and previous entries touched upon drugs and other things
like huggto touching on suicide, pregnancy and stuff isnt something you expect from a show for 7year olds
and that for a kid show
at least precure has the balls to touch subjects other anime doesnt want too
in no particular order
huggto, futari wa, heartcatch
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i see precure
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
do you not have bills
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
well part of ccs is about growing up
i havent seen something dubbed since ages
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xjhs2cE1IY0
10/10 for the ed tho
clear card-hen was still nice but  it wasnt the same
same
just tried too many times
well i did find the password
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
ill tell you in 30mins bcs im locked out of my account
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
if iremember my password that is
wonder if i can still see how much i paid on rightstuf
i rmemeber it costing a pretty penny at least
quickly reading through amazon reviews <:15min:495770478678638593>
hmm looks like it doesnt have the old dub
i would have to check
it might also have the old one
they redubbed it iirc
new one
yes
the set isnt that good
i have it
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
<:monkaS:391991730486116352>
they're sort of in a dead state
doesnt surprise me
<:smug:239129154061205505>
ichigo is better dw
yume is a close second
<:15min:495770478678638593>
you misspelled ichigo
i need to start parade though, it futures all main characters from the previous aikatsu
friends is also pretty good in its own regard
it could be worse
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
bets is miho/miyo whatever her name was but eh
one of the few that actually follow the omnibus format in anime
dating sim that got anime
<:15min:495770478678638593>
dont at me
haruka best amagami
$178.99  aya
<:smug:239129154061205505>
find a better one <:15min:495770478678638593>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sQw32oee4mc
let me link it
it has one of the best openings ever
its pretty good
same
it starts out pretty slow tbh
if you cna stomach it
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
<:smug:239129154061205505>
did you watch ojamajo doremi imaginbreaker?
guess ill die
gotta wake up in 6hs bcs i said i would come with parents to breakfast outing
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
shit its 1 am
only train end might top it
and sue me, school days harem ends are the best ends
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
as usual shit like that just doesnt really work out in anime
vn
<:monkaS:391991730486116352>
da capo is better
wa mc is makoto but worse and gets away with the cheating
<:15min:495770478678638593>
watch/play white album
if you think makoto is bad
eh idk
its fully animated anyway so
thje only clicking you will do is at the options
you mean watch school days solo
i do prefer kimikiss manga adaptations as opposed ot the anime at least
its nice
yeah
amagami is the spiritual successor to kimikiss
ye
<:kappa:281531248634232842>
and yosuga no sora
kimikiss the original
there's amagami and ss+
there's not many anime with omnibus format
<:thinang:452179382945972274>
gonna take my leave now <a:MikuBear:605209676224921630>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
i think i did aya
final volumes are straight out of bishounen draw style
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
but god did the artstyle change
yeah unlike the anime
i should rewatch it actually
nagi no asukara
couldnt wait for that show
~~they didnt release a standard edition until later~~
worth it tho
which costs like 140 bucks <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
or a LE
its mostly a whole bunch of bds
<:monkaS:391991730486116352>
https://puu.sh/EHVUZ.png
remind me i need to buy more on sale
looking at rightstuf was a mistake tho
~~and i forgot friday was fate caster days so now i need to wait a week~~
~~and i need to stop procrastinating and finish replaying muv luv~~
~~which def isnt gonna happen bcs i know myself~~
at least when i get back i have a few more hours in the day to catch up on anime
i hate waking up early in weekends
i totally would do that if i was in japan
one day, when the bd is out
same
~~its why source purists are bad~~
(its not playing to the strengths of the medium in question)
manga medium =/= anime medium
thats not how you are supposed to do anime adaptations
its a 100% panel for panel adaptation
```read the manga and caught a few episodes of the adaptation on toonami - enough to know there's like zero deviance from the manga```
yeah that's why i hate the anime even though is good.
but I'm pretty sure I said that before
in other words, the perfect emoji
<:15min:241820657027907584>
im saying you should watch either of those 3 and flip flappers
nothing
<:smug:239129154061205505>
and flip flappers
just watch any of those 3
bcs i would agree with ranger here <a:15min:490152416751386624>
what was everything again
hold on in a game atm
visually there's a lot they could have done
thats what the anime is supposed to try and fix
thats the problem with the manga
you're summing up the manga medium
its just me not really liking the setting
vinland isnt even good but most will disagree on that so
thats no excuse
there's enough anime grounded in reality
if you cant improve it, dont bother
its why it exists
every adaptation can be improved in a visual medium
the manga has action but the anime is what made it dynamic
then you should know
have you seen the anime?
the anime made them
houseki manga doesnt have them either
you create the dynamic moments
it has
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
thats exactly what they should have done but didnt
```I always try to go beyond the scope of the original, otherwise it makes no sense to make a moving picture. Otherwise it is enough to read the manga or the light novel. It must be somehow recognizable that it made sense that this has become a moving image.```
there's a quote a director made, let me find it
its good but doesnt try to reach higher
it doesnt really do anything to set it apart
```And the music was spot on, as was the VA```
while that is true, you might as well just read the manga
panel for panel or no anime
its from the mangaka
well yes but its not bcs of the anime staff
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
gonna watch cg movie today i think
I'm not in a hurry either, only watched s1 this year so might do the same for s2 and wait till all the bds are released
i still need to watch the ovas
well unicorn was just super lazy editing
ye
bcs its 1h eps
tho i would want to see how they'll handle some of the cliffhangers now
but ye i doubt also that the west will get the rerun
<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
it gives you cool clothes and new hair style so def raiden
the only good piloting method is the ginga bishonen <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
English
you know what's a stolen language?
<:kappa:281531248634232842>
so just hope adachi gets a good enough buffer
that it did
they tend to be solid if not a bit too much holding back
the staff seems decent at least
tezuka (yes those) is such a weird choice for production tho
and the villains were trash
the rest relies too much we can do this and cant fail but hey we fail last second
lafter hit hard in s2 but thats about it
s2 is the worst part
no
ibo forgot what it was in the second season <:15min:495770478678638593>
that was actually a pretty good scene involving orga
where they went out with a literal bang
except maybe towards the end
they didnt focus enough on kudelia in s2
when we can have a calamity war prequel
who cares about a sequel with his kid
the only thing i want to see from ibo is the calamity war
forget about it in s2
set up a rather important arc for ibo's most important character
and the whole of s2 forgot about kudelia's joanne d'arc arc
and it wouldnt have made any difference
he should have died there
yes that was bullshit
rememember that scene where iok should have died but missile  dude who never missed, missed in the last sec?
and just like iok he should have died earlier
eisn was the mecha
shouldnt have used him again in s2
eins was shit
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
s2 was just bad anyway
more so then other deaths
his death was important yes
biscuit death was meaningful tho
gainax has been a dumpster fire for long and this again confirms it
both are novels
neither is monogatari
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but overlord isnt a ln
so they actually look like books and not A4
yes
just give me my pocket sized versions like how the japanese versions look like
and while them getting more and more licensed in the west is a nice thing, i just hate everything about them on how they look
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
i enjoy reading lns more but lately ive been lazy to read
(tamayura)
Potte is precious
you might like them
pls
<:nani:241228065357824001>
<:smug:239129154061205505>
regardless of the kind, character acting beats out animation sakuga every minute of my life
<:smug:239129154061205505>
the latter maybe 20%
aka the former is 80% of anime
while the life kind is the character acting is where the characters are actually treated as people and thus every action they do is coherent with their self and current situation
performance one is the kind that most anime do but you can change the face to any character and it would be the same
guess that will be found out when the staff gets revealed
but will it be the performance kind or the life kind of character acting <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
just gtive me more character acting and i can keep continuing anime
I could have just went for a *insert kyoani show here*
i would have but its tonally so different i didnt
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
just because im biased as fuck towards character acting
yama no susume
tamayura
liz to aoi tori
shinsekai yori
** precure
totally opposite of mine really
<:15min:495770478678638593>
its still one of the highest ranked vns even in japan
for good reason
how did you like the closing chapter
<:smug:239129154061205505>
in public
the face of some people <:KEKW:632364419640328223>
the worst i did was early on reading a manga and keeping a jp-en dictionary with me
never touching fate
<a:15min:490152416751386624>
so the solution to that is to learn more japanese
whenever its a series that involves a lot of technical stuff its hard to read
but i want to read more books
i know enough to get by in japan and read some books
esp now with live 2020 <:LUL:243896110001684480>
yeah one day im gonna continue studying japanese yea
im the guy who walks outside with tshirts that scream anime
dw i dont really care that much either
<:smug:239129154061205505>
people that can read japanese will know
not to the regular public
so you can jsut read in public wihtout anyone knowing what you are reading
cause the actual cover tend to be a mono color
you can like remove the covers
the good part is really
<:harold:364119409620418591>
i read so many i also enjoy the ln ones now
thats my problem AK
grimgar is a fucking ride
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
but it got axed after 2 volumes
i read an isekai a la sao for a few chapters and it was pretty nice
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
thats just dumb
<:harold:595434251286085653>
but i actually like reading trashy ecchi harem lns
i hate to admit it
i
<:AinyaGasm:356682640494952458>
havent tried it out before when i was in japan
probably
so everything either goes on CR or VRV
or to be precise both are part of A&T
RT is part of CR
but like the article mentions if you want to watch rwby in asia you have to go on cr
bcs cr doesnt air much anime in asia
naruto <:15min:495770478678638593>
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2019/12/31/decade-in-review-the-most-watched-anime-of-the-decade-by-country
where was the post sec
yea
if we go by CR
shounen depending on the region
which is nice
but i've sound is also under them
i knew about the key one
visual arts also has a surprising amount of music labels
easy top 3 fav vns <:15min:495770478678638593>
muv luv is good anyway
https://puu.sh/EVhYG.png
well visual arts has quite a few subs tbf
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
also part of visual arts
part of the 4 seasons franchise they did
vn by saga planets was it
<:15min:495770478678638593>
yes it is
is that
nice
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
the shift from introduction chapter to closing chapter is gonna be too funny for anime only watchers
white album 2
and i still want a closing chapter adaptation
it's still light hearted and ecchi but quite different then the anime
rail wars ln and anime are like 2 different shows <:harold:595434251286085653>
buy rail wars light novel instead <:15min:495770478678638593>
its same but different
erai better then hs btw
ill be watching a lot of things but im actually lazy to set up my folders for taiga
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
one is Japan only and the other is global?
at least ost still good
where every single ep was fully outsourced
unlike accelerator that season
but hey at least they did animate it themselves
the anime glances over it
its actually better in the books
so she tought she had sex and was defiled so she thought she was a prostitute
she falls unconsious when a man touches her
she thought she was aya
but it was still better then sword ortaria
well thats just the current arc that was super doozy tbf
im the witch of gluttony <:15min:495770478678638593>
and last i checked an hour ago its still missing for HS
erai has asteroid up already
hs is pretty slow on launch dates
HS fucks with fonts and such so typesetting sometimes gets fucked up on HS
pretty good or so people say
<:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
yeah
she got a new unit in sifas and they did a face reveal
they ruined rina
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
was listening to it now so might as well
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWlfyXi0KYs
sells that well eh
<:harold:364119409620418591>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i still have an unopened package from japan with lns i bought while i was visiting animate
Eiyuu Ganbou is such a good track
<:15min:241820657027907584>
the final eps of s1 hit me hard tho with the exploding ship
felt is best 00 girl <:15min:495770478678638593>
yep
pls
<:okay:330354891727962122>
watch gakuen utopia manabi straight to see where ufotable all begon <:15min:495770478678638593>
kanamemo is alright
ye
saying this year sounds weird when we're 3 jan
second half is like this year?
first half yeah
havent seen it (yet)
im waiting to binge it when s2 is done airing
still good action flick to watch when you're bored at least
pretty much
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
and then you have the movie
the worst ive seen is still zetman tbf, close to 200 chapters in like 12 eps
no idea tbf and nah it wasn't
that's not what i expected to happen in 2020
>new higurashi anime
unlike the official english
but you can actually change it to good english
i mean sure
the official english title is stupid
ye
but shield girl isnt isekai <:15min:495770478678638593>
yeah sentai updated subs for the bds
and its owned by aniplex ironically
it exists but its not available in most countries
which they dont use
which is weird when there's official tls out for the poems that are more accurate then what sentai uses
the poems are bad though
thats pure sentai then
well yea
and commie edits sentai
well there's only commie for chihaya
just edited which is what makes the difference
90%of the fansubs are official subs though
official subs skip the editing part
bcs fansubs edit
~~but when you get paid 80bucks per ep i wouldnt expect any standards~~
their jp office is only for licensing and stuff
well where else aya
main office is US
which is what you see right now
they changed it when funi licensed it and used the title kadokawa gave them
yep
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://puu.sh/EXIxU.png
bcs it comes from the author anand
<:15min:495770478678638593>
funimation actually changed it for the better
thats the official english title
is the original
```All points are divided to VIT because a painful one isn’t liked.```
eh thats actually the better english tl
didn't had time to search yet
now you're asking something aya
<:smug:239129154061205505>
sentai has like 1 very bad translator and hope its not her
just chekc who tld the show
which is alreayd rare
at least sentai credits
actually enjoyed budoukan a lot
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
producer=/=director <:harold:364119409620418591>
roselia but im done with the game <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:15min:495770478678638593>
the anime isn't tho
esp not when they're 24+ eps
i just don't have the time anymore to watch older finished shows
same and i never will
ye
same
they cant aways save a project though
but there's too many directors and animation people i like
i already filter heavily before starting anyway
Unless it's actually so terrible
<:15min:495770478678638593>
i always use the ep 3 rule
shield girl and dendro are filling the same vrmmo niche butbone atleast is cute and the other is just uninspired so probably gonna drop it after ep 3
i have a few more shows that still need to air aya so dw
that's about it whatbi watched so far, still need to start bangdream3 and somali
asteroid: your run of the mill kirakira show
magireco: less suffering more inu curry
heyacamp: give s2 already
eizouken: easy breezy
shield girl: shield girl in a bethesda mmo
dendrogram: zzzzz
hatena: average like all averag shows but I'll be watching this out of respect for the dead author
budoukan: me
hmm let's see
it's essentially me the show and it has some pretty good art backgrounds
<:15min:495770478678638593>
like the dad isn't bad but after introducing the male lead he just fucks off on a business trip in the ep
don't watch hatena then <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
feels like such a staple nowadays
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
i know about gon ans that's about it
Doremi
s4 also suffers from not having Umakoshi who happens to be very busy with a certain other magical girl movie <:Desstare:582385989268537374>
thats bcs they replaced most of the staff actually
m'lady
that should be nice
yeah
i mean gjm didnt release ep 1 yet
🤔
https://puu.sh/EZ7dL.png
im using gjm for it
later
corner was pretty good
all 3 of them
liz and that were my fav movies i saw last year
i enjoyed it
its why 50min eps (like the gup das finale ones and such) are counted as movies
ye
yea
i didnt want to go back too far
just like
liz is the best movie but you want to have seen eupho for that <:LUL:243896110001684480>
Maquia
but maybe he wants less mainstream
yeah ofc
the sailor moon crystal remake of the dream arc will be 2 movies
and sailor moon is getting movies anyway aya
that and sailor moon was mostly my childhood
http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/doremi/index.html
this guy
she did what she was supposed to do
yeah
not that i counted
its like 50-60 chapters or something?
yeah
^
most of the final stuff is just number.1 number .2 anmd shit
just need to announe a s3 first
just about enough
yeah
enough for a third season
thats the one thing no index/railgun  anime helped with for some years
tho lolipop girl was cute
yeah lol
railgun og arc was still better then index movie <:15min:495770478678638593>
S was a lot worse
yeah s1 original was fine
i watch it mainly for the action
ye
it's a fun movie but that's about it
but what happened, happened
she shouldn't even have been in the cage
<:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
too fat
i tried
they made an exact replica of the birdcage
can't fit through them
nah
after 20 eps<:15min:495770478678638593>
and ruined her
which didn't fit asuna
bcs >alo mostly tbf
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
god bless for that
alreayd done that multiple times anyway <:LUL:243896110001684480>
sucks the fate exhibition is over when i plan to go to japan in september
<a:15min:490152367631630346>
proto mashu
<:towel:290204934736052224>
with shielder as mc
ye
<:15min:495770478678638593>
aka a fourth original route
it could have been the original plan
AoD and stuff
german providers do the same
its how you spot who subbed it easily <a:15min:490152416751386624>
funi is just the ts on top
tries a minimal amount of typesetting
cr at least like
whenever typesetting has "" its funi
well it uses "enter words here"so the subs come from funi actually
A Certain Scientific Railgun > A certain magical railgun
the title translation just takes the cake today
well sissy aside
yea funi fucked up
world of warcraft
but eh pretty region blocked for everyone
wakanim and AoD are one of the best streaming services
https://www.nanoha.com/img/popup/image4.png
yes today
you guys need more hope
inb4 its actually a stage play or a live action <:LUL:243896110001684480>
announced at the nanoha 15th anniv live
<:15min:495770478678638593>
https://twitter.com/lyricalnanoha_/status/1218832919994585088
new nanoha anime project <:towel:290204934736052224>
but i suppose we should move this to gaming
```uhh that was in... legion and thingy. I mean they werent bad bad
they were just bad comapritvely
WoD```
they would have been kicked in my guild if they didnt perform like they should at mythic level
like if you're cutting edge raiding and your tanks are bad you should have replaced them
when was that
<:15min:495770478678638593>
nobody fucks up the sheeps in overlord
they fucked up the sheep
twas bad
also lizard sex
would leave them more time for the last arc without having to rush it
it's just that it was content for 2 and a half eps
oh def
it was like 5 eps?
it reads a lot better
they stretched the lizardman arc tbf
author added her in the novels for the reason so that ainz could freely move around outside of nazarick
ye she doesn't exist in the wn
<:harold:364119409620418591>
or am i mixing the wn and the novel
i haven't actually read past volume5 for overlord so maybe the author wrote her in now
she's anime original
well she doesn't exist in the novels so
i love so-bins art
big black with fantastic covers
i have the jp ones
it's ok
<:towel:290204934736052224>
i really like them
but ye def read the novels when you can
which was completed at s3
the director did say in interviews he was only gonna do the series up until the web novel ending
then again if we ever get s4 it's gonna be a different staff
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
sebas was like the best thing
and they removed everything about the sisters
it follows the wn and albedo is anime original
only in broad lines and general plot
the anime doesn't even follow the novel
ever since s1 ep1
overlord always had bad cgi
I'm usually fine with bad cgi tho
was actually mad when they appeared
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
gonna use the code that comes with fate bd1 as backup plan in case i fail lottery for gear
~~also bought fate babylonia bds and azur lane bds on preorder~~
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
so the collection is complete
not that big a fan of s2, but it does remind me i still need to buy the bds for s2
lh eh
dw only 15mins
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
brb as well, was supposed to be showering 20mins ago
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
stuck at deen
<:15min:495770478678638593>
or nodoka's penguin
lile mashu or jeanne
i wouldn't mind reincarnating for specific stuff
but why cypher
granted twas nothing big and only set-up for later stuff
they have a part in that arc but they cut it out
younger and older to be precise
nigredo and rubedo are albedos sisters
last arc
shalltear
the bloody valkery arc?
remember s1
albedo's youngest sister
the strongest entity of nazarick
not even ainz in full equipment can defeat rubedo <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
you would love rubedo
that's not rubedo
>ainz
toned down so hard in the anime
shalltear <:ADAM:338363978797547539>
<:RadioThisIsFine:585896705040580624>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
like rubedo
we never even saw the best ones
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XzWcameJDow
quick
its a bit too long in s2
they lose part of their memories every time they die
it is a concern
they're likely to have been working on both shows together for a while now
what if sins looks like ass bcs lh is a priority
<:towel:290204934736052224>
yes
and yes
yes
<:towel:290204934736052224>
hahaha
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
HR is a complete different game
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
just had fucked up balance
but anyway HR is better
bcs its ggo arc story
only on the kirito gamemode that forces you to play as him
kirito doesn't appear at all in the normal cutscenes
it's a separate game mode
it doesn't
HR is much better
sort of
LS was the most boring game
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but not 7sins bad
so unless they're really dropping the ball it should look average
nhk-e is the channel ye
and they require shows to be fully animated before Broadcast
on the positive side it airs on nhk
so 13 eps seems pretty likely
which I'll doubt they'll follow
ye
jist v11 and v12
so not much gonna happen i reckon
ye
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
we're long past that
excaliber is plot relevant in s1
no aya it's not
myfigurecollection is a site dedicated to figs
and actually watch s2 first bcs you said you only watched s1
ep 1 to 5 is available online so start from ep 1
<:15min:495770478678638593>
and its now on a month break till tv broadcast catches up
tv broadcast did indeed start today
it aired online earlier
we're now just seeing it
its been going on since before 2014
and what they need to do is take on less projects for the near future (which is hard bcs schedules being filled already etc)
what im trying to say is that they're in a rough period right now
JC staff is still one of the bigger (and oldest) studios that exist and can easily support up to 4-5 shows a season without a problem under their normal circumstances
the problem is with schedules being so packed to like 2022 and something happened at JC staff (that only they will know)that caused a mini meltdown
its a normal thing in anime
i'ts bad but not rare
if thats what they needed to keep it afloat then so be it
<:smug:239129154061205505>
and now have 200+ animation staff inhouse
but since then they got their own actual building instead of hiring one
A1 just more back in the days
every studio works with mostly freelance
nah
thats 2012 old A1
everything else had every ep outsourced to a different company
the only show they did themselves that season was danmachi 2
would have been better if jc staff actually animated a single ep <:LUL:243896110001684480>
but like
better then index 3 accel sure
it was alright
>accel
>overbduget
did we watch the same show cypher
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
im interested in the behind stuff
das why franxx (while the show was meh) was nice to follow bcs even if it was a collab between 2 studio's everyone already knew eachother from in the gainax days
~~the fifth gang is still at gainax but thats a ded studio~~
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
and there they have been called the Idolm@ster gang
and the fourth gang in gainax went to aforementioned A1
and then someone split from gonzo themselves and made studio gokumi
then you have a gang making gonzo
then you have anno and the gang making khara
there's a group that formed trigger
<:15min:495770478678638593>
gonzo is split from gainaz
well yeah
<:smug:239129154061205505>
>gainax
>gainax
>gainax
>gonzo
>insert other studio's here
that happens like with every studio <:LUL:243896110001684480>
but yeah i can see a producer or director (thats actually not freelance) leave JC staff to make their own sutdio or join another studio
and mahouka
the actual producer for index is still at jc staff
he's just the ln editor so not that important
someone splitting off JC staff
you know what i could actually see happening? and wouldnt really be unheard of
~~granted like 200+ also focus on specific tasks and dont want to be a spotlight studio~~
plenty to chose from
there's already 200+ studio's
they will
just need to give it time
<:harold:595434251286085653>
<:flap:264123355622408202>
<:flip:244638218408951808>

but you're missing kud wafter <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
mine mostly is the same as what you posted
<:15min:495770478678638593>
tomoyo after is better then clannad tbf, that one actually hurts
summer pockets
and they have that upcoming now delayed phone visual novel
im waiting to play SP till official release
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
pls
i just listen to last smile, birthday and owari mostly
ye
he's so much better at song writing then actual full route scripts
and being good at it
wait till you get to last smile
2012 i think?
yeah its old
<:okay:330354891727962122>
reminds me, did you lsiten to the album yet AK
~~that album kills a little bit of me every time i listen to it~~

https://heaven-burns-red.com/
it is a phone game tho <:LUL:243896110001684480>
delayed from February till somewhere in 2021
Heaven burn red
seeing as maeda gonna work on it himself again
but ye i wonder what trainwreck the new game will be
Air still has the best insert song
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
rewrite was completely a wreck on the other hand
ye refrain was good
leastns1
good show meh adaptation
little busters
next weeks ep is apparently gonna be memory snow
the others are premium channels and the show still is available on online networks
ye
np AK
<:15min:495770478678638593>
<:harold:364119409620418591>
I
switched to anilist after
that's what i did till they died for a while
did give us 20mins extra runtime in return though
the movie also got delayed <:15min:495770478678638593>
and somewhere till the middle i suppose
only the OP is good
no not really but this depends if you like super corrected works or not
just sucks
lol
they already delayed ep 7
<:15min:241820657027907584>
at least for me and ak it is <:LUL:243896110001684480>
but ye its really good
adachi to shimamura*
~~unlike english printed counterparts~~
easy to take anywhere and everywhere to read
pocket size
lmao yeah
<:hyp:250363576005558272>
movies tend to have a bit more leeway at least and even then its not that stellar as you can see
well its not unheard of for shows to finish an ep hours before broadcast
sadly enough
most movies still finish a few days before deadline
its not
now he can go back to gup <:15min:495770478678638593>
bcs macross adapts to the current times
same tbf cypher
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
eh what was the name
less dense then ichiya
second half of virgin soul ruined everything what made bahamut good
fuck that
s2 <:GENOCIDE:657729913050103871>
oh bahamut
😂
i do actually hate the final ep
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
the story was finished after ep 12
mayo chiki ep13 was filler
but aya you didn't miss much
like pre 2010
i could think of something else if i actually remembered half of the shows i finished
honestly it's probably dal
pretty sure i finished my most hated anime
hard question
🤔
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
probably bcs I'm a masochist
i hate it with a passion
idk why I'm still watching dal
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
not that i ever watched s1
well i was never excited for quints
the problem with those shows is the no monologue
😂
nina was a good mc
s2 first half was pretty good tho
s1 is still one of the best shows ive seen that year
show never recovered
but ye on virgin soul ||making kaisar a zombie|| was like the worst thing ever and just signaled the ruin of the second half
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
everything can be shit and I'll still watch it as long as they don't fuck up the ost
danmachi has a good ost and yukachi
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
only the scenario writer is the same as toji anime iirc
with new staff and a different studio
bit late but yes its an ova adaptation of the mobage
so did bleach so i dont see the problem <:15min:495770478678638593>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
now people can finally stop asking when bleach,s final arc will be adapted
cypher pls
hopefully that never happens

mid 2000s eh
<:15min:241820657027907584>
tsukihime is actually alright if you just never heard of the vn and go in anime only
oh it is worse
just watch it <:15min:495770478678638593>
MoD is famous for being one of the worst rated anime ever made cypher
yes
no i saw the twitter announcement before the ep even came out subbed
i havent watched the ep yet
its just split cour really
we knew it was 24 eps total bcs the producer leaked it before the project even started
well serious isnt wrong
<:lul:542837203840008193>
everything gets used
its fine
<:15min:495770478678638593>
but thats just a school
re: digimon
it runs in the same timeslot that db super and gegege no kitaro aired in so unless super returns in July it's likely gonna be a longer running series.
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
~~Toei being smart~~
yes
can't air something that isnt finished
they just take the loss
see all the anime delayed
except it is
and air the rest on a later date
honestly at this point they should just end T
like AB and charlotte
from visual arts(KEY) and PAWorks
just a new project
nah not AB
anime project that is
they're announcing a new project on 10 may tho
same
granted its only the first part out of multiple vns for AB
ye
so it would still have to be delayed
voice actors arent working
and even if they have eps ready
<:15min:655058014495047690>
bcs this is gonna keep happening every week
when covid is over
and air the dreamer arc at  later date
but yeah i believe it would just be better to end current arc and end it there
starting an arc and leaving it on a cliffhanger midway *cough shokugeki s3* is really shitty practice
unlike previous seasons
they had enough material available to not do that
and they're out of that
yes they bought airtime for 25-26 eps
not 15
next ep is 14
yes so thats ep 14?
so 11 for dreamer
confirmed 25 eps
11 eps actually
or 10
its 12 eps
>shorter
for T to finish properly the anime scheduled to air in the timeslot T is airing in would have to be delayed
its lost air time
but anyway it doesnt rteally matter
they did both
or aired a prev ep
it aired recaps in the weeks it didnt air
the air time is already done and over with
and reair prev eps
they already aired 3-4 recap episodes
they only have air time for 26 eps
and the air an ep air a recap air an ep already means they're out of air time
rofl
<a:15min:490152244503904266>
~~sounds like a certain rpg writer~~
unless aniplex actually gives them 24 eps thsi time around lmao
if maeda is writing it again i will just expect it to be more of the same
~~should probably link it so here~~
https://twitter.com/Charlotte_AB_/status/1256530130161156096
oh nice
havent finished it
was pretty good for the part i played at least
the game adds a lot of backstory to the chars and stories they couldnt put into the anime
ye
they havent even said anything about part 2
its been ages
i forgot
or 6
around the same
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
out of 3?
its only 1 part
pretty sure its longer
the vn is basically how the anime would have been if it wasnt for it being 13 eps
i have the limited edition
the game is huge
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
there isnt much to do sequel wise tho
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
it just gets more spotlight nowadays
i wouldnt say its a big resurgence
~~they're not tendou maya tho~~
the link says the anime title btw
<:WorstTimeline:451521970266177536>
which they had to cancel bcs of covid
they still need to do auditions
pdp might happen this year but the second series is still a maybe
<:KirikaShout:607741871703457812>
yikes
>died at age 43
>liver cancer
its why i think hatena and marchen having anime is just pure homage
lots of artists and production staff knew him
he was part of comiket's staff
Matsu was pretty well known
Märchen Mädchen he only wrote a draft for, was a co-publishing and i think the other author is still continuing the series out of respect.
 Hatena Illusion > 4 volumes released > forever unfinished
after that we got
mayoi nekko overrun, 12 novels > finished > got anime 
Listen to Me, Girls. I Am Your Father!  18 light novels > finished > got anime

those 2 got anime before he died in 2016
which by now i think all his shows getting anime is just a homage to the guy
same thing with matsu
he's been sick for ages
the last few volumes were written in the hospital iirc
poor guy tho
they used the same manuscripts to let someone else from bunko write the last light novel
ye
they based the ending of the anime on manuscripts he wrote from his deadbed
>and in that case the anime actually overtook the light novels i think and had its own ending

sort of because the author died
and the producer loved it so he just kept pushing for more
back i nthe day
bcs zero was actually fairly popular
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
they just never told the fandom until the first season was over.
its generally already greenlit to have been 2 seasons in the first place
if a show gets a second season right when the final ep ends
and they had the voice acting finished kind of party late jan or February
the show was finished before corona hit
can't be
<a:15min:490152237151158274>
the real question is if they'll get rie for the hayate's author other manga thats getting anime
nah guys
yea sorano
Tomohiro Matsu (松智洋)

they literally drew artwork on his coffin
they just cant bcs tokyo is still in lockdown
they're eventually gonna go back to work covid or not
<:Feels:702281062985891900>
precure very good, please end the haitus
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
https://mobile.twitter.com/CureLunar/status/1262517091753553920
talking about precure
it was just a see what happens
it was canceled before they even green lit the anime
eh it still got an anime
cypher
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ar08C9EBPMI
everything they do exists to shit on something
pop team epic is is just a super shit show
teekyu is like taking drugs
10/10
teekyu is also acid inducing
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
pop team epic exists
>there's no such thing as the best

nah
cr wouldnt even gain anything from doing that
pinging in nsfw
give me like a second but this site for images just keeps loading
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
guys pls
for darkness
the real tlr meme is finding the vagina shots in the eyes in the manga
yami is my favourite char so darkness is gonna be good
actually need time to watch it
darkness is just very lewd
for every show
people always tell that
i still need to watch darkness tbf
but on the topic of keijo, they do actually have enough material for a second season <:LUL:545650745534447631>
52 volumes
yes
mangawise
back in 2017
hayate ended though
if only it didnt miss 12 episodes
the manga adapts the anime
yes its original
i dont do charts like this bcs its just impossible to put down 10 favourites
its dumb but fun
watch it cypher
https://anilist.co/anime/6280/Cat-Shit-One/
cypher did you watch cat shit one
T7 is a nice guilty pleasure anime
well if you like mars of destruction you really have shit taste <a:15min:490152230561906688>
shirabi is doing the designs for the ln iirc
ill just watch that
isnt 86 gettign anime
eh
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
imagine watching for tatsuya and not for the cutiepie girls
ye they are
<a:15min:490152463555624991>
she's just not developed in some departments
she's as old as everyone else
<a:15min:490152463555624991>
shizuku is besto
miyuki isn't even besto
there's miku, yu and mirei and to a lesser extend sherry (FT) and Aoi (yama no susume)
she's mostly cast for not "gay as fuck" shows but she has a few
neko became pretty <:obama:439779824299540491> in the new version
its pretty forceful iirc
same
heh
<a:15min:585535793066672142>
just like in gear
nothing happens
<:thinkoshii:556977202369921064>
those take it to the extreme
with miyafuji
she's pretty gay
ah lynette
do you remember who?
heh
and some other of the strike witches also
iirc she gets referenced in brave witches
i love miyafuji, i hope you do 2
there's an idol themed anime based on the witches this/next year
you have the chibi style anime and thats bout it
you have several ova's
brave witches is the spinoff
then you can join us in watching the new season
you have like a year to watch SW + the movie
i enjoyed strike witches a lot more
>2016
>old
did you watch strike witches?
mouths is something they tend to never get right
thats just cgi things though
its not really like bad
ive seen BW
its clearly noticeable but its like not bad
that cgi isnt even that bad
<:15min:406862587657977866>
also gonna watch that?
he did porn in 2002 btw under an alias
so even if he doesnt do anything you're still gonna feel and see the influence
granted in any case shinbo's influence on shaft is big
mal is pretty bad with credits
he wrote eps on that
with chief director being shafts fancy name to put a famous name on it to attract people
for every shaft anime after he was just "chief director" or wrote some eps
madoka was his last director role
he hasn't directed a show since 2011
are you watching shows shinbo directed or shows he has his name attached on
most do, there's exceptions
not always
magic is just a natural things for females iirc
its magic, dun need no explaining
strike witches is about the 501
takami is part of the 508
>does Takami appear in Strike Witches?
No
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
they did fix it which is what matters
thats classical shaft just upped by 100%
cant beat aniplex and wit on that department tho
yea
low wage, non compensated overwork
like every other studio pretty much
and the anime industry is already that to begin with
you wouldnt want to work under a toxic environment
which is probably the better for the staff tbh
<:FeelsStrongMan:702281062985891900>
and did fire force
they joined davidpro
mostly people that worked on monogatari
that caused a lot of people to leave last year
shaft apparently has a very toxic upper management
mappa isnt paying people but they keep burning out shows
it could always be worse
the problems they got in 2012-2014 are now showing their heads
JC is in a slump
its not like when was it 2011? bad when that one animator died on his workdesk at A1 but its a bit better
A1 is still fairly hectic to work at though
wit also wants to do it
ufotable and pa works also try to be like kyoani
trying too
and they're paying people
they basically went from outsource everything (like most other studio's) to try and do as much as inhouse as possible.
which is the complete opposite of years ago
a1 is one of the better studio's to work at nowadays
but they're still not mappa so i guess its fine
but that also goes to a lot of other studio's
they have some good shows (and some pretty darn great shows) but they'r e also one of the trendsetters with whats everything wrong in anime industry.
sort of hanabi
i watched a video of him, it was all nonsense and thats where it ended
and it was bad
and thats all
i've seen exactly one gigguk video
bit back to shaft, i don't really like them <a:15min:490152463555624991>
they're all about clickbaits
i don't follow anitubers in the first place
if ajay is who i think it is ye
if some other anituber says something about the industry  then its probably gonna be wrong anyway
the only one worth following when it's about anime industry
ye
brb
> he worked on Nanoha ?!
he directed the damn show
your best source is actually jp wikis
ye
~~yes~~
database
hey raiden
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
something spicier to reflect the authors tax evasion sound better
nah
but i do hope its MWAM
i hope its not database
atleast railgun is having a big break atm
i just can't say with a guarantee everything is gonna air as announced
you never know cyph
<:15min:406862587657977866>
for now
and both s1 op and s2 op are database
probably bcs log horizon is only 1 entry despite having 2 seasons (3soon)
yr
yeah they're like opposites
yep
legally? no can do
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
not that scene
yeah it works but the actual completed bgs work better for most of the scenes
but then there's nisekoi
i agree with you though, they rock the style and make it work
in case of nisekoi
https://i.imgur.com/nOnQfd7.jpg
what i meant is shit like this lanks
not really no
the reverse of how they actually do things
they went from actual completed backgrounds to use a color template
the bds are just bad
except for nisekoi
its also why their bds have usually such drastic backgrounds/scenery changes
its just funny that their staple animation people love is just caused by them not being able to finish stuff on time
ironically it works pretty well for them
you mean the we dont know how to finish shit in time so we have to use shortcuts and blackouts the animation style?
<:15min:655058014495047690>
which is cool shit regardless
yep
Tatsuya Oishi is who you want for bake and kizu movies
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
it applies to monogatari also
remember our talk hanabi about shinbo
its mostly nisi
yes mappa is doing the new season
as long as it isn't a melting disaster animation wise I'm fine with it and even then I'll be sad about the animators bcs something should have gone wrong for them to have it turn out this way
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
thats said my weathering with you bds arrived so time to watch a movie
<:ree:626087490834661386>
i also dont have time to even watch shows of my on hold list
i dont have time to watch a lot of older shows
havent seen that show but it still looks better then current running tamayomi
~~amazed you still have time to read~~
i go AAAA every new chapter
<:15min:666327834079264786>
>I've already found my ultimate yuri story, I just don't have anyone else to talk to about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
cant beleive you forgot me
heh
heh
~~das finale films are technically classified as films bcs of the way japan does stuff~~
tenk no ko good movie, not as good as kimi no na wa though it has the better ending.
but then you usually just upscale it to 1080p
anime does get mastered at 810p sometimes
doesnt really surprise me
making sounds is very important
they focus more on the side cast and umaru's relationship with them which works a lot better
s2 of umaru is a lot better tbf
and the third group made gonzo
on idolmaster
and the other group started working for A1
most people in trigger did work on gurren
they did tho
because they branched from gainax
<:thinkoshii:559465254338297857>
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
yukachi better
it's not lanks
maybe i should watch the movie
it tries to be monogatari and fails at it
idk bunny was pretty bad
the movies are quite different
even in the second half
trigger still did the action direction for ditr
and then a group split from gonzo
they announced it like monday or tuesday
https://teibotv.com/news.html
7 july or something
july
i binged the s1 bds in a weekend so might do the same again for s2
still not sure if I'll watch rezero weekly or not
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
i get sao in summer so im gucchi
and the 90% of summer will be delayed to fall and later
it's gonna be 90% spring shows and 10% summer shows
summer is gonna be fun
<:MikuPraiseHearts:696848468399882321>
the manga is better but the anime so far did a good job with all the crazy faces
Haven't finished s1 yet anyway
the only thing i saw from s2 is the opening
kake just has the better crazy girls
they're already pushed back to summer
those were spring shows
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
Unless they delay them again
oregarui is also summer
rezero is summer
and rezero, sao being spring shows originally fits so much
it's just gonna be all these spring shows
summer is gonna be shit for me
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
who woulda thought
good stuff happens when you manage to finish a project before shit hits the fan huh
the general rule is that if it doesn't have a date announced it's probably gonna be delayed
<a:15min:585535676133670913>
flix japan that is
you can watch the first 5 eps on flix
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
oh its the advertisment argument
<:15min:655058014495047690>
different staff does wonders
and the anime reflects that
haruhi is written intentionally out of order
tbf the events in index arent really written out of order
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
DM is also airly good
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
index-san is better
whenever you need something you never find it
lemme find this chart
every episode is special case tho
it's nothing really new in the industry
it's credited as jc staff but another studio did it
ye
they outsourced every ep
> iirc Accel is JC Staff as well
yes but actually no
ye based animator
<:obama:461648244049707012>
the epilogue eps still feel weird
but ye that shit was good
<a:aRubytear:393589727904923658>
stop
ep 48 teared me up <:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
granted on healin' good i prefer yellow more
i do but i also like lala very much
pink always the best <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
suffering we do
they only ship out orders atm
the studio is closed atm
until covid
but yeah they have been back to work
not actual animators
the other studio is producer stuff
36 deaths out of 72 employees
well around half i guess
they lost more then half of their staff
some is an understatement tbf
yeah
tokyo has like 200+ animation production studio's lol
and also unfamiliar studio's
yeah if you start looking around on credits on tv episodes  you're gonna start seeing quite a bunch of studio's you might be familiar with.
star twinkle is pretty good
from winter 17 but it gets the point across
https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/winter3.png
20 sentais?
i think ive seen like eh
heh
i should watch sentai again
which i guess is sentai?
heh
sad that nodoka doesn't punch enough
i like yellow more at least so far
yeh
btw kabashima who worked on geah since gx did work on precure for one
yeh
or have stakes in said company
they just own a lot of merchandising rights for kids shows
bandai is probably on top in general
nah that's tsuburaya
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
~~and you get longer henshins as they have to showcase the toys~~
now they pump out merch like crazy
precure wasn't so big on merch until bandai got involved
yeh just a different aesthetic at most if they even want to change it up a little
ye
it's toei though they'll be fine, they have a lot of good directors
he's gonna help them for the near future so probably just the next all stars movie.
he made his own studio
he mostly did the directing on their movies
the movies might get a different aesthetic now
toeis biggest 3d director for precure left the studio this week
it sort of dragged a lil in it's final half but they sure did touch on not so kids friendly themes
hugtto epilogue was wild af
she just usually gets corrected so everything looks like how it should be
she always draws in 80s style <:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
i love how she didn't get corrected in that ep
thanks colour
just gimme all the dino related ones <a:15min:585535676133670913>

prunus girl
kakegurui is shounen

depends on what you think of as a shounen
current shounens wouldn't have been the same without db
tbf
popular shounen disagree hanabi <a:15min:585535676133670913>
it's just the that kind of show
eh if db would be a new series now it would still get popular
i am charging my spirit bomb

i am charging my spirit bomb

true
kaji wasn't all that amazing either
not in rl tho
on gta to shoot it up ye
hanabi or choco
who's wrong
<a:15min:585535676133670913>
it's more of a demographic then it is a genre
it just depends on what you think shounen is
prunus girl was in the same mag as kakegurui lol
ye
they're published in shounen magazines
yeh
stupid cgi ki
the whole of ui is silly
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
and it has a hot nana mizuki
and full of character acting action
no UI
it's what made the broly movie better then super
wish is still stronger then beerus
Beerus isn't even that strong in the first placr
he can't go to UI at will
He didn't exactly master it

ln
ah nah
can't blame you for that fire
they all have manga anyway
you know more sales is more sales <:15min:655058014495047690>
shinkai releases his movies as a novel
yeah
and digital is a trend that they havent really been tracking that much yet
index has more volumes tho so im not surprised fatigue hits in for some people
in terms of sales
sao just has been more consistent
it didnt even rank last year
a few volumes have been #1 iirc
index has been dropping hard in sales since NT v20 and later
sao has been a better seller then index lol
i should rewatch it
yeah same
i know shit about guns xd
ye
i use llen as teammate on ggo game xd

there might be name shenigans like with dragon ball though depending on how they're gonna touch on them
just check super and you know how decent they'll be
its decent
toei does their own inhouse subs
crunchy only hosts it
its like with gear
bandai has the merch right nowadays
thats not even something cr or toei decides
i lolled at that one guy on twitter asking if merch will also be brought over
at least toei isnt dealing with hasbro with it anymore now
and at that time it were 10+ series
>why????
buy all current ones or get nothing
source btw https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-feature/2020/06/23/crunchyroll-announces-summer-2020-anime-lineup
which obviously was way too much risk and money for essentially no gain
back in early 2012 you either had to buy the full package or get nothing
its because TOEI actively blocked precure in the west before
CR will be streaming Healin' Good precure starting in summer season
<:15min:655058014495047690>
precure is now officially licensed in the west

original doesnt mean its bad per se
xD
of shana
its the only song i remember
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
i see cypher is preaching index again
to the high seas we go in fall
reeeeee
fuck
>adachi anime is funimation license
it's reona this time
she doesn't
<:MikuHype:688429715676987428>
nihei is writing it but will be different from the manga
its og story
knights movie in 2021
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-zk1qnp-Tdg&feature=emb_title
yes
they call it that bcs they actually created the show
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
without the drop
the eds are better
only op 1 and 2 are good anyway
<a:15min:490152230561906688>
its bad
its the op that doesnt have that banger drop like the others
i do
<:15min:655058014495047690>
>s3p2 op is bad though
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
if people enjoy it
but double 25 eps is risky as fuck
and with 2 and 3 they just really mean split cour in an awkward way
i can see it if its just 2x 13 eps
i think ive been saying i was gonna watch this for like 3 months now lol
<:dangolove:461649392651206657>
<:lul:542837203840008193>
~~dw they're both cr "originals"~~
when was s2 again?
really gotta make work of it to watch one day
oh slime
which anime btw? <:15min:655058014495047690>
life is harsh
they're just more vocal about it but theyve been doing it since back early 2015
its not liek cr being on the committee is a bad thing
if they actually had shows im interested in that do stream in belgium i wouldnt have any qualms actually paying for like a month to watch it
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
>CR panel
>You guys like tower of god right?
>5min silence, guys in chat tog 2, tog 2
>CR: here's a new original
ye
the best part about the cr stream was the tog bait
should be okay doubt the license is set up that way anyway
and the committee <:15min:655058014495047690>
~~the best part is that no matter what you do you'll support cr without even watching on cr the moment you buy something for it~~
its still a stupid term to use but it fits better
unlike netflix
if its an original they're part of the comittee
i could check my bank i guess, i did buy the live goods on kr shop
i like cdjapan but dont like the pay thing
yah
never really bothered checking
i wonder if king records shop does the former or the latter
if i preorder it now they would already take my money, unlike on amazon
dun want to buy it on cdjpapan tbh
cant even do that <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:15min:666327834079264786>
no eta, probably late summer™

maybe bcs of covid idk
but before today it just showed no purchase option
well they changed it to currently available anyway right now
amazon doesnt let me order it
boule can you buy gx boxset?
amazon isnt evaoh right

japanese prices are well
<:15min:655058014495047690>
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
they do sound like my co-workers at times
<:LulucoSad:239759303429455875>
i dont like any of the side cast
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
he was just taking hte piss on kirito
notkirito is also matsuoka
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
thats all i ever needed
||it had notkirito referencing kirito||
despair despair

oh you're not at the other thing yet
<a:PecoKarylLick:710282270015225996>

who needs characterization when you have this
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so
well no name given tho
pls dont click spoiler if you're anime only
i'm just eh after the ||other death||
i havent actually read much of grimgar so idk boul
yes
^
they're depressing
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
<:LulucoWhy:642850398394122260>
<:harold:671899719940833291>
grimgar lns
ah seven
it was either them or one peace i was thinking lol
yen only shows me the manga
is it yen?
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
cypher do you knwo who's publishing grimgar in english
s1 was good ol satelight
nope
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
~~v3 is where the real pain begins~~
go read volume 3 cypher <:15min:655058014495047690>
what can go wrong
anime about a fart
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
Onara Gorou
you know what you guys need in your life
and precure ofc
maybe antartica and yuru camp were slightly better
pte is the best show of 2018
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
and pop team epic
<:15min:655058014495047690>
or yama no susume
a hot take
it is
me neither
heh
hardly finished anime in that
2012 was actually my worst year ever
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
not counting sequels of stuff or delayed spring shows its just lapis relights, deca dence, nihon chinbotsu, god of high school
👀
so what did you want to ask
<:15min:495770478678638593>
you cant buy me aya
hmm?
i only read like 4 or 5 total
idk the popular ones on line tbh
as long as cr and line webtoons are doing their partnership then it shouldn't be that difficult for more webtoons to get anime with the amount of contacts cr has in the industry nowadays
would be more of the other way tbh
it's one of the webtoons ive actually been reading
~~cypher you would love volume 10~~
still cute
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
damn never knew they released a new pv for it in april
<:lul:542837203840008193>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcGqZZdVAAEWGJX?format=jpg&name=small
the movie was just a big spoilerfest if you only saw the anime and dint read the ln lol
yeah
<:15min:655058014495047690>
in s2 you mean
Lina
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EcGqYpoVAAA-vCH?format=jpg&name=small
talking about oni-sama
everyone can be killed in the face of tatsuya <:15min:655058014495047690>
he just doesnt want to do it
its not hard tho
yeah
considering tatsuya things he does in future volumes?
nah he aint more op then tatsuya <:LUL:545650745534447631>
just demon high school
its literally mahouka btw
ep1 is supposed to be 28 mins as opposed to the regular 25 so that possibility exists
eas
ssj or SSJ
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
dw
you'll drop it at v10
275483 for coalgirls
69121 for thora
thora has 6 or so iirc
there's probably a more recent torrent but i aint gonna go through all of ubw and hf and stuff
<:lul:542837203840008193>
there's eh [a-S] Fate Stay Night (01-24) (1080p) 
[Coalgirls]_Fate_Stay_Night_(1280x720_Blu-ray_FLAC)
[Exiled-Destiny] Fate Stay Night (Dual Audio)
Fate_Stay_Night_(2006)_[720p,BluRay,x264]_-_THORA

for options
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
zero isnt really meant to be watched first
seeders on the other hand <:15min:655058014495047690>
there's a few
though i think they're releasing kimetsu with funi in a standard 60 bucks version
Aniplex uses jp pricing so they're always gonna be more costly then other western publishers.
i would just grab the thora one
<:15min:655058014495047690>
we didnt know beforehand they would do that tho
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
Vstarz Enterprise apparently went legal
yeah i know
someone hasnt been reading the announcements <:15min:655058014495047690>
i enjoy the leads very much but i also have issues that literally every male in the series is a bad person
its trash but its fun to read, carol
you're talking about ``JK Haru is a Sex Worker in Another World`` hanabi
>Sexiled: My Sexist Party Leader Kicked Me Out, So I Teamed Up With a Mythical Sorceress!
nah
which is also an issue on itself
female lead and all the males are bad
<:15min:655058014495047690>
you would probably like sexiled then carol, not that it has anime
same
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
that said Lapis is gonna be a trove of funny faces, at least if they keep doing them for the remainder of the eps
maybe something changes throughout volume 2 but im currently reading not!overlord
<:15min:406862587657977866>
its spring part 2
there's no summer season tho
still pretty OP tho
i like him more so far then i do ainz
he's like ainz but in his sword persona
im only on the first volume still
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
https://puu.sh/G67fS.jpg
and then last volume of sexiled
i wanna finish the volumes for not!overlord first
gonna be a while before i read it tho
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
and with those points i bought not!overlord
which i did
so i got enough points to buy grimgar for free
and it was another 50%
and the books you buy with points (1point = 1 yen) also give you points
you're supposed to only get 50% points on your first purchase
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so i got all of grimgar for free also
the point crap is stil lfucked up
cypher you know i pmed you
most people i know do
well its time for me to spend some hours on lycoris
no
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

cows can also roll
so just roll with it
i would have called it s2 myself but they called the second half s2 <:15min:655058014495047690>
they just chose to do it this way
i get what you mean tho
its labeled as s3 so <:15min:655058014495047690>
yer
all is right in the world
bookworm is getting a s3
>I really can't imagine writing an entire story around some patch job you did as teen to make it into a contest.

thats like literally all popular lns tbh
<:15min:655058014495047690>
and they never really mentioned in alo on the final fight
random sidequest but it also explains how kirito was able to summon excaliber
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
it are no pigs or chickens yeah lol

<:harold:364119409620418591>
while using that whip
do you really not remember the adult walking on four and ekatarina riding her
fun trash at least
same

<:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
ln ye
granted i do hope it's not gonna be a blabla let's duel every ep though that's gonna get stale real fast
and ep 2 had the castle
on misfits ep 1 esp ||i was laughing my ass off when he kept reviving and killing the bully||
<:obama:461648244049707012>
we back in 2014 with all the op mc high school anime
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
misfits so far was fun
what did he say
> The guru has spoken <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
I'm more interested in the behind scene then actual anime nowadays.
DNA usually just works as a subcontractor instead of producing something themselves.
> looks like an entirely new studio
It's actually like 14 years old at this point?
<:LulucoSad:239759303429455875>
I'm just watching it for the action, the plot itself is just pretty basic
i am
it's also one of my most fav shows ever which makes it easier
the only iyashikei i could binge was tamayura bcs i lose all sense if time when watching it
same
that's their point anyway
sol is already bad enough but the subgenre in this is worse
its by far the worst entry to even binge
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
binging Iyashikei shows
heh
<a:15min:490152321817247750>
komisan is bad anyway so not like we're missing much with it having no anime
it's only getting one bcs it's anniversary anyway
10000 years
<a:15min:585535714943434770>
<:RadioDoubt:595727226650230815>

@
i never liked it since day 1
but I'm fine with it as it is anyway, just a slouch to get through
<a:15min:585535714943434770>
but half of 8 is 4
2 is too low
i would half it
12*
brave references s1 ye
brave doesn't matter that much when you watch it
road to Berlin is a sequel to it so you should probably watch it before that starts
the movie was nice
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
you aint suppose to do this
im yoshika so i can do this
well yoshika is the walking miracle magic wise
yah
like her last op was brave witches
its nice that they got ishida back for the OP
i do actually like yoshika
<:15min:655058014495047690>
tho its a duo with eila
sanya for me
they all have skirts
>luminous witches seems kind of strange

yeah they arent pantless <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yeah luminous is the idol one
then we have eh luminous witches somewhere in 2021 and the second gag one also in 2021
road to berlin is in october

World Witches Take Off!
yep
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
you'll get both of them in the same anime soon
sorry cyph but i do actually like kamille
Setsuna is clearly best gundam protag, he's i am gundam after all <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
yes its correct
song literally starts with it
```ARE YOU READY!!
I'M LADY!!
始めよう
やれば出来るきっと
絶対私NO.1```
>"i'm ready, i'm a lady"

thats correct btw
hlj doesnt show older orders <:think_jii:688734639094890520>
well time to buy another rufus version
https://www.hlj.com/frame-arms-girl-hresvelgr-rufus-agito-kbyfg-076
april 2020 <:think_jii:688734639094890520>
there's multiple rufus versions
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
my hresvelgr invert has stronger plastic then my hresvelgr rufus
koto really depends on their run
and then when the work rush was over it sort of was just laying there
iirc i started it but then work became super busy so didnt got time to continue
she still has no arms or legs
i did the body and stopped
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
ive been building this one hresvelgr for 2 years now <:LUL:545650745534447631>
me neither
oh hlj has a new version i think i dont have
frame arms girl
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
but i only buy hresvelgr
i dont mind buying fags
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
it aint a cute girl
i wouldnt buy it either
<:obama:461648244049707012>
they just removed the animal  spirits in the anime
which grant them the magic and they take on the ears/tails
>magic making you animal people is weird but okay
in the other sources they have animal  spirits
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
thats an option i did before yeah
<:15min:655058014495047690>
>how do you go about that?
make the joint bigger
granted its easy enough to fix yourself
my only problem is the neck on the frame arms tbh
well they updated the site in 2018 so perhaps older orders just didnt transfer over to the new system
<a:triggeredField:427811541455470602>
~~damn setsuna isn't mecha~~
japan uses mecha as a broader term then we do tbf
> imagine a world where urasawa got a good adaptation
das a big dream
<:ainyagasm:585598637246119945>
at least in the anime
same tbh
i shouldn't have scrolled up to see some of the quality takes <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
till 66
63 shemmy
and shit
one of my early ones was actually gatchaman
>spiderman cartoon lol
<:concern:250363568694755329>
well not counting you mel
<:harold:364119409620418591>
am i the only one who watched 60s anime
you guys should watch midori
for all the wrong reasons but still<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
shoujo midori is the best show pre 2000
it's also delayed to next year iirc so rip
hopefully the other ito anime will be better
the rest of the adapted stories were meh
tomie was good tbh and that was the only one i actually remember something about
yeh ito collection was meh
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
and a lot of required bleach
if you want trashy horror
<a:MikuHyperDelete:729379613180166184>
https://cdn.myanimelist.net/images/anime/13/77662.jpg
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
but you'll need bleach
dw lank just watch midori
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
damn and the ep was already good
<:RadioDoubt:595727226650230815>
make it an anime game and bam removed
have a not anime game, add pantsu shots in it and it will be okay
pretty much though
steam not even being consistent with their own ruling is the most annoying part of it
<:15min:655058014495047690>
steam is shit for anything anime but for the rest its aight
which honestly sucks bcs vrv player as rather decent
ye
vrv is owned by cr's parent company
it has both cr and hidive so
if you have access to vrv is probably your best bet
it's just ass for the users
why would they put shows on a rival stream website when they have their own
it makes sense for sentai tbh
most of them are still on hidive and vrv
but das not fate jeanne
heh
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i would be tempted for a jeanne or a mash tho
as much as i love rem, i wouldnt buy a life size of her
yeah
Yūki Yūna wa Yūsha de Aru Churutto!
but its a gag anime centered on the mobage
>anime adaptation of the mobage. 😛
they are though
it went into effect yesterday
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-07-31/crunchyroll-removes-77-sentai-filmworks-titles/.162420
yes thats normal
and some banger ops/eds
the soundtrack on ft is probably the best asset it has
im trying to find the pic
and apparently if you have something with yuri on it you arent eligible
and for each one of them you need to fulfill certain things. on the discovery one you have this one

they released a new system on discord and you can change your type of server to discovery, community etc
~~yuri is a forbidden word~~
did you hear about discord yet though
2d based artstyles bad
its literally the same thing as steam
same thing as what steam is doing
for like 3 hs now <:LUL:545650745534447631>
watching hero aca movie 2 atm
but yeah anime club
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
it was nice seeing the producer of the game also taking in western opinions for improvements though
they fixed most of the major issues now but they really shouldnt have happened.
but just dont get me started on lycoris bcs that was a yikes at release
i can get more pantsu shots in the sao lycoris game then in the ft rpg
its not even bad
it were just lucy pantsu shots
all of them
nope
yes cypher
pc/xbox/ps/switch
over every platform
reminds me that the fairy tail rpg had a day 1 patch to remove all of the pantsu shots
my hero academia's second movie
yeah heroes rising
instead of an ass towards everyone
be friendly
man why can't bakugo be in the show like he was in this movie
<:chkgoodbye:551831165598957568>
back to the movie now
oh found it, this isnt really the place for it but eh
https://puu.sh/GdHDN.png
https://puu.sh/GdHFp.png
i finished 2 out of 3 volumes for SP
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
it's just KR putting ep 1 on yt
or should be doing close to all of s1
so sacrifices will have to be made
they're doing all of s1 in 13 eps
they're non important details so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
and insert mori triple kick sucks ass comment
reminds me i should check twitter comments under the goh acc to see how the source fanboys are saying how shit the fights are compared to the source
like i said, they should have just not have done the wedding arc and instead done an original ep and just include mira getting hurt and the sword stolen.
It literally wouldn't make a difference.
not that they did a proper job of what it exactly was
and nothing that was important besides the sword that was stolen
well yes bcs they sure as hell werent gonna dedicate 2-3 eps to a shitty arc lol
all they had to get across is the sword getting stolen so they should have just made it an og story lol
much better ep then last weeks <a:15min:585535714943434770>
it's literally his character
but he would
literal joke char vs anything <:whomstve:423625706648371210>
the saitama vs literally anything are the most fun
at least his wife finished her manga<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
he and his wife roll in money
then again not like togashi ever has to write again
same thing with hxh author and dq lol
beserk author is a notorious big imas fan so ye
idolmaster
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
imas game almost releases
he won't be playing wow for much longer
but it was fun
i don't remember anything about it though
saga was fun
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
saitama, goku, etc ones are just boring
at least those are some what fun
<:useless:272874872416370689>
a la aria, amanchu, danmachi
you just need to get some passionate staff
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
might be fine tbf
railgun is easier to adapt <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
big brain move
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
and keep the same staff
well at least they're consistent
i would rather they not <:15min:655058014495047690>
but the basics come from OT which they royally fucked over
and take their time
they can sort of reset if they ever do a NT adaptation
the anime is never gonna be good though
<:15min:655058014495047690>
you heard it here first
everything is an asspull therefore none of it is
eh
if you ignor everything else
thats literally railgun
<:15min:655058014495047690>
but you were fire
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
haha
heh thats a first
so like 90% of the time
she just ruined my watching experience whenever she was on screen
least in the anime
Lefiya
she want even the lead in so
no not ais
and suffocating to watch
the lead was just bad
how did you even like sword oratoria
but the staff is passionate about it which usually tends to help qua adaptation
i like the ost the most but s2 was sort of meh to me also
same
granted 2 of them are sato as director so people just come to him <:LUL:545650745534447631>
assault lily im not sure
adachi was already announced to be funimation
we didnt even had clubs <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
how can they be bad when they didn't have one in the first place
well
> A new girl/guy join a school/club, they are bad but need to win the tournament to save their school/club. They train and thanks to the power of friendship and hype they win

they did twist this formula a bit. Miho was never bad at at it.
both are legimate sports in their world so idk why you wouldn't call either one of them sports
fangs are cute but like dont make it a flesh fang
<:15min:655058014495047690>
complaining about the boobs when the real issue is the flesh fang
its not exactly something what i would consider a cat but yes
sugoi dekai
2!
https://twitter.com/FGOAP_ep6/status/1292728246111354881?s=20
it can be really heavy handed on its themes at times
yeah
which can sometimes be hard to read
i prefer a centaurs life <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
then again the full color pages are like flesh fang and the regular art is like regular fang
they changed it to a flesh fang on the anime
pretty sure uzaki has a regular fang in the manga
brace doesnt help with that <:15min:655058014495047690>
flatten it
the tip i mean
western folks tend to go to the dentist to smoothen them
and if you follow seiyu's there's quite a few that have fangs
<:15min:655058014495047690>
i have a fang
>but then regular fang makes it look like the character needs to see a dentist asap
then again regular fangs are a thing irl
arent all mc of teasing manga, devils <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
~~im just enjoying the sugoi dekai memes~~
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>

just in general, not just in index or railgun
electricity is the best and i don't have bias at all<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
watts and volts aren't that big a problem

Air is their best vn
for now
<:pepegunR:708017743244558456>
im not even sure if its in the vn tbh
pls hanabi
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
should be spoiler free, it's only the song
https://youtu.be/ZOIW97jbFw4
oh on the topic of air
was pretty good tbf
remake?
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
> Considering I love the other two Key/KyoAni adaptations
there's 2 versions
~~watch h2o~~
air is one of their better anime, bit worse as an actual vn
it was half a joke
wow that's meh
ive seen worse design
but tbf could have adjusted the shirt physics and make the eyes smaller and call it a day.
i still hate how mobile only shows the first pic only instead of multiple
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
i don't like the hands
<a:illyadance:538268866380300288>
gotta go to work first, will post the trailer when i arrive
more then a traditional one at least
yeh
and the newest announced anime is full cgi
later imas entries do use cgi on music
only og and cg don't have cgi
well
<a:15min:585535714943434770>
banger op but the rest was meh tbh
it wouldnt be the first time they pun a name
so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
well aqours is also said as aqua
<@262326868366065664> should be this one
https://youtu.be/9LqorPTZxQE
there's a gag gfl anime ye
yes
> Liz is legit better than Hibike
it focuses on the better chemistry also
kyoani certainly made them bigger in the anime tbh
actual gay spinoff
liz is
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
>hibike yuri
god bless anime only viewers
even worse lanks
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
jail the theme song would still be that one gochiusa song for me
and ex monogatari
> Didn’t they get a new director for s2 of fire force it’s not a former shaft  director now
yeah but all of the regulars are still ex shaft
gemba on the other hand burned and crashed bcs of director shenigans
the 2d art was good
and tbf on berserk remake, millipensee did good
technically shaft but ye davidpro
<a:15min:490152321817247750>
deen very consistent in the wrong side of the spectrum
not many shows let people star uncorrected
teekyuu is animated very well though
> WF's strategy is basically to buy huge licences and make passable anime. They're far from the best studio, they're not the worst, but they mostly get by on the size of their LPs and passable work.
mappa is better at that
madhouse is funnier to talk about
they're not a bad studio though
wf didn't even do rezero best eps anyway <:LUL:243896110001684480>
doesn't mean it's not white fox in general
<a:15min:490152321817247750>
that's white fox in general tho
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
so it could always turn to shit
you could be gohands
well
with other issues
it's just a filter crancked up to 11
art style is nice but it actually being gorgeous? nah
>ngnl gorgeous <:whomstve:423625706648371210>
i don't think the imagery always has to match
i saw too much shows to remember ops/eds anyway
i just skip if i dont like the song or visuals
heh
ye ep 3 sounds like it
starts in july, fire was 18 july
for a bit
i was sure it's ep 3 they completely delayed

> <@!152896851660505088> I do remember seeing buzz about the differences between the manga and show
same but im usually whatever, different mediums so just do what it does best in said media. <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
<a:15min:490152321817247750>
the broly super movie
<:JustFine:256624508025307137>
goku is at his best in the broly movie tbh
normally you would just edit the movies into 25min eps
well kudos to them for still reanimating it
super suffers a lot from remaking the movies tbf
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
can we get fit buu back
poor buu
they damaged gohan
super didn't do anything with goku tho
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
there's a guy called gohan in super but its not gohan from db/z
they didn't evzn remember who gohan was <a:15min:490152321817247750>
there's not much goku gohan shit in super tho
but frieza would be best dad <:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
rather goku as father then vegeta tbf
frieza is just good
then he became a gold meme
until he trains
frieza is the epitome of no training anyway
why would he dodge <:15min:655058014495047690>
super early eps is prime example of what happens when you use people under training without any supervisor
<:asahiclown:712676042569023549>
super is basically i study i forgot fight
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
but atleast then he knew how to fight still
and you say gohan in buu arc hanabi
~~and super gave us quality memes~~ granted they didn't work for like 80% of the show
with good char acting during fights that the tv series for super was missing
but yeh the super movie is just a delight of a slugfest movie
tho super movie retcons it anyway
bardock yeh
they were until super
no coc n o
it looks fairly bad in combat
the aura is too digital
perfected should have been imperfect with clsoed eyes <:15min:655058014495047690>
both have issues
super tv is fine <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
i dont think toei would go movie only for db tbh
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
they just havent announced it
im pretty sure toei is already working on something db super
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
sugita as in ver
but i forgot
yes
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
and the third wheel is sugita
yeah broly gf <:15min:655058014495047690>
she plays a character
<:nanashades:715207337782018088>
new movie also has nana
ask master roshi for it
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
bcs he doesnt know how
just tanking it blank isnt as cool as the cooler one tbh
its fine like this

ah the shrodingers madoka movie
so never
~~time to actually catch up~~
👀
the recap episode iirc?
its in the show
only 3 eps left for sao but yeh
bcs the code is his name
who made the shitty code stuff iirc
871 is the name of the guy
it's the codename for the project crap
nah
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
only 3 weeks left so pretty close to that
~~and people think index had it bad with jc staff~~
the zero one? yeah
anime sucks
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
it's why she's on the first spot
louise is the best one on there btw
i rather had more umineko (or remake) or his newest game adapted btw cyph
<:nanashades:715207337782018088>
more like bigtsundere
mini bcs they're smoll?
2000s tsundere
what are we
in worst case cypher we could play ~~princess connect 3~~ higurashi gacha
but i gonna get to see the twins again so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
and the rounded faces
and I'm still not on board with the soft color pallete on the characters
well depends on what they're gonna adapt but the trailer has been missing atmosphere
<:asahiclown:712676042569023549>
the old one is gonna be better though
I'm still sure they're baiting though
nothing major and nothing to fill out a minimum of 24 eps with
the only stuff left you could do in an ova or 4
there's like nothing new to adapt in 24 eps though
but everything shown so far is old stuff ~~and bait~~
yeah
might as well wait at this point
so yes
<:harold:364119409620418591>
yes and yes
~~everything is fair game now that interspecies reviewers exists~~
heh
shouldn't there be enough material to adapt anyway?
they only skipped one route
well Clannad made it work <a:15min:490152321817247750>
adapting most of them works if you know what you're doing
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
fast forward a few years till current time and the next in line to become a master is a little girl
this reminds me that the author got ridiculed for writing a shogi ln with loli's to become masters.
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
ryuo has more shogi then 3gatsu
probably bcs it's fairly loli
already got anime
right on the head
https://tenor.com/view/anime-ore-gairu-my-youth-romantic-comedy-is-wrong-as-iexpected-komachi-gif-17772504
neither are best girl tho <:15min:655058014495047690>
i would put it in shounen yea
but i know what happens anyway but its fun trash
i like watching it but i also think it has some pretty severe issues <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
most of the fights are fun but you can just watch those on yt or something and not bother with the anime
and quite boring tbh
nothing really happens this season anyway
just get stolen and reappears prev ep
the sword was important, just nothing happens
well that was the problem
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
and then it sort of just showed up randomly when it got stolen
yeah all you have to know from that one is the national treasure
the filler one was actually important but they fucked it up
<:RadioDoubt:595727226650230815>
which they are directing
not counting magia record at least
>yeah Gekidan Inu Curry
yeah everything witch related is done by them
thats real life stuff
:^)
<:15min:655058014495047690>
then precure is also dark
i would think about tutu and utena first hand
and nanoha wouldnt even be on my mind
i can see where solo is coming from though?
so its just a big coincidence
yeah but ep 1 storyboards would be finished before madoka even aired
i remember
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
madoka was in production before gear was in production tho
<:harold:595434251286085653>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
nanoha would be somewhere in the middle imo
<:MoCulture:312659269570920459>

not surprised
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
worked out pretty well eh
<:RadioDoubt:595727226650230815>
touma dad pretty smart then
you gotta be fucked in the head for even to get in aca city
<:15min:655058014495047690>

anyone who lives in academy city is fucked in the head

saturday is last ep of alicization so i would guess announcement then
so it being anime for progressive is highly likely
its on the aniplex server that also hosts the new website for natsume book of friends, hortensia, the horimiya anime etc
which is alright
its progressive tho
nope
i hope people like more sao anime bcs you're likely gonna get more sao anime
the first problem is ednicha on 1

<:harold:595434251286085653>
i wish it was just a comedy thing
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
just the start of the next arc
it shows up at the end of s2
🥦
i just want to see
y
yea
its more about mob
there's like one final arc left
mob ended on the start of the next arc iirc
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
unlike the time between 1 and 2
at least mizushima already confirmed he's working on 4
yeah

gup das finale ep 3 in spring 2021
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
well its just a leak so wait til lactual announcement
<:stare:282277202060378133>
<:JustFine:256624508025307137>
s1 had better animation
but kirito still only sees asuna
and tbf sao does flirt with a lot of the girls
yeah
you dont really change the series title
bcs its the series title
but i also understand you can't do 1:1 adaptations
i way like the lns more then the anime adaptation for alicization
oh def heart
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
the anime robbed asuna of all of her scenes
<:15min:655058014495047690>
see s3
she's also pretty dumb
s1 still the best
<:393min:652628199926267930>
tanya is pretty decent from what ive heard
if this goes on all i have to do is post emojis
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
the seed is by far the most important thing that came from sao still
and alicization
there's only 1 other studio who is as extreme with it as ufo and its gohands
not to the extend of how ufotable
its still digital processed
if you take away the digital processing nothing in ufotable actually stands out animation wise
and while impressive its still shit <:15min:655058014495047690>
its ufotable so i know how it looks

following an idol
its about me as a female
though deca dance probably up there when it finishes
so eh fro mwhat i finished this year probably rn bofuri or budokan
how long ago did you watch anime jeez
yeah but thats like so 2018 <:15min:655058014495047690>
eh if i look at this year idk really
but for something i actually finished so far
and dumb fun is good
bcs its dumb fun
mao rn <:LUL:545650745534447631>
ongoing or finished
its one of the stuff that really hurts with the adaptation
it just doesnt flow as well in the anime

there's lots of them tbh
gotta appeal to both sides
<:15min:655058014495047690>
one with male lead and one with female lead
well 2 technically
there's a fate stage play lol
but its something you must like
stage plays/musicals are fun to watch
saki live action
its actually pretty good
^
not like hollywood version
japanese live action yeah
im sure china money raked in a lot for the latest ones but they also did good in the west
even when its shit
its still a big blockbuster
yes
transformers was big everywhere
saki live action is good tho
scroll a bit up cypher
but its good to see progressive anime confirmed
so it could be anything reki <:LUL:545650745534447631>
and straightedge is an anime producer company
straightedge producer mentioned more reki related announcements are planned
accel world
well there might be still hope for AW then

well assault was one of them already
like the production is really bad even for shaft standards
dates dont mean anything to shaft <:LUL:545650745534447631>
~~they already delayed assault lily and it might get delayed again~~
first announcement related to reki is a niconico channel <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:harold:595434251286085653>
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
well its better then regular yes
its just a slowburner with more focus on asuna
mappa itself didnt do anything
for a few scenes in a few eps
its only 1 of their directors that helped ikuhara
yeah except they didnt do a single episode
its fake advertising
mappa didnt even work on sarazanmai
everything has the same aesthetic on mappa shows, it sucks
>gachashit from mappa
never watched it
lapis is a good example of how much it helps when shows have a good schedule and are finished months beforehand
and a lot of character acting and quirks which you wouldnt really expect coming in on this show
the eps i watched have been pretty good yeah
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
charlotte is best is
and s2 is the big pile of turd
im with cypher tho that s1 is still bad but alright
that explains everything
isnt that the eh sleep girl thing
sentai is one of the few US ones who arent
~~also 2015 iirc~~
funi has also been doing it for eons
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
they have been funding shows since 2015 but dont let anyone tell you
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
like yurucamp and antartica
and some of the better shows i enjoyed the past few years have been funded by cr
like in theory if animelogs starts adding new shows it could be a show that cr helped fund
cr is already part of the japanese industry so it would never do anything
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
no
they did
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iOaaNJ7c4cA&feature=emb_title
doga is doing action ~~yaoibait~~ this season
actually no
and B/C is also working on heroaca iirc
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
do believe
Bones A project is still unannounced
iirc this is Bones B
god forbid a studio outputing different kinds of shows
Josee looks amazing
yeah
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
too bad for them its the people who worked on those shows also working on this show
yes .they're very stupid

some of the ann comments have been amusing to say the least
i like utsumi but skating isnt really my thing
i dont think im gonna watch it either
Utsume (free, BF director) doing new project
https://twitter.com/sk8_project/status/1307605419704094720
oh right <@!238855496797257729> talkign bout banana fish
same
before airing people actually thought it was gonna be like lilybear and be like split ~50/50 with ikuhara's studio doing half and the other studio doing half
but its free advertisement <:LUL:545650745534447631>
~~there was only melodrama in ep10~~
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
violet was like an exception
only in japan its weekly
they do it in europe also tbh
they have just been outbuying licenses to stream
and its like an ova
their first actually funded anime comes out in november
thats the difference
netflix hasnt funded a single show yet <:15min:655058014495047690>
unlike netflix and such
it was more to show as how much they have been ingrained in the industry already
urahara was liek the first they branded as cr original
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
ofc there is
its mostly about those cr originals that make people mad yeah <:15min:655058014495047690>

<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<a:15min:490152230561906688>
and by that i mean they put like 10 volumes in 2 ova's
anime tackled most of it either way
ln finished tho
yes

asterisk
well be glad
asterisk is A1 iirc
and i didnt even back for the digital <:LUL:545650745534447631>
and i dont want to digital version
i say should because they will probably fire people again <:LUL:545650745534447631>
and after that it should be kodomo no jikan phys releases
at least they're  almost done with kimiorange road w/e its called
dmp is just a shit company
its been 5 years
the physical copies are not released yet at all
i backed it on kickstarter <:15min:655058014495047690>
yes
they sort of have send out digital copies yea
yet
they did not
NO
~~one day dmp will release the manga~~
<a:Clappers:642297018383073300>
dont forget the ova's
well hanabi imagine remembering stuff from 8 years ago
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
its decent ye
i like the ln tho
its mostly fanservice with hina
everything else is put in 2 ovas
the tv series is normal adaptation
nah
she gets one in miner event
serena has no personality in innocent sisters <:15min:655058014495047690>
~~all of them~~
<:harold:671899719940833291>
so they might not take it
bandai wants to focus on original content
maybe at a different studio
get over it, cyph
stella is in the better show
<a:15min:490152230561906688>
welcome to hell
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
what for tho
are you on a trip back to the 80s hanabi?
s1 was pretty lit
wasnt that fond of s2
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
i ver much enjoyed the shovel
kamasama was alright
but it has lots of females
yes
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
you can't miss it
> I'm guessing Kyoani adapted Clannad pretty faithfully unlike JC with Little Busters right?
yeh
it's related to the dormkeeper girl
the character doesn't really appear in the anime
nah not sunohara got an arc
just the blondie guy not sunohara arc and a better explanation of the light orbs
you didn't miss that much
the fun
bit yeh go read tomoyo after hanabi
ive read too many
yeh
it's a minigame in the vn
you have to play it yourself
wait till you're at the baseball game
hanabi
best girl gets own vn
the manga is based on that
it did
it's mostly based on the true ending
if you want to read it read the 4 chapter manga of tomoyo after hanabi
yeh
where ||the bad ends are happy||
bar tomoyo after
the true route endings tend to be happy ends though
yeah but its also not a vn tbf
key is depressing? but all of their stuff have a happy true end
<:asahiclown:712676042569023549>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
> By the end of a Key show I'm usually more happy than depressed
read tomoyo after and say that again
<:asahiclown:712676042569023549>
I'll always savescum
<a:15min:490152321817247750>
it's why i savescum in vns
if you miss it, you have to go back to a prev save
<:LUL:243896110001684480>
it's one of the requirements to get the true end
it would work better if they picked something else then kyoani <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
well bets girl is komachi so i can't deny it
well she wasnt evne best girl <:15min:655058014495047690>
damn that audio sucks
<:15min:655058014495047690>
best muv luv?
~~and its me asking it so you know what its gonna be~~
its a deep one so think hard
but cypher asnwer the question <:LUL:545650745534447631>
best muv luv?
~~you always have the worst character taste anyway~~
the twist was great
<:15min:655058014495047690>
i liked s3 the most
that def got worse
fight me
s3 is the best shana season
both of them have an ending but the worst girl has the true end<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
closing chapter is the best part tho
lanks should be glad wa2 never got a full adaptation
>pokelabo x bushiroad
soon™️

its this
wrong
there's only one answer anyway
reki will just start a new series or continue with progressive
yeh
volume per volume sao beats it so easily
ln wise index only has more bcs it has 40 books more
<:Ver:704169051391524875>

f isn't gonna work
and 3+1 is also stupid
i still hate 1.0 and 1.11 naming etc
pls no eva naming again
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
but kongo is best girl
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
enjoyed the lns more then the part of index i read, not that thats saying much
HO was fun
<:15min:655058014495047690>
well perhaps in october then
whens next dengekifest actually
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
yeh but then people will read too much into it and spread wrong info
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
~~he's talking bout the ln anyway~~
yeah
being freelancers can do that <:15min:655058014495047690>
yues its same staff but at a different studio
she knows some self defense stuff but that was it iirc
lucy didnt do that much if you remove her keys
but yeah like
you mean by plot armor ruby <:15min:655058014495047690>
lucy didnt exactly do much shit <:LUL:545650745534447631>
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
and so was everything after the 7 year gap
end was wasted
lacus tho <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
i just told you the best ep <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:RubyCry:356677866957570048>
sudden sister
mira and man at graveyard
no ep beats that one
<:15min:655058014495047690>
the best ep is the ep where the sister comes back
then again gildarts was fts literal walking oh shit button
and gildarts <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
that also
i think lucy was a good char but underutilized for the most part
<:15min:655058014495047690>
iirc
most of it is original
its at least 1 novel adapted
<:15min:655058014495047690>
none
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
every day feels like a deja vu
ob <@139432096023183360> did you hear yet that Non is likely gonna quit illustrating adachi
ye funi is late
too bad it isn't gonna be delayed more<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
does anyone have a funi account?
```go check the first episode of assault lily on their site
and take a screenshot of the cat's paw in the opening```
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
mio you're in the wrong anime
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496650964384743434/761371269034934292/ffJWYHx.png
only 4 months till januari
but yeah i hope non will keep on drawing
it's all for the families
hata refused
they didn't use any of it for the studio
and Insurance doesn't cover everything
they do but everything was gone
yeh
she donated like half of her life savings to them
then the fire happened last year.
they made her do illustrations for it and she liked doing that so she quit kyoani and started illustrating
she was part of kyoani up until chuunibyou
kyoani fire broke her
she wants to quit illustrating
not sure if she's still gonna do that
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
didn't buy it yet
yeah but drawings itself idk
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
it's also just strike witches but focusing on thighs instead of ass.
assault lily, this was alright. Op was good, bless junpei from elements garden. ED was also pretty good. Both also were directed by nagahara (you might know him from kyoani shows), esp in the ed you notice the influences and in some scenery shots. Action scenes were pretty decent. characters well.... not really a fan of the designs. Granted they don't even have a cohesive design as over half of the shots they look different then what they're supposed to look like so I guess they only did minimal correction due to time constraints, covid maybe? but that doesn't really bode well on first episodes and its not intentional a la konosuba.
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
well cypher, erai has been like that for over a year and they're still running
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
use erai and eh equivalents now
HorribleSubs died btw so sail the seas
the show has other issues anyway but its part of it's charm
it's just a fun fact
yeh
white correct

just look at the catpaw
they're both owned by aniplex
wakanim is funi
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
it's just shaft things
it's easier to notice side by side
ye funi has the wrong one then
on the plus side it's also before ghosting and dimming are applied

idk which version funi got tho
missing sfx, wrong colored, the whole title animation was missing
so the op is all fucked up
they send the wrong master
next week
for assault lily
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
atleast i hope they gave the correct op to streaming services i hope
at least from the op it looks like it will spice things up a bit?
yeah
they hardly even played them
rezero 2 is actually gonna be the pain in amq
it starts slow and it ramps up
same
also fun stuff in the op

<:obama:461648244049707012>
not even halfway in and tonikawa already namedropped the shows name
yeah ed is fine
yeah the lily ed is <:JustFine:256624508025307137>
only makes it a good screenshot show
too bad it doesnt save the show
there's a lot of it
gacha was announced same time as anime iirc
https://puu.sh/Gzfcq.png

our pokelabo boys aer growing <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i love love live but not niji
im not even sure if im actually gonna watch or follow the next mainstream one in super stars
which frankly idc about
niji is bushi's own group they created as a thing to be in their gacha games
sunshine isnt a spinoff
just dont like the spinoff girls
¯\_(ツ)_/¯
i like love live but f*ck niji
im not watching it
im sure he is
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
like 10 years ago
i liked it
drop the ones you think are weaker
~~its okay to be wrong~~

ah yes
one of the pilots
the bald with shades at the end
mafia voices the mafia looking guy
<@87512939107450880>
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
> were best characters of the episode
did you like mafia?
until sw comes out ofc <:LUL:545650745534447631>
same
im in bcs its from the hayate author and i loved that one
what
i assume the backend is too old
and AT focuses on vrv so that has the better player
AT fired crs own IT and outsourced it
they dont have devs lol
i would 2
at least they have the partnership with cr atm
and they have like 5 shows maybe this season lol
ironically sentai is the one getting funding from the jp government
nah they just have the bucks to license 80% of the anime now
all i know is that fridays are gonna be awful
then you might see it pop up earlier on the free sails
unless funi has leak problem again
friday
same
im more worried about it melting then like that tbh
hard to gauge from pvs how they're gonna tackle the inner monologue
gjm has a guy who literally redraws frames for typesetting
i know someone who would be crazy enough to do that for fansubs
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
would be fun to see in a show itself, just not in the op only
some do it for openings with the credits
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
make it really meta
or in a book she's reading
or the uniform
add the text on the thighs and stuff
make it a super cute still image and like
why not go more extreme
i mean i would rather had a shaft take then tezuka
<:lul:542837203840008193>
most of the times it gets cut bcs its a hassle to deal with
yeah fenny
JB has been one of my fav shows in the past 5 years and that one literally melts while you're watching it
at least all they have to do is keep the story intact and ill be a happy man
its functional but it wouldnt surprise me that its gonna melt
and black wants nobody
brown wants pink and pinks wants black
AL gonna be awkard

and it sucks bcs the visuals they draw look amazing
i have 0 trust in tezuka
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
but i dont have hope fot the anime
yeh
its a slow burn though so people shouldnt expect shit to happen straight off
what if you know most
lmao
like UTX from s1/s2 Arise was based on UDX in akiba
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
ye
it's where comiket takes place
which is japans biggest exhibition and convention center
well its not really a school in real life, the school is based on Tokyo Big Sight
that school exists
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
all under the funi umbrella
yeah
and yet they still give the middle finger to over half of europe
they have such a big monopoly
sony wants all of them under funimation
or late last year
yeah since this year
so its under funi again
they bought madman again
no
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
the catch is that anime lab is owned by funi
heh
bad taste <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
i blame solo for matchmaking
Kyon
Suzumiya Haruhi no Yūutsu
vs
Okazaki Tomoya
Clannad

this is evil
that badly edited in crown tho
my abstains get removed when i click another abstain
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
i cant abstain anymore
is their a cap on abstaining
wait
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
i voted jojo
I'm abstaining on that
so rigged
both are same va
this is rigged
nao vs kumiko
and even if i did, yui is precious
i haven't seen kaguya if you mean the first one by that
<a:15min:490152487358300160>


taste inc, yall need sunglasses so you don't get blinded
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
haven't seen the show so just selected the other entry that i did see
kaguya was easy
imagine putting the same chars against each other
you actually have to for it to count
<a:15min:490152487358300160>

the first ep of the sequel actually adapts something they skipped in the final act
mal has by far the worst database of all the trackers

https://puu.sh/GA7XQ.png
it is one of the best anime ever made
god bless
its just gonna go in circles and circles
i would jsut tap out at this point
not wrong
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
doubt that
anime is shit
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
just watch what you like and ignore people
yeah
a lot of sol are under shounen
its just demographics which can be <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
it just has to pass a moderator who would have no way to know if its true or not
and you can just add whatever to mal
they usually dont list all of them though
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
and my floor is just wooden planks
<:Nani:460465184885178368>
not yet
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
pc in front of you, behind you your bed, left to you boxes with doujins, games, posters, bds
right of you boxes full of figures, desk full of cans of cola, no door, half finished wooden wall, you can see the isolation on the ceiling
like just image it like this
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
high chance actually
or to be precise is done renovated
maybe if it gets renovated
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
im sure kantoku art helps a lot
lmao
yeah
<:15min:655058014495047690>

sw3 def saving anime this season
the only thing anno said is that the final act of the movie will be 41mins
https://godzilla-sp.jp/
the godzilla thing is real
bones x orange, april 2021 (netflix exclusive)
it's an isekai? i thought it was just a vrmmo
> didnt a wow expansion get delayed too?
yeh it did
coincidence? i think not
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
imas game delayed to next year
you know why?
honestly i liked sleeping princess but if its gonna be the same every ep i can't see me finishing it
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
~~and idol witches by shaft next year~~
and brave witches if you want a spinoff
s1>s2>movie
movie is important for miyafuji
hopefully they keep it up fo the remainder of the show
also adachi was better on the first ep then my expectations
granted a delay in materials is also shafts problem
the ep is up on wakanim, or at least it should be
it's a funi thing
can't wait for someone to watch it, post caps on twitter and japanese people will be like ?????
y
catsite?
its not supposed to be but yes
https://puu.sh/GAXKL.png
its bad for funi but not like anyone here really cares <:LUL:545650745534447631>
but like funi apparently has easy to hack servers or something so this one guy keeps pulling all of the new eps early
it shouldnt come out for another few hours
yes
every funi show is getting leaked early
out right now on the cat
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
assault lily also delayed to tomorrow for subs
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
havent tried that one yet
yes hanabi
its higurashi when they cry ~GOU~
and see the higurashi when they cry title ~NEW~ was bait
i told people there was more to the series then they let on
its not a remake
its a sequel
told you they were gonna jebait people <:15min:655058014495047690>
reminder to stop watching higurashi if you havent seen the previous series <:15min:655058014495047690>
high chance for that tbh prism
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
same
just skip over half of the sunshine movie <a:15min:490152487358300160>
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
subs
there's like 4 different groups you can get that are just straight rips
<:harold:595434251286085653>
too much anime today
like how they're doing now every year
they're probably gonna churn out some more original movies, written by oda after op ends
two piece
aqours movie is just whatever
muse movie was actually good and did something with the series
nah the songs are worth it
<a:PepoSweat:662260602143506462>
then again jc staff is also a juggernaut studio wise so eh
picked up too much shows
jc staff is going through this rn
nah for real, most pick up a lot of work but not to the point where there's a chance the whole place crashes and burns
<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>
none
they also pick up too much work but as long as they can keep churning out stuff i feel nothing is gonna change
both
it's the trash they pull behind the scenes that's awful
i also like mappa shows
mappa is awful but eh <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
the other mappa show this season
taiso samurai
💸
the zls team is doing that gymnastics anime this season btw
zls 2 is gonna happen one day but it sure aint gonna be soon
ZSL was good up until the last few eps
i like LL but the movie is just trash
it's bad tho
sounds like a steal
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
if you care about numbers
http://corp.toei-anim.co.jp/en/ir/materials/count.php?y=2020
it's also highest domestic
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
and db doesn't even have something but merch
this is for q1 2021

you can actually see how well stuff does for toei
good enough for them to keep making precure to sell toys
they have rights yeh
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
they have db
toei doesn't even need op
i had work so I'm grabbing 4hs of sleep so i can watch my girls
F
probably not bcs >paying
<@199928870810419200> are you gonna watch the concert today?
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
ye they're all a bit special
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
so it is
||usagi drop?||
<:hypersweating:659548309635072000>
watch first screenshot later
yeah dw you'll see it with ep 2
clothing animation is <:obama:461648244049707012>
im a fan of the ED
admit i wanted to see them actually singing
you're in for a ride then
ah
what ep you on atm?
yeah
its basically a walking anime encyclopedia animated
well its animegataris
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
you still need to live through another 11 eps, don't die now
<:okay:330354891727962122>
but yeah colorband is probably gonna be fixed on bds
https://puu.sh/GBBEU.png
i did do that
sec
yeah cocoa
so i did actually put both together
jp broadcast has 7eleven, intl release has it as 9shop
they "censored" 7eleven
you probably didnt catch the store change?
but nova
yeah
apparently it wasn't completely finished back in February
they're airing it again in cinema with new scenes so that's probably why
well maybe they send the materials super late to funi so a Thursday release isn't feastible anymore for them
<:EliThink:333474581761228812>
https://twitter.com/FUNimation/status/1316182737552904194
also eh
remember that it normally wouldn't have had a break
there's at minimum like 3 series that fit that description
<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>
you have to update ytdl quite a bit tho
it doesn't for some
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
instead of through the browser player
the idea is that you put the 2 together and then you can just drop your video url on mpv and you watch it on thag
<https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl/blob/master/docs/supportedsites.md>
there's some nsfw websites ^
https://mpv.io/
and it works on majority of the legal websites
youtube-dl is a thing
not using cr and watching it through mpv
khara themselves did
nope
probably better to check that each week then to watch the show
sure are
they didnt drop restrictions no<:15min:655058014495047690>
just for kimetsu
nope
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
now they put millions of people together for a movie
that's the thing they're doing "fine"
corona go brrrrrrrrrr
but apparently kimetsu is special and can ignore all of the restrictions.
indeed
they removed all restrictions they had for corona for the kimetsu movie which is?????
> and Tenet got flopped in Japan
cause theaters only had minimal attendance allowed bcs of corona
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
time to become an anituber  and spread the word of something
yesterday
yes hanabi
<:AlexJones:651281184671793163>
my opinion of you has risen
cocoa you like star driver?
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

the planes one
thsi was amazing
im making baldie my new pfp
>mahou shoujo odin
its super dumb but it such a fun idea to do this
this only made it better
https://puu.sh/GGmgP.jpg
im laughing
at the ed or the ep itself?
shows also pretty good
in todays ep
plum reference also
yeah
and you can sort of see bazett in the maid
tonikaku

https://twitter.com/CG_Orange_eng/status/1320900324538810368?s=09
tbf it are different divisions and they haven't really changed anything on funi and such so far.
like hidive lol
yeah and the others aren't as big
just having a monopoly for the most part if it goes through
i did but did amiya know?
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
why didn't you just say symphogear then
they do
it's mostly in the start of the OP, like she can't get to the correct tone she intended
probably the singer actually being retired and only came back to do op for sw
there's something that doesn't fit tbh for road to berlin
but why
i didn't finish the "sequel" yet
same
but just read the manga
ye
well no IS just yet
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
it's fun but at the same time it can have eh questionable fanservice they hammer down for several minutes
~~hack~~
(which means netflix usually)
muv luv airs in October next year on the ultra+ slot, solopy, cypher
most just gtl <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
idk
<:peepofbi:688914032966893573>
finding a good one  is hard <:15min:655058014495047690>
finding that is easy
finding a good editor is also hard
editing does wonders
lemme see if i can find the thread
there was actually a indusrial talk about mtl and translators
but he already knows jp
what its not wrong
<:15min:655058014495047690>
and guess what mtl is bad at
so does subjects
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
its probably the best thing out of the french in the last 10 years <:15min:655058014495047690>
and sentence structure in general
even deepl is better at grammar then google
just never fucking use it for grammar sentences
gtl is fine for single world lookups yeah
yeah
it might make it more readable
and editing isnt gonna fix that
that doesnt fix actual translation mistakes though <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
with the amount of knowledge i have i can barely even tl a page
and they only do some editing
majority of the fanpublished novels are just MTL
thats one out of a billion people who think they are a "translator"
the round fluffy faces do look weird
i do like the tnk version more design wise but im also okay with the new designs
which im fine with
<:15min:655058014495047690>
^
people jsut hate the artstyle switch
it did, its by far the worst looking dxd
it looked worse though <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
imagine having your previous season so bad and fileld with og content you had to spend the first few eps of your season retconning it
it was a lot betetr then what came before
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
ye they announced it today as a movie
both shitty scheduling and covid*
<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>
sunrise doesn't ever want to touch horizon again so gl
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
yes
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
lmao
Rikako Aida as Riko
<:TopClown:755508483230531585>
it's already dead <:shemhaha:720465741278871681>
they'll just keep releasing a concept movie to keep baiting people
besides maybe that one that focuses on grandpa
aint gonna watch s3 and the mini movies
yeh, I'm done with pp since s2
yes
maybe she gets better in s3
and she's awful
the girl that was under akane
2 is passable but a lot worse
if you want a good contrast just compare pp 1 with pp 2
1 has gen and 2 has tow. and Tow just doesn't have the grasp on archtypes like gen has. <a:15min:490152487358300160>
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
both
i should check out staff interviews and extra's sounds like fun having to record this <:LUL:545650745534447631>
they all treat the same storyboard but no ep is exactly the same
yeah
catching/finding all of the differences and framings in each ep was enough for me to not really be upset about it.
it was fine <:15min:655058014495047690>
the movie is easily the best part of haruhi
the original plan was to do disappearance instead but they switched it later
it for sure was not as long <:LUL:545650745534447631>
yeah it was fully reanimated every single ep
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
i still need to finish danchibro's
this is probably part of it
they already had that 10 year cg plan
vacation is the movie
precure every year
🍹
http://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/tropical-rouge_precure/
sort of
<:GenjurouLaughing:231435391935315969>
the script has only been rewritten like at least 3 times so yeah
it doesnt do anything wrong its also just not doing anything special
its just fine tbh
<:ver:749998669767376978>
so like lala in star twinkle they made ambiguous instead of just saying she's green
green doesnt sell
i hope they give us a green cure again but bandai doesn't let them use green usually <:LUL:545650745534447631>
the mermaid tail on the name is pretty <:justRight:296200936639168512>
yeah
new one gonna be best one if they give us mermaids <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
my favourite is _______________ precure
||it takes stuff from one route, stuff from the other route in HF and mixes them together iirc||
||they adapted both or so||
they were never doing a proper adaptation in 3 movies
well we already knew how it would go anyway <:LUL:545650745534447631>
~~the end is disappointing~~
tenor needs more hinata gifs
i got my friend in the hole, he hates it that i did that
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
in the end, its one more person into precure (i hope) and thats what matters
the other 2 do it much better
aois not even that good as a lead in the show
well yeah but sometimes shit just happens
it probably works well enough as an intro, its just boring for vets
well not like toei always follows the schedules they set out
yeah
gotta keep the tradition of precure in february
you know
maybe they'll just cut it short
unless they do something crazy with the final
the shows just gonna be forgotten pretty soon
digimon has the same problem rn tbf
at least some of the fun stuff is still there in the action scenes
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
they already had the new toys up for pre-order and then the delay happened so they still had to put out the new cure
there's also the delay they had that eh moved things along a bit at an awkward pace
<:flip:244638218408951808> <:flap:264123355622408202>
~~and in every option its always bad~~
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
wouldnt advice watching it on cr at all
cr has the cut dub version
probs
heartcatch is one of my favs
<a:KasuPunch2:780041677888684032>
futari wa is
just dont watch adaptations then
~~and a lot of the other shows still~~
gotta catch up with fruit tart
yeah i had a hint
i thought it was gonna be for adachi <:LUL:545650745534447631>
could probably also check the stalker pre-estimates for bds as long you keep in your head its not tracking digital and stream views
yeah
japanese forums, keeping an eye on jp media outlets if they release popular this season lists
<:fug:294311099615019008>
memes be memes, AK
<:4Head:309021916532965387>
yeah
not overly interested in it tbf
starts without lelouch but towards the end will get back to lelouch
both solopy
zof the Recapture is the subtitle for the next code geass anime project eh
not the first time that has happened :^)
but yeah its fragmented and not really tracked so you would have to wait for like the official twitter to say something
popular enough to have a billion of them <:LUL:545650745534447631>
well i was more talking bout the streaming services in japan <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
same, could still do well on streaming services though which doesn't get tracked
not bad tbf
they have been picking up a fair share of amazon licenses
sentai bought the license to s2 later yeh
so all shows on that block automatically went to amazon
they had exclusive rights on the prgramming block yuyuyu aired on.
y
for as long they have the license
yeah but they're just on prime now
yeah
i would have no problems paying for cr or funi or the likes if you know, they actually had the series i want to watch available for my country
as an european can confirm we have no souls
which funi wasn't
low bcs they wanted an international service
short term it's probably gonna be nice but long term it's gonna be a lot of question marks
not really a fan of it either way
https://www.sonypictures.com/corp/press_releases/2020/1209/atttosellcrunchyrolltosonysfunimationglobalgroup
or
read it on cr lol
no
technically sony did but ye
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
trash
ye
<:MariaTeehee:687455374911078412>
ye good times
remember 2012 where funi licensed symphogear?
ye
ye
shit as they are, they do know how to advertise
cr has physical ads all over america at times
well they didn't do enough
if amazon ever advertised it
strike would have been pretty good tbf
i could actually watch pripri on amazon, was one of the few
the block mha aired on before they moved it to daytime
animeism block also
discotek is
wouldn't know i dropped it past ep 3
esp bcs Mappa is also on it for s4
wits parent company is still on it which makes it even easier
they can just ask the production committee
lol they can though
kamikaze douga ops <:KEK:739953921895694417>
style in later seasons is better tbf
i like cute drawing styles
it looks cute at least
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
who does bandori designs so that makes sense aya
well the og designs are by craft egg
pls
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
why is strike witches actually good this season

~~never thought i would be able to live to see school days characters be turned into vtubers for xmas eve~~
<:KotoriBomb:275372642285125632>
<:yummy:235243310086750208>
nice
<:Bohemian:352427898944225281>
there's a whole bunch before 2009 also but phone isn't big enough to display all of it
a bit late but, easy to see where i actually got a job ~~and getting pickier what i wanted to watch~~
do it for r
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
rem, ram, retelgeus, rubaru, rmellia, relix, etc
whoever you want it to be hanabi
>apparently he's inspired by how the director used to be as a PA lmao
Now that doesn't even surprise me.
author gotta start part 4 now<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
it ended
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
him
yes
the brown one
the one that should die but keeps surviving guy
there's always ein or that other guy i keep forgetting his name of
she's one of the better ones at least in ibo
I'm still mad they never did anything mpre interesting with kudelia after s1 setting her up as jean darc type
just dont bother with the sunshine movie <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
recap <:pog:515960701484007453>
no other rings and bells on it
the committee is basically aniplex-shueisha-ufotable
they are
by crapton he means its just short of beating spirited away in terms of theatre sales <:15min:655058014495047690>
dun care about spin off girls
neither am i dw
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
in what order would you rank the entries btw
good plan
but it was good
like its just s2 rehashed
muse movie also has it's fair share of problems anyway
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
same usually
apparently you don't
it doesn't has any influence whatsowhever
in sunshine it's just whatever, it's there go fill time.
the traveling in the muse movie made sense
but yeah they could have put the final act of the movie in an ova and it would have been better.
it's not as bad as bandori fans
it's everything
doing stuff they shouldn't be doing and disturbing other fans
people ruined it for themselves so they had too be stricter
the anime just isnt the best part of the franchise
i love the girls
i spend over 10k dollars on LL dw
80% of the movie is just waste of screentime. The character antics are fun to watch but that's about it.
sometimes i just don't wanna bother watching an weekly show so i just rewatch one
managed to finish tsuki ga kirei again and half way on just because but that's about it iirc besides an ep
of gear here and there
i rewatch bcs i enjoyed them
i try to rewatch a few shows every year but didn't had that much time this year
but now according to my torrent list, removing not anime stuff. I'm behind a good 200 eps on shows im watching lmao
same, i watched all of slime in a day
it just happens with tama for me
me neither
i could watch all of tamayura in one go
<:aquacry:740233647293988905>
yukachi
tamayura makes me <:aquacry:740233647293988905>
but yeh give those 2 a whirl if you like sol
yes i do, i saw over 2000 of them <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<a:peeposmash:687087006634737689>
likes sol, hasn't watched the best ones
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
or tamayura
did you watch yama no susume yet
i don't know you anymore
<:JustFine:256624508025307137>
watching cute girls doing nothing after a day of work
i prefer iyashikei above regular sol but same
<:harold:364119409620418591>
twas full of fun animation and character acting which is already good
good show
yeh
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
s2 > movie > ss2 > s1 > ss1 > ss movie
just give us a SS season
<a:uziHyperSpray:585668641232519202>
I'm gonna go to bed <:MariaTeehee:687455374911078412>
i always fall behind
it makes sense why she does at least
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
sakamoto wears pants now
didnt it had that stupid as fuck moment with the meme faces last ep
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
they have like 2 now
just watch the idol performance and be done with it
<:obama:461648244049707012>
but hey hocchan showed up in the last 2 eps so
and for fruit tart, i've been enjoying it but sometimes it really get close to eh questionable content
thats for the bd
the cursed doll ep is my fav ep so far tho
the trude epo was one of my favs
yeah
new SW is unironically great
where im still on 7 eps watched or something
well half of it is from seasons ago
https://puu.sh/H01pm.png
lemme just screenshot my taiga
and for the rest eh
yeah
i've been enjoying it
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
https://puu.sh/H01oc.png
caught up with planes yesterday
yeah watching too much and behind on pretty much everything
actually talked about it a few days ago
<:15min:655058014495047690>
in the franchise
i love LL but the anime is like the worst entry
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
not niji
niji being better then the other seasons isnt that high a bar in the first place <:15min:655058014495047690>
and the inner thoughts stuff
bcs its all the monologues basically
this mini arc
the current arc is anime original
war game is really good
havent watched kizuna yet
tri isnt that good
no comment
did watch tri and am watching the new adventure one but its eh
i saw quite a bit of digimon but didnt really watch any of the more recent ones
for most people if you ever ask them for the best digimon season
its either 1) tamers 2) adventure or 1) adventure 2) tamers (or in the rare case both at the same spot)
universally so even
<@!87512939107450880> adventure is up there but the best one is Tamers
i might pick that up if i ever get time to catch up on the other shows
sometimes it is
i saw caps on twitter
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
kuma is getting a s2
clothing designs from people
not a show
all of their shows
<:15min:655058014495047690>
except this time they did it with a show that already had good clothing design and a dedicated fanbase that ratted them out
there's this thing about gohands plagiarizing clothing in every of their shows
and then now you have this delay
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
so people were pretty mad
but for babylon they just had to go against a fanbase with already perfectly fine designs by clamp
>jeez they could've at least been subtle about it

yeah and like they do have instances where they change it up a bit like in this case
https://puu.sh/H0DIR.png
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496650964384743434/791612159795789824/b99886e4.png
how didnt you hear of it yet
LH was supposed to air this season btw, it got delayed to january
his jail sentence was pardoned
he got a fine and house arrest
yes
house arrest ye
hey at least that one is supposed to be completely finished now
now imagine how it should have looked like bcs it was supposed to air this year <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
you is shafted in s2
if Nova is here i can go sleep
<a:peeposmash:687087006634737689>
it aint hard
ruby, riko, you, hanamaru, yo~~hane~~shiko, chika, dia, kanan and mari
they're doing the spinoff with miyuki as mc
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
not main storyline though
mahouka getting another anime
surprisingly enough ||no s2 announcement||
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
well i guess Sunrise finally had the chance to do this
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EqKwUIuVgAEgZ01?format=jpg&name=large
not that i would ever pick it up to watch it again.
it always struck me as a show that would be 24 eps.
and odin is a boring villain
it just doesn't have as much memery animation anymore to focus on dog fights
i still like the second half ofc
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
the first half is better then the second half <a:15min:490152487358300160>
regular pillowcases that is
and those are normal sized
regular ones from a high quality maker easily go above 70 bucks anyway
70 bucks isn't so bad
i want to see the salt and confusion
thats why i want the anime
i did
mostly so i could see all of the salt and confusion on the first few eps
<:cryingOtaku:754061720023990272>
why arent you giving us wa 2 s2
i love white album 1 and white album s2 and white album 2
;D
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
they showed glimpses of it but yeah lets just skip that volume
v8 is the raison d'être as in why miyuki and tatsuya act like this
bcs we are still criminally missing it in the main story for whatever reason
i only want the miyuki spinoff it it actually covers the past
instead of continueing the rest
im still laughing at it, that they're doing a spinoff anime for the 10th anniv of the series
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
sort of, its jsut the shit seen through miyuki's eyes
>dropped,||they killed off ~~baldie~~ the 3 stooges||
>Sigrdrifa, ah yes gungnir
so weird
😄
lmao
i hear it
time to go back
i skipped the op
least soundtrack is on point
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
wouldnt be the first time some show fumbles in the last stretch
like usual
probably late
and usually they are not planned like re:creators and sao
well recaps are there for a reason
thats one ep slot gone
well they did had to do a recap mid season
darlifra is awful past ep 15
Darlifa is actually eva light anyway
you dont like the gainax syndrome?
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
and inferno cop
nothing beats ninja slayer
nah <:15min:655058014495047690>
still doesnt beat luluco or ninja slayer though
KlK has the same issues every trigger series has but it was still one of their better shows
KxK in a nutshell
kill la kill is alright
you shouldnt look at others
instead of continuing something you dont like
then you should have
he wouldnt
but you know there's alsways 2 sides on a coin and this discussion is just one of them
same really
and actually fails at it
"the madoka ripoff"
everything about the series is awful
only good thing is the op
wasted potential
daybreak is meh
pitchi pitchi pitch? that mermaid one?
its just a weird take on it
utena is mahou shoujo
wait
lmao
stop smoking weed cypher
doremi is good
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
doremi
bcs thats how trigger rolls
~~and also chockfull of homages to eva~~
Gridman very good yeah
i dont hate the ending for that show but i do hate he went with the worst girl
oh one of those shows eh
i still love mayo chiki though even with the ending i hate
just filler
it wasnt even an ova
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
where they decided to make the final ep all filler
mayo chiki was it?
the worst ending is still eh fuck
im still gonna judge a show by its whole
the sequel actually explains it and makes it alright
i still think yuyuyu's ending is awful though
considering agk
i lowkey went into yuyuyu expecting more of a bloodbath
i'll just rewatch tutu if i want a dark take
and a 6 is just bad to meh
i gave it a 6
its not like i dropped genei or something
im not tired of it at all
yes hanabi
and i'm probably fed up by supbar mahou shoujo shows from the amount of mahou shoujo im watching
genei is just copy/pasted from aniplex thinking oh this formula worked
YuYuYu at least does its own thing
it doesn't really do anything to try and not be a clone
its easily one of the worst mahou shoujo takes i watched
its just not good
more like an easy 5 or maybe a 6/10
whatever the name was im having a brainfart
hopefully its as good as anohana and eggs movie
well got a group watch upcoming in a few minutes to watch Her blue sky so will cya around
;D
i should finish my jb rewatch tomorrow before i have to work again
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
giving kids to everyone
based game
thats eh you know who's kid
https://puu.sh/H18uY.png
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
yeah you had to find a joke item and it put you in the "lolicon"route
its just kuroneko's lil sister putting something udner her skirt and telling she made a baby with kyousuke but yeh
||https://puu.sh/H18sH.png||
the game has this cursed thing
cant hanabi
pretty sure they're on youtube with cgs if you just want to watch
<:15min:655058014495047690>
but yeah just play the game and get the other girls preggers
i just feel like its bcs inaho is an awful mc
in the game version they just let people decide who they wanted to end with
and they know
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
besides the fandom
and it wouldnt really have changed anything
the show could have picked any girl really
then glasses girl
the nkuro
ayase is best
kuroneko is like a solid second place
both wrong
wew
<:15min:655058014495047690>
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
we just disagree on not sol shows
we partly align
so dw \
my fav anime or still sol
<:15min:655058014495047690>
yeah i dont really go check other people's anilist or mal
but i probably should just do it
for rewatch
same
the regular movies (even if people cal lthem recaps) are better then the tv series also
liz is by miles the best entry in the series
the eupho spinoff yeah
Liz and the lbue bird
i would easily put maquia, liz and stuff above them
but at least he changed up his endings <:KEK:739953921895694417>
they both have their own share of different problems
i jsut really like both of them equally
i dont really prefer one or the other
and i suppose it did work out for him
your name is good yeah but its also shinkai trying to be more commercial
unless you're nagai who gives her more freedom
bcs that just doesnt work out
maquia just shows you should let okada do her thing (aka also direct) instead of trying to keep a lit on her.
yep
the whole cr anime thing is pretty meme
it wasnt indeed
i have the regular bd
and maquia only was in theaters the next year for the US
yeah bcs only US screenings counted <:KEK:739953921895694417>
that barely beats it
the only other one is like Liz
>it was okay

it was easily one of the best movies ive seen the past few years
anthem and anohana were good so i have hope for this third movie
from the nagai-oakda-tanaka trio
right found it Anthem of the Heart
rewatched it with the group like wednesday
yeah good movie
that takes place in the same town as anohana
the other one
not that one
<:blobKBYellow:622611791482060860>
group watch finally started
if its below i likely just dropped it
my ratings generally start from a 5 and go up till 9
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
fairly sure i liked recreators a lot i just can only remember the above xD
finished the movie (her blue sky) and twas pretty good
and some fun action
recreators has the best recap and some good eds and thats all i can really remember
half of the other shit is <:15min:655058014495047690>
then again not like Iok is the worst part of s2
it was really just grating and long overdue
they pulled the same shit like 4 or 5 times
its okay if you do it 2 times
and then when ||he dies|| finally it's just doesnt do anything
so i couldnt even hate him
except they didnt bcs he's an awful character
it ruined half of the show
it didnt
there was no reason to keep Iok alive past the first try
it was bad writing
and it wasn't even suffering
but for real i dont dislike s2 or think it's truly bad
its my spider sense
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
get over it cypher
ibo s2 is awful
MEN
~~i truly hate shin~~
<:stonk:688910872609161220>
at least seed destiny still has lacus doing something
wouldn't disagree on that one tho <:15min:655058014495047690>
like a lot of wasted potential
i just think s2 is wasted potential
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
like most of ibo so it fits
and then on others you just are like <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
some of them do what they're supposed to do
you can see them coming from 500miles beforehand
they're pretty telegraphed
carta was whatever tho
that actually got a reaction out of me
the only death done right in s2 is ||lafter||
it's just really weird framed by cr
it's mostly for the pixiv contest anyway
i generally don't mind but it just feels out of place most of the time in tart
<:harold:364119409620418591>
nobody cares about what panties they wear during concerts
it could do without all the not so needed ones tho
i wouldn't mind a s2 either but god tone down some of the unecessary fanservice.
ye
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
just think shield hero mc but a lot worse
still believing nasu will be free<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
the way they did it in s1 isn't gonna work at all for s2
I'm gonna look out for neverland next season just to see how they're gonna frame it
nice nice, gonna read it over the weekend then
they're still working with the other TM writers
nothing is gonna change on the scenario department
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
i still don't believe nasu is actually ever gonna be able to fully escape fgo
corona having thrown wrenches in schedules for everyone is just a real thing
fgo has been really slow this year and devs having to work from home doesn't help, gacha or not
lb 5.5 is a thing bcs of corona i tell you
nasu is never gonna be free
let me find my image
i was talking with friends this weekend on what we were gonna watch
that's next season also
yes cypher
atleast they already announced s3 for WT <a:15min:490152487358300160>
still wanted to see ga rei animatee but that's never happening
I'm behind on gou <:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
night
~~and they should do the live in 22~~
nah
if you're gonna stay in tokyo just use english <a:15min:490152487358300160>
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
yeah so no moka
they would have to finish sukasuka first and foremost
never
delayed
probably yeah unless well
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
oh found it, somewhat up to date but saw it's missing the hamster cgi turned into cars show
https://puu.sh/H1psJ.jpg
i want to clone myself so i can finish all these shows
y
<a:BonkCat:684146912298926101>
it works better bcs they went full instead of mixed imo
s2 looks better then s1 at least
https://tenor.com/view/magic-shia-labeouf-snl-skit-fingers-gif-4860090
agematsu works on both so maybe you're on to something <:Ver:704169051391524875>
sponsor rights probably expired
no but pizza hut doesn't exist in cg either anymore
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
you'll see it in s9
bandori is actually a spinoff from cg
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
which one
i even have it torrented
i still need to start s3
shouldn't be too hard to get used too
<:ADAM:450972428399673345>
the faces are drawn traditionally
depending on the show they have a secret for that
it still looks janky tbf
https://blog.sakugabooru.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/aikatsu-CG-02.jpg
it's in april
~~and then you have zls where the performances actually look bad~~
imas sideM also had good dance cgi
aikatsu is also pretty okay in later seasons, it just sort of stagnated and didnt really improve further
yeah
they do make it work on the performances unlike most other idol shows that go for cgi performances
he's not wrong at least
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
heck even Toei doesnt want to have anything to do with it anymore
appmon want that good to begin with anyway
apparently yes
it should be that
on the cat
look for [GOLDEN] Fate Grand Carnival New Year's Eve Special 2020 <@!274279989506211841>
on cat site
~~they're not gonna adapt everything in 16 eps so there's probably gonna be a final season part 2 or movie to finish it up~~
it was just for semi far shots so like ???
actually liked it, besides the janky cgi they used for basically ????
yep
could always give it a try <@!139432096023183360>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
its actually like a pseudo idol show
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
nah
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
oh like that
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
at least we got to see what symphogear people are working on now
unless its just bait and switch and silent week will take over for teio
s2 probably gonna grow on me but we had a full season that focused mainly on 2 girls and now we actually have to start from 0 again
well yeah its jsut a meh premiere really
can they jsut give us special week and suzuka antics back
<a:Reeee:731641517193560105>
>horsies s2
changed leads and she has an annoying voice
they saw how well kny movie did so maybe they'll try to bank on the same thing
it's anime btw
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
i too miss special week
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
dw you would be right

<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
should watch the movie op for 1/2 tho <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
so long to wait
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
https://puu.sh/H5ynS.png
looks at this pink notanzu
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
some of the original creators are from love live
~~shouldnt be a problem if you watch vtubers tho~~
granted you're probably gonna have to like full cgi motion tracking
which i also liked
only watched the short one named idolls! today
watching that tomorrow
idoly pride?
at least the song sounds good
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
live action director and staff that has not a single anime credit, what could go wrong.
well hiring people that work into anime might have helped in the first place
~~kumo's~~ yurucamp s2 probably gonna be the best one since antartica
~~also pretty sure the above text doesn't say February~~
fairly sure oppai loli is in s2
i still don't care about teio but fuck did it pull heartstrings
fuck the ep really
same
the trailer doesn't really tell you anything about the first ep.
just watch the ep
~~and some other super stupid stuff that fits serious discussion more~~
and they announced national emergency in over half of the country again
yeah
well they have too
on youtube
sorry about the 60fps but its the only good version
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gaLH5HtLoXs
let me jsut psot the vid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FKphvRlWXGM
think so ye

ye fenny, it's a meme
https://twitter.com/maidragon_anime/status/1349914397301383170?s=19
dragon maid 2 is in july
from the shit i watched
best first ep for this season though
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
that's pui pui molcar
but alas i have to confirm it is not the best show this season
🙂
i did yes
it was stupid
thats why they put him in anta iirc
bcs he's not a goody 2shoes protag
these are some pretty shitty nominees
i like s1, dun like s2 at all
~~they started inserting vtubers in the audience~~
1. the yama's
2. the yura's
3. the liz's
4. the yori's
5. the tsuki's

something like that probably
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
mines just whatever sol is good
4 good show<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
well its a bit different scenario
sure gives them enough time
before the anime airs
i should continue 86
and I'm also too lazy to make a schedule bcs i would never follow it
my tldr is i need to read shit but there's not enough hours in the day
monogatari is a novel <a:15min:490152487358300160>
I'm a stick dw
samz
the rest no idea
well i'll at least finish the ones on the watching list some time this year
the 2012 ones were on hold bcs i took a break from anime
god knows why lol
~~at least those are on my watching list still, there's 40+ that are on hold also~~
and im also behind on yamahime, precure, digimon, higurashi and stuff thats still ongoing
if everything its those and eh
nihon chinbotsu, major second, yesterday, 22/7, bang dream 3, eizouken, railgun T, aikatsu, chihayafuru, saranzanmai, kakegurui, fate/extra
so just from last season
adachi, gochuumon s3, haiykuu, kamisama, majo, sleepy princess
yes <:LUL:545650745534447631>
only from last season or we counting other shows that finished last year? <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
nah
~~and i still have to finish majority of last season lol~~
think im actually watching less then prev season
the signs have been there since the first ep but i still feel a don't show approach would have been better.
its heavy content you wouldnt really expect out of a so far cutesy show
is what i meant
its not something the show made up
that stuff happens in real life
same
in  the flashback ||you see her in a gravure shoot in a room full of photographers taking pics while she's taking off her top||
||pedo stuff||
<:harold:595434251286085653>
i wanted to watch a cutesy show about mixing stage play and idols and it has been doing that and then they hit you with stuff that happens irl
feel like it should have stayed hinted at, you couldn't really miss the implications last week with how they were framing it.
gekidol 3, well they heavily hinted at it last weeks ep about airi's backstory but didn't think they would actually show it as a flashback to open this weeks ep.
||https://puu.sh/H96yv.png||
TNP sounds like its gonna be fun next ep<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
lol
everything is butchered in the show so you might as well watch the fights on yt
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
the only way to watch the show is through a youtube compilation
toei is gonna toei
hugging
I'm still halfway through goldy pond mangawise so not sure
minerva?
ep 2 was ch||45||
ep 3 is like ch||98||
so hopefully they still go back to that
goldy pond was like the only good arc left
the manga was ass anyway
it's the writer writing it so thats not what im too worried about
they already said they're gonna do original content
i just didn't type it
T is for The
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
promosing neverland
tnp ep3 ||looks like they're skipping goldy pond arc||
<:obama:461648244049707012>
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
this year
ofc
having faith in sunrise in 2021 <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:782815928961335316>
idols
<:harold:364119409620418591>
loris even capsed the D
cypher....
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
that one was pretty meh yeah
and he's already on the lowest of the low list
issei is a pervert and a much better mc
i sure as hell aint gonna watch something with an mc as dipshit like that
the anime
it only looks good
yes
and the mc is also an absolute dipshit <:15min:655058014495047690>
which makes like no sense bcs shit like log horizon came out 2 years before tensei even started
the one that confuses me the most is tensei tbf, at least the talk about it hailing it as the setter of isekai and such
<:stonk:688910872609161220>
best isekai?
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/dogdays/images/e/ee/Biscotti.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/636?cb=20110420161831
<:15min:655058014495047690>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
we have been over this cypher
its not
^
<:15min:655058014495047690>
but gigguk is trash
doesnt change the fatc that it's watching an anituber
>spending time to watch an anituber
the problem here is
i dont hate it but idk if i would watch s2 and s3 though
im strictly speaking bout the anime, didnt read the wn/ln for that
death march was also disappointment
yeah they can control it
no idea
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
yeah gems wanted to be like ex-arm but failed at the aesthetic
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
people just dont understand just yet how good it truly is
and at that point anime will be saved
all anime should aim to be like ex-arm
its visionary
ex-arm is the anime we needed
it very much is real
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496650964384743434/802985355267538995/1611512726658.webm
||they haven't animated them going out either||
dun think so
i just want to see that one part animated
i've been reading it
s3 when shaft
nor is anyone giving him 20+ eps to work with
and yet still he keeps doing the same thing
in any of his original works he just doesn't have the time
except in vns it works bcs of the pacing
he writes his works with hours and hours of content no matter if its a vn or original work
he's never been good at anime
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
~~the only thing you ever did right~~
thanks cr
the first step on the ice is better
hifumin best girl btw
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
but now enough tamayura or I'm gonna spend my time rewatching that instead of actually watching seasonals
the guy who directed aria created tamayura
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
tamayura best iyashikei
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
if you ignore ex-arm at least
it totally is
i would never disagree with someone calling keijo best anime ever
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
tamayura
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
the real problem is that neither of you folks have the actual best sol on that list
you can still split up sols
that's the thing
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
nothing happens
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
yes that's the definition of sol
but yeah i hope they actually change it up, else they're gonna get me again like on ep 2.
<:ADAM:450972428399673345>
do you want me to spoiler it?
at least next ep is gonna be depressing as hell if they're gonna keep following the outcomes of races according to the real life versions
granted every ep of s2 has sympho crew on it now but this ep was full sympho crew
don't let anyone tell you this ep was made by symphogear crew
why would you make a tomoyo after anime that's ||more depressing then clannad and has not a single happy end||
no
instead of letting him write scripts for anime
and then adapt those vns with good staff
just let him write vns
<:harold:364119409620418591>
assuming he shows up again
KEY president said their newest vn is also getting an anime™️ and want to do more original anime so there's always that maeda chance.
it's by no means bad though, probably has the better ending tho
it's the whole story in like an hour and a half?
movie yes
air also exists tbf
toeis clannad isn't like bad but its not like good either
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
and i was referring to toeis kanon and clannad
the second season adapting the true route is what saved the show
lb was a mess
the other versions less
the kyoani ones work
depends on the entry <a:15min:490152487358300160>
~~people seeing things in things that aren't really things~~
<:obama:461648244049707012>
<:harold:364119409620418591>
now watch todays wep ep
and now go back to the fluffy side pls gekidol
yeah
i had to know
yes
<:harold:364119409620418591>
dbz might be bigger but fma was just his more popular role. you just see more fma then dbz when he signs stuff etc
tho pettanko song was good!
yes
looks like she did yeah
yes
they already tend to handle intl licensing so that might be enough for them to take the loss in revenue
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
director begging the tv-stations?
rezero also uses runtime they would normally use for adbreaks
about that
its not
yes but no bcs it's actually a loss in revenue <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
meanwhile me, how do they keep getting away with all of these  extended runtimes
<:ShiitakeKB:589969967777185792>
idols shows are the best
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
Fairouz
the zeno's would have found healing boring so that would be removed
they would have put restrictions on his shit anyway
it would have gotten rid of the weak ones but people like toppo, hit, etc are more then buu can handle
he doesn't even have enough space for all of them on the first place
buu
not likely bam
and probably buu also
super is just one big fuck you to gohan
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
at least gohan was still relevant in Z
or whatever the content is in them
they're still well constructed panels whether you like them or not
goku just never changes
but he doesn't?
and even if the story is ass, toriyama knows how to construct fights
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
so like every other shounen where friendship is magic instead db kills everyone and then revives them
this is just pointless anyway
krillin also uses kamehameha so did he also "steal" it from roshi?
it doesn't really matter if something is original
you pass on your techniques
and exactly how martial arts work
that are just learned abilities anyway
king kai
already said stolen is a bad word choice
everyone could it if they learned it from those aliens
not stolen
that's something he learned
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
that would be stolen according to bamce
stolen is a bad word anyway
goku knows that technique
roshi has some of the best fight scenes in super
and the weaker here, the stronger there
so the stronger you are here the weaker there
they could actually make them relevant by doing a world shenigans were powers get reversed
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
super 2 when
db without a series gives toei more money then one piece they're actively producing so like
<:harold:364119409620418591>
are they gonna give us super 2 this year though
it's way better then all of super
at least the dbsuper: broly movie was fun to watch
he wouldn't
falling asleep was just a lazy way to write him out
and buu having trained super hard and be looking slim so i doubt he would have turned them into choco in the first place.
so was the enemy
just like how they werent allowed to use senzu beans
<http://i.imgur.com/InWo2.jpg>
you should see his family tree
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
both best dad and worst dad goes to Tomaru Sawagoe
oh def
he's a better parent then people let him out to be?
thanks for proving how martial arts work
and shit like kao finish feet kame, IT kame are still his own or techniques he created based on techniques he learned from other people.
bcs it is
and we proved you wrong
yeah
and using a technique and changing it is generally also labeled as an original technique to begin with
it's a skill he invented
which doesn't matter?
and this
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
good try though
and meteor combo and dragon fist are inventions by goku
techniques get passed on all the time
same
amazing
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
symphogear x transformers
i would whale for that
star driver was better then captain earth btw awesomedude
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
y
nah Boulé
~~hopefully they changed the other thing~~
horsies ep 5, well the race outcome didnt change but then the ep ended
also to go back a lil bit, how's kiss even doing rn after google patched the exploit they we're using
the industry standard is still low and crap no matter who you work for
and amimaru also got into fire for paying 1 dolalr a page for letterer
who pays 120 yen per page for tl (medibang handles manga plus manga's generally)
i sure hope it isnt based on the medibang industry rates then
bcs the standard is still under paid
yeah but the amount
which standard lol
so you get worst of both worlds
and pop up ads
but the thing is that nsfw ads pay the most
they eh don't really want too
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
at least i remember this dialogue from this play bcs its the same as ep 0
lol i went from wonderegg into 2 eps of gekidol
fried for today
sounds like it yeah
seria quite literally broken lol
i should have watched yurucamp after this, not before
i might be too dumb for this show
and then the following ep is even more ????
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
and nothing makes sense
this series did so many things idk man, stage playingm then idols, you have the stuff in ep 3, then next ep goes from practice to the creep looking at camera's to see the girls, to a kissing scene to some weird outer world explosion flashback to seira seeing the doll as alice
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
ok i see what you meant now. Realized at the end it was yamauchi directing this ep and then it made sense <:LUL:545650745534447631> 
and wtf is this show.
but sounds like fun
i haven't watched it yet
oh hey it's rie
when she started talking i was like instantly
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
rie joined rezero, anime is saved
i dont bcs sometimes i like to rewatch something <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
i delete seasonal stuff after i finished the whole show
its what i use to auto torrent my stuff
its nice
yeah ive been using it the past 2 years
sawano and yamamoto ye
https://twitter.com/anime_eightysix/status/1357645747810836481
btw cypher, they just dropped pv for this
yeah
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
you misspelled the 3 stooges cypher
just not as good as it could have been
yeah
~~it needed more time in the last half~~
so now they're gonna wrap up everything this season by skipping and going original.
like honestly if they didn't already announced s2 publicly they would have just axed it.
likely bcs the manga tanked hard in the end and the committee didn't want to spend another 4 seasons to wrap up the story.
actually yes
kumo looks worse tbf
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
gonna quote this also
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
reminds me i need to catch up with nnb s3
for sols it def is
<:15min:655058014495047690>
and skate
and wep
pretty sure molcar is better
<:15min:655058014495047690>
also > MAL
Mushoku isnt even good so will it really even get to mal's "top 20"
the saddest thing is that they paid a lot of money for those experts and then they waste all of it and not actually doing anything with it
well its about her so yes
well the prequel ln would help to care about the old garde
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
and its the boobs ep isnt it
sw has the second best episode of lat year yeah
so yes they should have done goofy stuff
the goofy eps are better then all the rest
~~show would have been better if it dropped the serious tone and went goofy all the way~~
i just put it in "isekai"bcs it really should just be tagged as fantasy
yes nova that's my point
<:15min:655058014495047690>
familiar of zero is a better "isekai" then MT
~~its just like how we use mecha in the west and japan uses mecha~~
it's all just fantasy in the end
same for inuyasha
people count it as isekai usually
japan still mostly lists them as fantasy bcs after all isekai is merely a subgenre of that
the term only got coined  around that time
isekai wasnt even a thing pre 2010s
so the naoru and the like websites
they're counting the web novel boom
they're not counting those
different concepts but still isekai
and log horizon
rezero and shit is older
its not
which is lol
people also still think it was one of the first isekai
so
the fucking author even admitted he's always gonna be a pervert
^
i said he's unbreaable to watch rn
that's not what i said though?
is very nice
char development where he still stays a pervert
on that regard
and the animation isnt gonna save the show
and so is his dad
i can't even enjoy mushoku bcs rudy is such a shit
they had the choice to not pick it up <:15min:655058014495047690>
s4s problem is actually what most cgi shows have problems with and its not having good composite
for s3
well colosall ye but the rest not really
so good thing he didn't act on it
him thinking about it is already fucked up
there's also a clear difference between a slap and grooming
what has he not done?
and if you do there's a high chance you would actually go to jail
he's right though we're all perverts but still none of us are gonna do what rudy does
he doesn't
but you aren't
im not watching ||child porn like rudy before his reincarnation||
it can invent memes all it want, it doesnt gonna make it good
yeah meme's aren't important anyway <:15min:655058014495047690>
others just also copies mt
mnushoku took those tropes though
but good try
most of those tropes come from western novels from the 80s
5 still gave me more of wuuuuuut
~~nvm gekidol exists~~
i'm just gonna go watch more idol shows, at least they're happy
yeah
it could be more then one thing
the teacher is a red herring
i know about the roxy stuff and its awful yes
see stupid reason + the wheeze emoji again
there's no logical reason for that but go ahead
on point
lmao
https://puu.sh/HdZl9.png
<:Nani:460465184885178368>
^
<:harold:595434251286085653>
yeah bcs age matters
clearly not enough
then you should watch and read more stuff
MT does have it
but konosuba does have it
you keep throwing character development around as a big word
he isn't
he's really not
i'm a perv (lol) and i cant even relate myself with rudy
he's not relatable
all you do when we say something is blabla and a wheeze emoji
nova at least does make better points
we get the point better then you phanta
he would be a shitty human to a shitty human
~~i feel like you could bait a lot of people in this server by saying there's a kiss between girls~~
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
lmao
why did i get AK to continue watching it again
eat egg
it's all shit bcs it means still no more new game
maeda <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
this is gekidol after all, nothing is what it seems
watch it be a third party
||i wonder if doll did suicide at the end or if it was the other girl who's name i forgot threw her off the roof||
well they're not really human like
<:harold:595434251286085653>
next they're gonna reveal one is a clone of the other
~~as long as aria and seria get a good end together~~
until the second half hit
at least it was a fairly normal first half
||the dango daikazoku scene in after story||
after story itself is the major heavy hitter
s1 still tends to go more for the comedy
well yes honestly
yeh
that said part 2 is in fall
it just came out so might be a while
it's still sad but it also has a lot of time for comedy
<:15min:655058014495047690>
i can't
the "best"db torrent is like 900+gb lmao
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i was gonna grab more movies but >no space
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
||mono audio isn't worth it||
the actual video files are small but its all of the bazzillion audio included that gives it such a huge filesize
same
<:harold:364119409620418591>
nnb is actually ending mangawise
at least it can get more content
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
but banana did so much work
maya still my fav tho
it's 7 am and i need to sleep, pardon my mistakes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
yeah
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
such a good statement
i remember using I am Tendou Maya as twitter handle during revue airing
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
and he personally storyboarded and directed ep 8 of starlight
ppst starlights action director is Kouta who's non other then symphogears main action director.
ofc i don't think he actually makes them super detailed like in concept art
lego racecars exist so it doesn't seem that hard
i don't know of a single design he did without trying to build it in lego first tbf
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
lego first concept second
he probably has modified ones, but he still does it like that either way
his concept art is drawn after his lego builds so if it doesn't work out in the lego to transform then it will be reflected in the concept art
he does that before concept art
i mean yeah? but he builds everything in lego so he can try to see it with that
he probably did and saw it just didn't work
with his legos?
bet he tried anyway
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
<:ADAM:450972428399673345>
and yes they transform
and its done by kawamori
there's this movie based on a gacha satelight did that have robot turtles
it's not a kawamori design if the mecha dont transform
that's bcs kawamori is a nut and builds them in real life with legos and see if they can transform

delayed bcs of the earthquake
shits actually dating early on instead of going in circles for a billion novels is <:JustFine:597629265147723777>
can't wait to watch it tonight
<:harold:364119409620418591>
even that generic synopsis already reads better then his other work lol
yes
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
they must be content with redo's anime to greenlit his other isekai for anime
i haven't actually watched the real ed yet
ye funi has a different ed
sounds like a great ep
sounds like fandoms alright
AL still was better then KC anime
the shorts were fairly amusing
full fledged version at least
and yes amiya
they're producing the show
warner bros has been involved since anime for like 20 years
just do my own thing
i just don't care about fandoms
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
ro and m16
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
ro
<:RoThink:735510385964351550>
i just want to see ro animated
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
also the source having a "good" story doesn't mean the anime will
they've only been trying to give it a proper story the last few worlds but that's not something the anime would reach
the game has like no story in the first place
which is actually not a bad reason?
and AL was just fanservice for players
the name is new, the people aren't
tensho only wanted to make his own studio
they're all people who worked on anime for years
maybe
will probably watch the gfl anime tho
~~i think they were credited on last aot ep or the ep before~~
yostar has there own animation studio so if they ever want to tackle non shorts ak would be an option though
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
they'll make ganyu flat
hopefully never
just wait
ak will get one
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
china money
just like shinkai, hosoda repeats everything
not that it's a bad thing ofc
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
and this trailer has the same climax in it as sw
war game is pretty different then his other family movies
yes
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
summer wars version 3
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
lol ruby
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
that's something you have problems with
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
but yeah not gonna go in with high expectations, at least that way i can be surprised
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
it just depends if you follow japans way of what anime is or the west
it is but people are really hung up about what anime is and what cartoon is lol
I'm also on the other camp but its just what it is
yeah chaos but the west still classifies it differently
the folks who worked on avatar
it's done by studio mir iirc
yes
it's agematsu so
just gonna be another boys band anime
<:wakarimasu:476452770682241062>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i only praise aoi
afraid so
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
and anno is already intentionally delaying it to golden week
esp not with corona
3.33 is his highest grossing movie anyway but idk if 3+1 will beat it
<:15min:655058014495047690>
well Paris
i'm more interested in 3+1 tbh
<:15min:655058014495047690>
it was perfect anno drama
the one that's completely new
or maybe they will actually chill now
we're close to getting in the final stretch so i'm just expecting it to get worse then it is rn
but i dont trust this show
i wish the same
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
i think we as viewers are suffering more then the girls in the show
<:harold:595434251286085653>
the show isnt worth it
dont take the bait
instead of just baiting around it
well they are actually gay in anime for once
all bait
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748> i like akb
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
soft and soothing
chisato has a really nice voice
she looks (and probably is) gonna be the meme
yeah
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
her name is keke but she says kuku
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCT9qseWRgI&feature=youtu.be
her valentine message killed me
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
except for dess she says kuku in the middle of her lines
koko is as bad as kirika
<a:pepegashoot:695457128592179330>
2 same cds. but 1 different song and cover
<:Hinatuuuh:811553016477122560>
gotta buy 2 cds even
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
followed straight by superstar in july
they're first reairing niji in april on it
they show a lot of anime but >idols
it's their(of nhk) educational channel
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
I'm just laughing that its on nhk-e
jebaited by prev ll leads you were
<:teedus:774534056594767882>
<:aquacry:740233647293988905>
like poor ruby
least there's no grating voice on it
keke and chisato are my favs
they fit
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
anyway, the credits have people on it who died in the fire
bcs they are
why would you do this loris
the promo vid for dragon maid s2 hurts
was the preview last week big bait or not
i saw same visuals so i skipped
nice
oh new song
i would like more teekyu but guy is working on other sometimes meh shows
also the show if you want to hear hanakana singing about panties
pte is peak memes but teekyu is the acid
it's just not as bad as teekyu
well it is
it's an acid trip
we have the better show today anyway
dw mt will have copied that so twill be the same tropes <:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
time to cleanse my tastebuds with an ep of nnb
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so the funi version ed
guess thats another one i'll have to watch
:^)
i guess a barbie doll was too much for funi
finally looked at the real ending aniamtion also
i feel like we get baited every time
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
they're gonna pull the better trigger
when are you saying it's aliens
so gekidol
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
wep was good yorokobe shounen
<:harold:595434251286085653>
i watched wep before gekidol
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
one day
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
nvm
watching gekidol, me: man this looks like a pretty normal ep
we get past first half of the ep again
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
never gonna get a sequel
keijo anime is so tame
and bears
and swords
but yes
boobs and ass
<a:MeltDance:768807501617168416>
keijo disagrees
might as well watch trashy ecchi tbh
tis discotek after all
sounds normal
yah
if you liked the anime try out the manga really
it taking itself so serious is the best thing about it tbh
i miss keijo
there's like || an asstronaut, asscalibur, russian riding a bear|| and more
yes?
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
aliens
the official twitter has been teasing a sequel
https://twitter.com/maohgakuin/status/1364571839029153798?s=19
not joking carlos
~~which also teased a s2 earlier today~~
misfits :^)
akeno
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
<a:dessdaba:586129381831868424>
still havent seen the movie
<:15min:655058014495047690>
i stil lthink haifuri should be more haifuri and less mind controlled vermin
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
yeah the op where everyone mishears waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaanker
the tv show itself was ergh
the movie is pretty good tbh
kantai collection and azur lane
<:15min:655058014495047690>
gup better then both tho
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
honestly you could just say any used a lot in anime name and it's probably in the show
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
did he give any actual reasons?
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
https://twitter.com/Bloodyredstar/status/1365134725392850944
https://twitter.com/wep_anime/status/1365270650105995271
it's recap time
also wep ep is delayed
new release date
shinkalion is getting a sequel iirc
peak anime
10mins of nothing
the opening of liz is still the best
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
ye she
<a:MeltDance:768807501617168416>
so it gives kyoani more to animate
author keeps writing more bcs he likes the anime
i like it
more gay then hibike main
gay
pop team epic
lol
they'll do it both
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
the rest is like 9s at most
the only 10/10 anime is pte and maybe teekyu
it's not like kyoani ever follows the source lmao
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
just watch it
<:RubyCry:356677866957570048>
why would you post something so terrible like that
and its now time to put my youtube history full of marching bands again
<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
first ep was extremely good faces
she became like this after
it was better before the events of this flashback arc
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
at least miyuki's reasons for why she's like this will be adapted
>s1
>filler movie that takes place after v17
>s2 that takes place before the filler movie
>v8 ova/movie that takes place between s1 and s2
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
this isnt monogatari where it works
what is adapting in chronological order
about time actually
im just lazy ok
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so unless you know jp and the meaning of it you're gonna miss out some stupid jokes
<:harold:595434251286085653>
and they're not tld in the cr version
the monster of the week have a particular name that they make a running gag
would still use the fansubs anyway
ofc
i had to try recalling if they said their names before
and show the villain his master plan
yah
actually disappointed in how normal it was <:LUL:545650745534447631>
its actually fairly normal so far?
it is time
Kon keeps getting cursed projects lol
<:Hinatuuuh:811553016477122560>
which was also the same like that
same producer as backstreet girls
can't make this up
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/448260634161840133/816145555695992832/image0.png
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
which is already miles better
ex-arm at least moves
why even bother animating it then
>let's make it anime
>shot per shot is just a manga panel
>barely anything is animated
it looks so bad
<:harold:364119409620418591>
<a:MeltDance:768807501617168416>
they actually have been acting on stage for 9 eps now
everything is just a stage play
gekidol is gekidol
<:Nani:460465184885178368>
let's not think about it, iski
its recap
finally a villain i can get behind <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
i would actually root for the villain if it means we all get mind controlled but see cute girls doing cute things.
but hey you know
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
no joke
https://puu.sh/HlvoA.png
<:harold:595434251286085653>
in the OP there's a shot that makes her look like homura
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
with all problems that come attached
95% of the time they're unplanned and actually eat up episode slots so you have 1 (or more) less eps to tell your story
recaps are a plague
even recreators who added intentional and planned recaps used the. 5 numbering iirc
it being numbered 8 and not. 5 like usual still strikes me as very odd
and in worst case it's actually just 11 eps
which would also suck
tv time slots are the issue
nobody knows
or rotoscoped reference like kaguya ed
might have been used as a reference
it's a lot of cuts so tad more expensive then low cuts
it's far from cost saving
it's not just about the walk cycle, it's high detailed hair and clothing movement that's solo key animated
honestly i might disagree the ed is a cost saving measure? it has way more details to animation then what you would usually see in eds or shows in general.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
bottom right
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
i wonder
looks at cover
hence my they might actually have to rotate for the last few eps and maybe outsource really quickly to even more studio's who might be able to help a hand on short notice
and weps own ap basically said the whole thing is beyond crashed lol
though granted the last few eps of wep actually did had more ka on it that werent on show before so they might actually have to set rotations for the last few eps if they want to survive.
probably more of the same people then wep
team with the same people every ep
skate is also having the same problems
every ep has basically the same people instead of rotating teams (bar episode directors and such and even then they generally still work on other eps as a ka) and while in theory this is how anime should be made it just runs into roadblocks in the current landscape.
wep is mainly bcs of their circumstances tbf
so does wep
bcs making anime sucks and virtually every anime has production issues
so i can marathon the whole thing after it ends
finally
there's quite a bit of info you can put together from this ep tbf
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
~~mal sucks news at 11~~
heh
don't worry they announced a new demon lord anime also today.
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
i just think parttimer s2 is cursed when the cast for it has been getting together every year since s1 for drinks and they didn't even know about s2 happening. it came as a surprise for them also.
>people hyped about mao s2
>me, fuck yeah misfits s2 is 24 eps
they're like 20 years behind france
<:15min:655058014495047690>
>expecting US to actually release good manga
you cursed it now
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
~~for real though, it's probably gonna be something dumb but idk what else they would even do for umineko but a remake~~
~~so i guess it might be anime~~
granted 07 also said it's just a guest appearance for him and not related to anime but he still wants anime
<:15min:655058014495047690>
umineko announcement in some way monday
hey bern want to know something funny
the 3dcgi
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
or more shirobako
or more plane girls
<:hinatahappy:813070375725301819>
which is the better show
and why work on gundam 00 when he can do more girls und panzer
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
it's okay the director for 00 is too busy with other stuff so it never gonna come out
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i should probably rewatch fafner before tackling the last part tho
i much prefer fafner above any gundam
they release like 2 eps a year
waiting on the last part to be fully released to watch it
yes
or he could write another meme show like mayoiga
the dog fights are amazing
<:Hinatuuuh:811553016477122560>
see second reply
kotobuki
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
~~if the actual shit would have been a sgood as the armor it would have been a good show~~
ln is probably better then the anime
thats ichika's power
it's not a harem op mc demon lord mecha battle school anime
you know the problem IS has
~~or have the option disabled s oyou see every spoiler anyway~~
imagine not clicking black bars
bcs it was aoi voicing the mc
<:harold:595434251286085653>
that should have been last years precure
suffering never ends
same
what is time
the real big brains is giving the anime to KAI and outsourcing some eps to PA Works
<:15min:655058014495047690>
can't sing when there's suffering every ep
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
this ep also had gear someone co directing who worked on gear and script
script writer was also gear
Ono did ep 5 or 6 for directing
not kaneko tho <:LUL:545650745534447631>
dpending on the ep that is
yes
it's practically symphogear
i was referencing the staff <:LUL:545650745534447631>
~~just blame symphogear~~
but why must every ep hurt so much
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
one which doesnt really do anything and the others are zombies lol
<:15min:655058014495047690>
in neither of those they break bones so they can't dance though
would have watched if it was an adaptation, spinoff is zzzzz
<:hinatahappy:813070375725301819>
more anime to skip
> The original series depicted the story of protagonist Rean Schwarzer and his companions throughout four titles set in the giant military nation of Erebonia, but the anime series will depict a story based on the original and set in the western part of the Zemurian continent.

that reads like a spin-off
the singles yes, the box set is new and they might be taken that as time frame
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVv3kouh4is
eggidol
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
that's part of the course
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
i can imagine
i should catch up though I'm so behind on the show
their schedule for april lists more Gou
assuming atx didn't do a big dumb at least
Gou isn't ending <:ADAM:450972428399673345>
gekidol: 🤯
it would actually look a bit different if i update it
if i actually remembered the pass to my mal account i would have posted my old top10 pic <:ADAM:450972428399673345>
but i trust in 07
I'm not far enough to make a judgement about the later stuff
both it seems
do you like Gou?
fandom is so split about gou it's funny
yup
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
free does have a cute girl
i mean
I havent even finished eizoken yet <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:BikkiWink:687463732284358696>
oh lanks you know it
by default
so its trash
bcs every anime is trash
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
i just answered, not like i saw the show
<:15min:655058014495047690>
actual trash
<:elatedwing:772570942311235585>
comfycamp
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
nice
and as far as Utsumi shows goes, banana fish and sk8 are gayer
S1 has the most of it bcs of utsumi directing, other seasons still have it but less
Free is mostly tame
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
readhead went from 10cm braids to 2mm braids
art is kinda ruined
s2 that is
it looks trash tho
well studio's are busy and its been ages
like the devil is a part timer?
this season is still set up for future events that may or may not even get adapted lol
that didnt help yeah but i still sort of agree with solopy lol
and they did drag the flashback eps a bit
in grand scheme of things it's important but not so much is happening unlike in s1
i can sort of see that
memory snow is important still
bcs this was the second half of it lol
<:15min:655058014495047690>
she has enough background if you watched memory snow
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9Z4hyx6NYTw
❤️
thats the good part about the show
<:15min:655058014495047690>
liz is better then any of those anyway
still good enough for me to buy the bds
drags on too much at times and they made ||the date a slideshow||
pancreas is alright
as the moon, so beautiful, loris
either that or just because
romcom wise, probably same
~~i totally didnt visit the place when i went to japan~~
good anime
>tamayura movies are the best but from like 2018-2020
liz >maquia>tenki/name
gonna download these 2 eps after work lmao
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
I'll take that as a no but instead they double downed on the weird shit
only to add >rev to the final ep
lol the guy deleted the torrent and reuploaded it
do they atleast wrap up their mess?
just bd box in middle of airing lmao
i looked it up and sure is, so fucking weird
just skip every ep where someone dies
what
pico is at least good <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
good
editing is the bane on both official and fan tls <:teedus:774534056594767882>
meanwhile me reading more trashy isekai (and i actually like it lmao)
<:Hinatuuuh:811553016477122560>
<:sparklewink:813068720230105119>
it's not hard, you just need a dictionary or 2 with you and a pen and paper to write on<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
cute
citr
i won't understand half of it but still worth it
granted they're just named sunrise #number
things would be so much easier if they credited every studio properly instead of using collective name sunrise
having 9 studio's probably help <:ADAM:450972428399673345>
>how
>bandai wanting more non mecha
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
looks at xenoglossia
why not both
~~thats's basically my list already~~
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
how do you even rate it
still gonna watch the subbed eps though but like i have no idea how im even gonna rate this show
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
just like every other ep in the show
<@!139432096023183360> my brain might be fried
<:nani:241228065357824001>
>starts ep 12
and now we have the ||symphogear useless secret agents||
gekidol 11 so that's ||why she was limping lmao||
depends on the injury tbf
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
twin turbo is shit but she has fun design
and gyaru horse
same
she grew on me at least
<:hinatahappy:813070375725301819>
but mcqueen is besto anyway
same, its just not the same without ||spe and suzu as leads though||
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
it's more heart wrenching tho
got comfycamp going also
it will probably pick up in a bit
btw <@!139432096023183360> might be a while for these last 2 eps https://puu.sh/Hojiv.png
guy forgot he was seeding and shut down his pc
good
lmao
studio 1 (mostly gundam (mostly tomino)
studio 2 (some gundam, also bebop etc, people left from this to make bones)
studio 3 (newest gundam series like build fighters, age, ibo)
studio 4 (code geass, mostly assists studio 2 nowadays)
studio 5 (kids shows, should be defunct now, they made BNP for kids shows)
studio 6 (whatever they can work on)
studio 7 (sister studio's are 9-10), (seed and seed destiny, whatever they can work on)
Studio 8  (sister studio is 11),  xenoglossia, love live, horizon, accel world and stuff
D.I.D (their in-house CGI studio)
Nerima studio(more random stuff like valvrage and cross ange)
Sunrise Origin studio (in-betweening only)
Sunrise Beyond (old xebec but without the IPs)
^Iski
well it is the old to go to spot
it's different when your whole game is akiba <:ADAM:450972428399673345>
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
considering LL is akiba and akibas trip is akiba
wouldn't it make more sense for ot to be akibas trip then
at least anime wise, no clue about merch and kits
~~seed still beats 00~~
<:ADAM:450972428399673345>
you know >||aliens||
but yeh not that keen on trailblazer movie
it's eh a thing al right
the edit lmao
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
just go to japan and they are
also netflix so might be a while
no idea loris
and it doesn't really surprise me tbh, seed moved animewise like 60k+ bds iirc and that was before bonuses/special events were the thing to buy bds for lol.
seed and destiny confirmed better <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
delta is in that weird spot where they have a char who is ||a straight descendant from older macross|| and also the whole plotline about the music box
macross in general
also pretty good
its same and yet different
starlight revue stage plays <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
might as well just buy it straight from the company itself then

<:LUL:545650745534447631>
they do
amazon calculates it in the shipping price
you do though
gsc is always a flat 2k jpy shipping
just buy it on gcs lol
sounds even worse then bpost over here
now with covid and a lot of shipping things not working i have no idea
gsc doesnt charge you until like 2-3 weeks before shipping iirc
F
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
esp in current year
so i can pay online
mostly why I'll just dhl or fedex it
bpost is a scam
<:AsahiClown:596537333419868170>
only way to pay here is cash and the exact amount
<:teedus:774534056594767882>
still gotta pay for paperwork bcs it's 2021 and we still don't have a digital infrastructure
<:Hinatuuuh:811553016477122560>
wdym you don't like seeing 7 euro import tax 20 euro paper work 26 euro handling fee
genius system
so with shipping alone you'll be above that cap
and its like max cap of 25 euro for no import tax lol
they're now ruled the same as regular import
people marked everything as gift to bypass import tax
gifts don't work here anymore
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
and services charge extra
well, you might still get hit by the import tax either way when buying from jp
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
exclusive bonuses are so scammy though
and as I say that i look at the FAG books that had some extra shit included for buying on koto website
amazon doesn't get the exclusive bonuses <a:15min:490152487358300160>
they just don't have as much available as on the jp store
koto ships intl on their us website btw
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
no matter if its in separate months
you don't pay for additional shipping
just bulk buy on gsc
but yeh uk is listed under countries gsc ships too
<:teedus:774534056594767882>
<:KotoriBomb:275372642285125632>
but poor mangaka tho
god knows solo
(it's about the sequel manga, the og ended in '19)
im just gonna wait till they can actually air the full ep
should be fairly interesting how they tackle it with a new team though
at one point they will run out tho <:LUL:545650745534447631>
there's still quite a bit they could do if they wanted too
there's still side stories
the main story is
good thing it's not <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
nice time for ||aliens||
same i guess
heh
ye cr, funi on vrv covered like most but we can't have nice things
still too much streaming services tho
and ellation was owned by A&T
ellation was cr owner before funi
well cr doesn't own vrv, ellation does and im not sure vrv was actually included in the deal tbf
https://twitter.com/comic_natalie/status/1371667562669371395?s=19
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
it wasn't a downer for once at least
next season is where i watch this season <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
if you count yesterdays ep then yeah 2
well sunday was interrupted so not counting
3
yeah
people are sadists
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
they actually community voted for the poor guy to "review" it
like im not even gonna disagree with Nox's his take after this ep. I do really just start feeling that way.
https://twitter.com/SpiritusNox15/status/1371879357921255432?s=20
for shock factor
i sort of have the same problem with wep the past few eps tbf, it just keeps adding stuff for the sake of it that aren't really needed
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
yeah there's that chapter eh
like last month no?
its been out for a while hasnt it , the pv
its the easy way to recognition tbh
and that guy might say yes and also say here's some more that might want to help
and friends tell the producer to contact this guy, this is his twitter
just like how it always goes, friends of friends
wep never made such things
even before the show started airing
revue explicitly made tweets to find people
the difference is wep didnt ask for it
yeah
also time to watch the ep now
this is both a blessing and a curse tbf
also same
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
https://puu.sh/HpFTM.png


went from small contained team in previous eps to a lot of rando's and other studio's helping out for this (and likely the rest of the eps)
Meanwhile wep is getting saved by anitwitter <:KEK:739953921895694417>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
gekidol makes even less sense with subs
can't really see xebec zwei doing it loo
i guess they could just do that at one of the other ig port studio's now
<:harold:364119409620418591>
best outcome at least
I'll probably forget about it until it starts airing
(earlier they changed the AT-X schedule for april to undecided, this explains why)
higurashi sotsu in July
ask and you shall receive
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/Ewxg_MOWQAQ2Q6X?format=jpg&name=large
but yeah the tls for mushoku and classroom already said that everything was translated and this is pure editing so probably gonna be the same for villainess also
but that's what you get by citing sankaku <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
is straight out false though
>So Seven Seas Entertainment is in trouble because it has been discovered that they have made heavy alterations to their publications of light novels without notifying the original Japanese publisher or author.
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
>actually posting sankaku in the OP
maybe this year then
even with kyoani cute girls it's still gonna be like
tamayura > yamasumes > and comfycamping getting pretty high also for me
tamayura exists
still is for me
<:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
https://twitter.com/comic_natalie/status/1372744860080300042?s=19

yessssss, actually more  tv anime
just wait for bd
should be ye
pretty good
it's freelance generally
jnovel pres said they keep their works as close as possible where it allows it.
besides them being slow and having trash tls once in a while
no idea about yen press though
I'm not really gonna buy copies to check the credits
maybe they're all the same editor<a:15min:490152487358300160>
tprobably depends on who the editor is for each one of them tbh
yah same
<:harold:364119409620418591>
but apparently that's also not okay according to purists when it has to be 1:1
i know there's also cut stuff from skeleton knight but that's more editorial changes that just remove redundant stuff tbf unlike the classroom/villainess problems
they could tell the editor to not cut out shit <a:15min:490152487358300160>
and then it will repeat itself on the next ln
at most you'll get a rerelease and another apology
^
same problem there<a:15min:490152487358300160>
ye
yes
all i expect is the same reply they gave to the classroom problem
licenses are only for like ~5 years
yeah
license expired
one of the worst sites on the planet nuff said
i would just say read the manga, it's like 8 chapters
https://anilist.co/anime/123645/Sayonara-Watashi-no-Cramer-First-Touch/
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
one who was delayed to summer
for soccer, don’t forget there's a movie prequel
so same as classroom
good old "we can't finish backgrounds" shaft
both <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
i would def sit down with him drinking alcohol while watching some trash
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
wouldnt surprise me
maybe he just clicks the ecchi genre or something
under the trash genre <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
only problem isnt going enough in the problems tbf, but still good watch
canipa's vid on aot he did yesterday is pretty good
<:harold:595434251286085653>
imagine actually finishing backgrounds in time for once and then replace them with stock image color bg
oh it is and it's also a pretty good meme  except when it isnt (nisekoi)
~~delayed episodes due to natural disaster and given the extra time they still couldnt finish backgrounds in time~~
i mean tbf it was just a matter of finding out who was part of Magica Quartet
yeah
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
that duo had the smart idea to make it out of real life props
if it wasnt for curry then the dimensions would have just looked regular
more like welcome to curry
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
also you talk about aot bgs but have you seen jjk bgs?
eh i disagree lanks
like the biggest part is in ep 3
which isnt really that big part
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
only the cgi parts do
it doesnt actually look like trash
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
also the most popular movie now
<:15min:655058014495047690>
just look at demon slayer
i mean looking good doesnt mean its gonna be good
there's no way it's going to be good
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
it's gonna be shit though solopy
still rather read/watch aot then demon slayer
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
and aot is a juggernaut, it wouldnt have mattered if the season 4 came before or after the manga ends
not by doing it before
they can keep the manga sales going longer after the manga ends with anime
which doesnt really matter?
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so why they even bothered in the first place
the next part will be after the manga ends
they arent even gonna finish it
its proven time and time again you dont need to put out an anime just for the manga to end
it's also the committee's fault for wanting it so soon
mappa version is just the uninspired panel for panel adaptation
the other seasons didnt had that as much bcs wit took liberties with the adaptation
its the same in the manga
there isnt more
its actually fairly panel per panel
its not really that rushed
not
jp yugioh and 4kids yugioh are such different shows all together
changing whole plotlines outright
4kids yugioh is fun
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
hey you wanna know something, this ep of uma musume is featured by ||drama||
lmao solopy
not a genre
it's just a demographic
every shounen goes on too long anyway and while the final arc isnt amazing either, its still more cohesive then whatever bleach did for final arc
manga is pretty alright tbf
they pretty much defined current shounen
<:15min:655058014495047690>
naruto, one piece and bleach
i just wanna see how they're gonna adapt the awful final arc
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
actually gonna watch the bleach anime
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
actually liked his dad also
miyano is also close by he's not as soothing as those 2
him and akio are probs my current fav male va's
miki is just amazing
by count > <https://puu.sh/Hrsa5.jpg>
by score > <https://puu.sh/HrsaB.jpg>
i havent watching yugioh in dubs since the og
heh
but thats still 4kids just under the new name
now they go with the name as Konami Cross Media NY
they went from 4kids to 4k media after 2012 when konami bought them
well they got bought out by konami later so technically yeah firezero
they got the old gang together
they did the dub
4kids owns the rights
<:15min:655058014495047690>
and that was fine
4kids still did the dark side of dimensions movie
yes
<:rubycry:394118717950263303>
i'm back from the horsies ep, this is me
well i have horsies to watch now
i guess? you can at least end with whatever you girl you want.
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
if it was successful, why not repeat it
smart
but ayase was best girl
would just have to rip and include pgs (although it's still aniplex subs so pretty trash)
it comes with subs
31 march
for it to make semi sense
and not having to rush and scramble to put it sort of in the final movie
they could have at least actually animated the content required
i dont think they're like bad movies per se but if you want the hf story properly animated then they're not it.
and if you want a ||true|| route adaptation, the movies are just not it
oui
the things they cut actually hurt them really hard for the last movie
the third one really doesnt
HF movies are a pretty bad interpretation of the arc anyway
the only one out of the science adventures adaptations <:15min:655058014495047690>
none of the anime is a good representation anyway <:15min:655058014495047690>
but isnt it fine
hello, welcome, we don't do happy horses here.
<a:15min:490152487358300160>

<a:15min:490152487358300160>

also superior
i feel the pain
<:GENOCIDE:657729913050103871>
still the same
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
solve everything by not solving anything
me neither
in a way
but hey i guess everything was resolved
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
as bad as take 1
twas a thing alrtight
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
well i didnt put it as finished until i saw the subbed version for 12
<:harold:595434251286085653>
first finished anime this season is gekidol
it's amazing
(also wep is delayed by a bit)
time to watch ~~best~~ show this season <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
well have fun trying to change the way the whole industry work.
They're not even sure if they can actually finish the next ep on time and its been like that since the recap
actually hope the last ep gets delayed for a while (as bad as that may read), they could use the break.
could lead you being blacklisted and not getting work offers
well you generally don't want to leak that stuff if you're also on the production
he deleted it
yeah i dont recall any ships in the part i played
<:15min:655058014495047690>
maybe bcs blue reflection is a ship
already dropped the shows from last season i lost interest in so likely gonna finish the rest
i'll finish them over the next season ~~maybe~~
so they sort of have to reintroduce them for the anime now?
was just wondering bsc the introduction to the chars is the delayed movie
lmao lanks
i wonder if they'll add an introduction to the first ep for cramer
the real strat is to watch it whenever
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
or saturday even
when sub comes out
so would still be sunday depending on your timezone
yes but that means 2-3am 4 april then
tcomes out 4 april
and by that i wont bcs i'll be doing other shit instead
i hope
well its gonna help catching up to the older shows im still watching
<:15min:655058014495047690>
https://puu.sh/Hs7fn.jpg
everything else just looks trash
at least we don't have to worry about intl when those are already all owned by sony <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
tubi tv also
<a:15min:490152487358300160>
Netflix
I'm surprised they even bothered in the first place tbh
there's also several smaller ones
don't think they'll block it tbf, sony could argue there's actually enough other streaming services with anime for it not to be a monopoly
<:Hinatuuuh:811553016477122560>
looks at disney
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
ya
not like most of the anime with that tag actually be on a boat majority of the time
same
the anime is kind of its own thing so who knows what tags would be right
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's already bad enough gold ship and mcqueen are actually related (god bless they aren't in the anime)
not if they want to follow the real horse stories that is
nah rice is never happening unless they cut short like silence suzuka
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
golden ship is their vtuber mc
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
imagine s3 but with ||another set of mcs||
in both ways
at least its almost over
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
but you need to have genshin impact on it
yeah! imagine not including one of her better roles
~~also depending on when it airs~~
it has pretty good staff so hopefully
<:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
cute girl
that's also what the author is about
like the chariot things should just have never been explained, keep it a mystery even if the viewer knows
i just cant care about croix and the whole chariot plotline
trigger not doing trigger things is a lot better
it was just trigger doing trigger things which is awful
meanwhile the second half was just whatever to me
ye
while the rest was more akin to traditional triggeresque shows
good dumb fun
the mushroom ep was actually one of my more fav eps in the whole series
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
more like i enjoyed it but it lost like all of the magic the ova's had
well awful might be too strong a word
the tv series was awful <:15min:655058014495047690>
those were good
just give me more ova's
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
for all we know the IP isnt listed bcs there is no panty and stockings at the exhib
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
yeah bcs not listing the IP means trigger has gotten it
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
and now we wait
https://twitter.com/garupan/status/1375220952989065230?s=21
Although it was mainly China in 2015, 16,17,18 iirc and then they had those new laws and more focus on own animation works so america took over for 19,20
it's been like this since 2015 or so
I'm with fenny  tbf
honestly original movies are kind of fun in it's own right
talking about movies, jjk also announced a movie
BC should be announcing a movie after final ep according to leaks
<:harold:595434251286085653>
well s2 takes all of the bad parts and makes them even worse
yeh s2 is till v6
<:15min:655058014495047690>
im a go hibernate till it's out
should be recap tho so I'm skipping
yeh
boys band
it's vampire idols
https://twitter.com/visualprison/status/1375634746215079936?s=19
did someone ask for more agematsu?
its unusual
and splits are generally called part 1 and part 2 anyway
it's worse
the spoilers don't do the show justice <:LUL:545650745534447631>
just final season
i like how its still called final season, not even part 2 or something
heh
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
hold your horses people
the whole panty & stocking IP is missing from the copyrights list

3 years gap of no blogs from 17 to 20
this is his blog
https://ameblo.jp/kokage2010/page-1.html
he should have a twitter
i know he has a blog, i should have it bookmarked somewhere
i don't think he has twitter or pixiv
or he's trying to write oneshots that are getting declined for publish
wouldn't surprise me if he quit
would you keep writing manga when the publisher refused to give you assistants? and getting passed out multiple times a week killing your body bcs you had to do everything alone for a weekly release?
the manga for keijo was already planned to end before the anime aired
it's not like it was outright said, it's just conjecture
nobody knows

it's just funny it happened now while gohands has been doing this for over 10 years
maybe
ep 13 as a special god knows when <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
i like the end where teio and mcqueen did that training race ||only way to do it bcs neither of them ever raced again||
part of the charm
yeh
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
spoiler ||teio wins irl||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
so its also useless
toei has an union but they follow whatever the ceo does
they have unions, anime not really
a1 so ye
the sao movie wasn't that lucky
he's lucky enough to get that treatment at least
(that said he started storyboarding ep 4 last week when ep 3 came out)
if they aired it as a tv series he likely would have make a lot of constraints on his setpieces
Mizushima is just enjoying the treatment gup gets so he can keep making grand setpieces for each movie release
they're still produced in the same way a tv-anime would be and don't really improve much.
to the point Hosoda has been complaining about late night anime making movies
movies are a different industry all together
<:EliThink:333474581761228812>
or was it PA works
A1 had that animator die on desk
this is also a pretty severe case.
and all that keeps them going is love for anime bcs they sure as hell won't be paid properly
i didn't like the direction the story is taken so doubt I'll like this ep much
ye
sometimes i hope the bubble burst
and finish it a couple hours before broadcast
and not a week
least they have 3 months for the final ep
<:harold:595434251286085653>
right onto the next show they go
there's another one who mentioned he lost 13kgs during the course of the show
it's generally not this bad but still bad in general

https://twitter.com/kawakami_yu/status/1376946317121835011?s=19

this is how fucked egg production is
sort of yes
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
op recap 1 chapter with fill time, ed
so like every one piece ep?
for the most part
it still looks pretty
the sci-fi plot stuff from the last few eps is uninteresting
^
that was lanks joking anyway
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
like for example take everyones favourite studio Mappa.
>Dumb people: Mappa is fine, they have 200 inhouse staff

>>those 200 inhouse staff aren't animators
they are yes, still quite a bunch of inhouse staff on most studio's ofc.
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
coincidence no?
only then to get sentenced to 2 years and a fine like a week later for driving without a license
like that one guy that didn't get paid and went to an union and then he got paid
you can count them on one hand for the anime industry
there has been some "succesful" cases the past few years but eh
they do, but they're not specialized in movies so whenever they do a movie it's still done as a tv-anime production
yeh it's pretty bad
lol
i'm gonna watch it after work at home
we're gonna get either official subs edits so still trash, mtl subs so still trash or just trash fansubs tls
and the problem is
<:15min:655058014495047690>
they were still trash
every single anime
every aniplex sub are trash cypher
its aniplex so they'll be trash
really soon

if you order on time cdjapan tends to ship like 1 to 2 days beforehand so that you also get it on release date
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
cdjapan shipped it monday
not good, i need to wait 10hs to watch it now
oh <@87512939107450880> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/213918855196704769/826770840573706260/DSC_0443.JPG

arrived as I had to go to work
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
watch it <:15min:655058014495047690>
fate hf3: visual spectacle ||and a sort of gutted true end so not really the true end|| so when are we getting a good hf adaptation <:15min:655058014495047690>
yeah they're doing a pretty big push for the franchise, 24 ep anime, sequel game, phone/pc game
well i need to continue this fate movie now <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
it has different characters
its fine
actually disagree on that
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
they're banking pretty hard on it
well seeing as the game is gonna get a sequel
should be pretty hard to fuck up, its not even a proper adaptation of the game
<:15min:655058014495047690>
and nobody knows why
it is
too busy watching spring song tho <:LUL:545650745534447631>
cypher maybe
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
~~is one of them fairy tail in space~~
hard to explain without spoiling.
i did
yes
better then ||saber vs zerker from hf2||
it's so good
oh i know you'll love that part
<:sweat:694016535483645982>
Rider though
||and falls flat at the end bcs of it||
its just not enough
they try at the start of the movie
and you already know about the illya stuff anyway
||the monologue and shit is removed||
nah its theire visually and shit
half and half, sec
they gutted ||nine lives||
go in for story with vn knowledge that is
for entertainment and visuals its like a solid 9.5/10 and for anime only it's probably a 8/10 but if you go in for story its maybe a 5 or 6/10
don't expect too much cyph
i've been meaning to sort that drive for a while tbf
indeed
i actually need to get a new drive bcs that one is close to full
the other 3 are small drives though
out of 4
i mean thats only 1 drive
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
https://puu.sh/HuCXc.png
its watchable
better then 2 but still meh
same
probably some convention in china
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
oh i thought you just meant international
france the other country who beats it i guess?
which also reminds me i still need to watch the bondrew movie
oh that's cool actually
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
this might sound dumb,but she was the best part about hf3
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
when can I marry sakura myself
so
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
good thing its been years since i played hf route so a lot of shit was hazy

too much to read

overal same tbh
based wakanim
<:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
just do what you feel like doing
its as bs as just watching trailers only
im just glad it looks like they're not gonna rush it bcs its 24 eps (although split cour)
and idk what
i like the novels but there's somethign about the anime that makes me go eh
thunderbolt fantasy s3 ep 1 was better tough <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
and then shots that's just mirroring gridman.
has some pretty good shots
where's the mikasa clone nodding yes, bcs that would be me
(its from the movie but its kek)
lemme find the best delta video actually
~~wtb better discord search~~
man i can't find it reee
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
that vid is the sole reason ytt subbed the macross delta movie

<a:MeltDance:768807501617168416>
oh shit i found it
<:15min:655058014495047690>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cP-Xiq45Eos
that one from iris reminds me of zetman OP
im surprised i can actually play it
it does sound better then average abilities
~~ones an isekai so doubt~~
clearly inferior to endro
although i still think the last few eps are pretty garbage
tae is amazing
you need to get better taste
<:15min:655058014495047690>
it only has 2 good things and one of them is him and the other is tae
zombieland?
but yes only mug and cub are the pure sols this season
zombieland isnt sol tho
that show only exists to promote the city
mug cup might be a bigger ad
looks pretty good also trailer wise
https://anilist.co/anime/113418/Super-Cub/
more excited about super cub sol tbf
i still have to watch 230 eps of other shit, not liek im in a rush
i can live with 3 days late
apparently it airs tomorrow on cr
cr is late casting it
https://anilist.co/anime/122148/Yakunara-Mug-Cup-Mo/
its been 2 days
ree
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
reminds me cup doesnt seem to get subbed
just give me sol
thanks
right i should finish that
(its used as ed in ep 9)

>gigguk ever having a good take
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
good times when precure was almost cancelled
t-r-a-s-h
remake is <:JustFine:597629265147723777>
original is trash
fruit basket is pretty good
and there's not much ufo could do for that
bcs you had this cool looking shit and then you had ||>fists||
it just at a really bad point
and only bcs we had ||saber vs rider just before that||
you know what felt empty ||the fist fight||
that already had a new anime announced
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
and they'll call it Fate Stay Night Réalta Nua
or just meme the show
<:15min:655058014495047690>
nah HF remake tv anime version
they adding that would have already made it a lot better
they lost part of the charm by cutting out the monologue
just create one
like he creates his swords
just create one
pls
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
ifyouknowwhatimean
just unlimited bladeworks one
i mean
mix is the keyword here
doesnt mean they didnt take from it
they did
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
||the true end||
you know what also got robbed?
you can say that about like 90% of the HF content tho
i honestly don't think they could have made it any better
<:15min:655058014495047690>
what would one more be
shirou is already damaged character
wdym
eh rather had that cut out then some of the other stuff
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
it's not even bad
i would take ||grail monster version bcs that shit was so good in the movie||
would you take ||angra like norlam or grail monster version||
he  sucks
rude
ye and it should be the same stuff anyway
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
super cub
best show is wednesday
half of the shows I'm watching already came out
but well time for me to nap, also boule lmao
maybe if i had a deskjob nova
i don't have time for that
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
they don't
soon
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
imagine watching shounen or action when you can watch girls riding a super cub
i care about the girls
best genre
slice of life is good
https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/39/1972_Honda_C70.JPG/260px-1972_Honda_C70.JPG
it's a moppet thing
super cub
don't tempt me
the best days
even more time to procrastinate
gotta wait for funi/cr for that <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
easily my fav premiere
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
mostly when it involves drugs but they haven't cited the reason.
for japan? yes tbh
just so good a show
we checked and it only had 114 lines with 22 of them being typesetting. (and the monologues were cut)
(the merch went up today and P&S is listed with khara)
some weeks back with imaishi expo website going up people noticed P&S didnt had gainax listed anymore and people jumped ship thought trigger would have it now. Turns out it's Khara
it was about getting the rights away from gainax so they couldn't mismanage it
it was never about a sequel
moving from the other channel bcs i'm dumb
(khara has the rights to P&S, unlike prev assumed Trigger would after the  P&S trademarks were dropped on the Imaishi expo)
heh, i only have like 3 shows today
(better then 3.0)
its supposed to be pretty good a movie
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
all i know is that anno trolled people
god knows
its okay, 4.0 saves all of the rebuilds <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
if only the subs weren't garbage eh
yep
who basically worked on every shaft title the past 10 years.
idk if i would call it a reunion tbf, none of the real core members of monogatari are on it. It's just the remainder of the inhouse staff shaft has left.
and i would have to focus too much on the subs to appreciate the rest bcs im not that fluent
and i would have to go the Brussels or something
but i live on the dutch side, and the french side gets the good movies
lol
im from belgium
i do
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
im even willing to watch it with french subs
same
||its neither of those 2||
or so the rumor goes
yes
nah boule the which ||waifu wins||
the other half is live action
yes
Although ep 2 of mug was kind of w/e
i live for cgdct
<:harold:595434251286085653>
bar the other 30 or something idk shows lmao

my schedule is just packed from all of shows i still need to finish lol
rumbling hearts at 2 is pretty peak
<:harold:595434251286085653>
but isekai
eww
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
it's my fav hate to watch show
date a ~~shit~~ live
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
only if that means we get sekirei s3, lanks
<:shemsleep:720894365064626197>
all the rest looks like
slime for me
christ
fall has the best show with what's gonna be a pretty bad adaptation if other entries are a given <:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
and that likely still doesn't have the majority of them announced
im gonna loop and say that I'm gonna watch more shows in fall then summer
<:ServalMad:539799753467363339>
why even live
no pure sol next season
<:harold:595434251286085653>
at least higurashi if i actually finish current one before summer
yes
that's about it for me on first glance
slime, dragon maid, mahouka spinoff, love live, aquarium girls, higurashi
<:EliThink:333474581761228812>
can't help it the author for the ln loves honda
the show is just a tourism add so I'm not expecting much from it in the end
for cute real girls
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
plot plot or plot
<:rkkYikes:733904001795620945>
i grew out of my shitty ecchi phase for the most part.
like trashy harems and isekai
meanwhile i actually just want more of them, granted for spice i just read other things.
sol is my lifeline
yuri stories like that generally aren't really my thing, usually prefer more basic stuff like Girlfriends etc
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
in a way
well i suppose that counts
<:harold:595434251286085653>
oh no
maybe an actual animated pv will change my mind
looks like an easy skip
the what now
also why i aint watching bakarina<a:15min:490152208827154442>
not even yuri or y.aoi is gonna get me to watch 300 slimes
and even if it's sort of meh i could just look at the bgs in that show
same
ep 2 today, hope that isn't gonna disappoint
first ep had me hoping bcs it felt so much like a worse version of tamayura but then ep 2 was eh
i feel ya
fast for a change
that one doesn't future over the top gore tho
but yeah i was gonna say murcielago anime when but then it would just be a black screen half of the time
<:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
~~i block everyone who dms me tbf, if its for no reason~~
😩
have some willpower
<:bbdisgust:639169734117425164>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
watch out for lanks
i blocked enough people here already <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
that doesn't change what i said
it's best to never interact with any fandom
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
which is a high bar
komi fandom manages to be worse then shounen fandoms
who knows I'll never read it
komi was never good <a:15min:490152208827154442>
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
https://youtu.be/z5hfWlnhTqk

starlight movie trailer
details is all the show has for it, like it's really limited in its animation
this was my favorite scene this ep
<:Blessindianguy:783540919013212191>
<@171395487247630336> did you like the ep?
yes
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
cub was good
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
at least we have his roar every ep
im sure of it
hope godzilla shows up soon though <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
yeah
pretty good ep
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
still a movie
or gundam build shows
still i wouldn't mind another tv show instead of movies
I'll watch the g-reco movies after they're done with low expectations, least they seem to be fine according to huntr.
it's bad
the whole show is a mess
it's sad enough they even have to release movies to save that awful show
don't take it literally
well after that he said, how else will I stay motivated
(and his camera storyboarding is really bad)
but I guess getting millipensee as studio means as extension you're gonna have him as director
not something like kumo
yeh itagaki is more of a problem on the show. Like he's a good director but just keep him on wacky fastpaced shit.
but the cgi company is different
yes in broad terms
only the truth
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
sheryl singing va > ranka > sheryl
and if we want to be precise
just write it down as the few differences
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
ranka better
lion is the best frontier song
at least post Lion
still gonna watch it though, for ono and the possible sympho gang <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:okay:330354891727962122>
i just like reading about arc punching something
so far the world building is fine, i'm only at start of v4 though
humans bad <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
of course with the added girls and other shit
so far from the volumes i've read it's just about him traveling the world to fix this curse of flesh
its a joke on arc being an "overpowered" skeleton like ainz except as a warrior instead of a caster
you know what they say, gacha bad <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
this one whaled for a limited avatar in an mmorpg and then died and got stuck with the skeleton avatar
nah
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
it's basically ainz warrior persona
cypher this one is sasuga ainz sama <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
i like the ln, at least the traveling parts of it
time for symphogear boogaloo
<:obama:439779824299540491>
Ono at KAI
<:obama:439779824299540491>
oh skeleton knight anime announced
that's koimoko something actually
<:15min:655058014495047690>
before isekai we had isekai, people just didnt call it isekai
and one is better at it then the rest of her character
can't help they have different va's for the singing <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
>Aniplex
bcs Loris
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
the US version is like 200+
cheap
bcs it fits
if you think op setting is static you sure arent watching/reading it
its not
~~even oda has more variety~~
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
wendy adult
man that's eh what was her name
<:15min:655058014495047690>
laxus jr, gray jr, lucy jr, shera jr
whenever she has her bulky armor on  they're pretty hidden
but yeah i get what you mean
<:15min:655058014495047690>
good try tho cypher
>her most used armor is just bandages
erza is the upgrade
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
esp in the mid department , like lucy
the show needed more cow tbh
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
the best fairy tail content is the ova's
the manga has no filler
but yeah after timeskip it was w/e
some of the stuff after was better
eh disagree
FT should have ended at tenrou
<:15min:655058014495047690>
that was the shit one
and yeah its way to soon for edens zero
fairy tail never recovered after timeskip <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
whenever he plans on doing a time skip
halfway through it will go to shit
its also mashima so
<a:rungoose:736616365791641623>
bcs its rie
i also like happy
<:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
wrong
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
cypher finally said something correct about fairy tail
imagine that
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yeah he should have asked, why is her eye over her hair?
(animation wise)
good episode, was kinda rough around the edges tho
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
~~komisan anime leaked~~
will do lmao
it's from a private discord
steal it
but yeah ep 3 was better then 2 tbh even though it was rough as i mentioned
if she smiles, i smile
every time
this one is just all about koguma finding something to do in her (sad) life and seeing her smile is the best
those do focus on comedy at times, unlike this one.
or nnb
yes
it's a slow burn
which makes it better then the rest
```Iyashikei (癒し系) is Japanese for "healing", a term used for anime and manga created with the specific purpose of having a healing or soothing effect on the audience. Works of this kind often involve alternative realities with little to no conflict, emphasizing nature, the mundane and the little delights in life.```
so no they don't
this is more akin to an iyashikei

yeh

it fits both ways so they should
just like the word stan <:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>

can't believe gen is actually finished playing with his dolls
even if he wouldnt write the movie (he still is anyway)
he's part of magica quartet so he's always gonna be involved
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
yeah sea is pretty nice for that
madoka is one of the few i would go to cinema's for
would be nice but i dont think it would be shown here
rebellion was 2013 <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

it's probably gonna miyamoto again but just tell us
just announce the director <:KEK:739953921895694417>

sequel movie officially announced
https://natalie.mu/comic/news/425930
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
well part of it that is
but walpurgis is the title of the movie
he wrote the movie's draft before puppets s1 which came out in '16 so he has thing thing ready for quite a few years now.
(and how much he actually wants to update it)
probably depends on how old his draft is tbh
oh Gen wrote the draft quite a while ago lmao
considering the subtitle
still more interested in what role walpurgis will play
the season does have 12 eps but the first 6 are the prequel movies adapted as tv-anime
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
half of 12 eps so 1.5
the sequel is 6 eps
twas announced a while back, we just didnt had a date.
👀
https://twitter.com/RanobeSugoi/status/1387064059451699203?s=19
(should be taken down now by now tho)
lmao someone fucked up and made the demon slayer movie ( jp and eng sub) already available for purchase on the ps4 store. the release date was supposed to be june 22.
yeah
this show
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
after last weeks rough looking ep we had a solo AD and KA ep
really good ep
<:hinatahappy:813070375725301819>

super cub <:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
sony leads the committee for kimetsu so not like they're actually gonna be in trouble
well the guy who did probably
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
i would just go s1 into s2 tbh
the only thing for s2 is amazon subs are super trash
just watch it in order tbh
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
that's why you watch the better romance anime where things actually happen
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
the good yns
keep me updated on progress
<:hinatahappy:813070375725301819>
<:crybasa:773199802249904149>
and then you have the 4 part final movie
the og ova isn't as strong but it gets going on s1 and s2
but yeah the show is work checking out, esp if you like slice of life
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
but as an iyashikei most people are like meh
it's still my most fav show
😐
just watch tamayura
still trying to figure out what pottery is trying to go for as a sol
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
aoi yuuki next ep
you know the most anime not anime show
thunderbolt fantasy
puppets still a good watch
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
it oozes yns style

if you want yama's while not being yama's add DIY to your list
i can see that at times
ive taken so much screenshots every time she smiles
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
they got the prev volumes so should be fine
kadokawa bought out j-novel club a bit ago
hmm, was gonna say if it was a kadokawa publisher it would have been easier to prolly get new licenses
the jp publisher
is it a kadokawa brand?
where does picnic get published under?
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
<:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
my second fav is prolly just because
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
tsuki ga kirei
yeh
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
fireworks is also a movie i thought you were talking bout
fireworks was trash though
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
and catch up reading the manga
will probably do so closer to s2 release date
i have to admit i still haven't watched the bondrew movie
https://twitter.com/miabyss_anime/status/1389747016280932353
ye
more importantly s2
thought it was fine
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:harold:595434251286085653>
same
and wait god knows how long for the other parts
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>

madhouse it's director was the one who originally said he's not adapting anything after s3 as that's where the web novel ended and he only wanted to adapt till that
well we don't even know if its them
i like overlord but s3 was just so bad
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
why
overlord s4 and a movie
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
well her name is public so all you would have to do is skip to the sentai credits and check
but yeah would have to see who was the tl for sentai
oregarui was good past ep 1 (they replaced the tl)
like iski said
they also outright said it.
yes
is it blocking the client or the connections
<:hyp:250363576005558272>
<:obama:461648244049707012>
that dynazenon cliffhanger
bcs ive been watching anime for more then a decade lol
i know

<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:harold:595434251286085653>
and then 2019 <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
kyoani just has a lot to thank from Kigami, he pretty much shaped the studio into what it became. he was called a pillar of kyoani for a reason.
~~but they're all from the same designer~~
yes
Kigami is just that good<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
so 90% of the time <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
well niji had like production problems
the actual song stuff in niji is better then the other series at least
i still like the sunshine dance cgi more then what i saw from niji performances
ll has had great cgi for dances since the first movie tbh
happy to bring the news tho
dun care dun watch
and its in 2022 so there's like a pretty good gap imo
well they probably would have announced it earlier if the live didn't kept being delayed
i always bring real, good news <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yes
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
I'm not watching it
it's never meant to be the mainline series
well niji isn't mainline
next season
summer
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/192297453251330048/840905203347881984/unknown.png

<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
sukamoka is ending soon™️
anime when (+sukasula final volume anime)
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
yes
no but studio's are
most just dont have their finances public
that's like any studio really
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>

still think it didnt need a s2
aint watching any of those <:LUL:545650745534447631>
though i may sound overly negative, but zls is still a fine show.
same
~~and then we have the dumb production of the show~~
well i wasn't a fan of the end of s1 either when it did it's dumb repeat final arc and same for s2 so far which is just whatever. Like last weeks ep with tae was fun but this ep was just pure s1 parody.
as in, finally a good episode in s2.

<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
~~so that everyone can enjoy the amazing bgs without even watching the show~~
~~and to backtrack like 5mins, show put up a gallery~~
https://supercub-anime.com/gallery/
both
i know about satoko and stuff
yea
i know bits and pieces
no work tomorrow so probably gonna binge a few more eps
still only half way there, finished 11 yesterday
im catching up on gou
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
nice cypher
they probably would have sold it if they didnt had it in prod
mostly bcs it's in production together with uru in the blue
yes
sneaks in way too late,  Top wo nerae 3 is at Gaina (rebrand of gainax)
gonna have to wait for the movie stuff if the packs are also returning there
that's a kit for the new manga model
call me when the 5 other movies are out for pripri to watch it.
wouldn't surprise me if Fukuda will use his late wife's plot outline for it tbh
finally news
but hey it's been 15 years since they announced the seed movie <:LUL:545650745534447631>
fits better in 00 then seed
yeah that's what i'm reading everyone
but the og animation was all about "life", distortions etc etc which they traded in for clean, overreliance on extreme digital effects, etc etc
it looks good ofc
they're keeping the clean lifeless version
yeh
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
instead it's more alicization style
if only they could have went back to s1 style
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
>adapt properly
>already announced an og char
F
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
then yes
do you like the movie?
yeah
this only tracks late night anime so its why ghibili movies are missing etc
yeh
https://puu.sh/HKT6t.png
>only on 1400+ screenings
girls und panzer
der film
except it made like 2 billion yen and they never saw anything of it
so they did for the movie
most studio's are just contracted and get a set amount of money for x project
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
>make movie for popular series
>went overbudget, had to pay out of own pockets
>movie makes bank
>studio isn't on the committee

Actas
or they wouldn't have seen a penny
luckily enough for ufo they're on the committee eh
~~understandable, he didn't want people to know the cafés make more money then his anime studio <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>~~
lol
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
barely even watching 10 shows on time
maybe I'll watch it later
fairy tail in space? no sir
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
and he was embezling funds from the cafés
not the studio itself

it's the ufotable syndrome dw

<https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-05-31/gundam-seed-director-mitsuo-fukuda-confirms-film-is-sequel-to-destiny/.173440>

it is based on the script from his late wife
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
at least you czn save the pieces for the future
buy zls get granblue codes
like every other cygames anime
at least its not granblue codes
~~for the same price of you trying to whale~~
if you get all of the boxes you will have enough pieces to 5star one horse to your liking
the codes for this is giving you 3star ticket and 500 pieces and support card with the box art
hoping on s3 then with KAI and the sympho gang then
~~i might also have bought one~~

there's always a few roles they do they're different

<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
in case of sora my mind goes to  milky holmes first then nico
totally understandable

poor girl lost her voice on the final live final day
nozomi isn't that bad in terms of having to force her voice
kotori va

she had to go under knife to save her voice
it costed uchi her voice
just like uchi in og LL she's unfortunately stuck with the grating voice instead of a natural one
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fwRfp112ewo
her voice actors natural voice^
anime voice^
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fQabV56gtRc
it's time to find back that ruby video again lmao
👁️
looks at ruby
it's so different usually
the best part is hearing a VA speak in their natural voice
but its the first volumes that do best, not the last ones <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
Bakemonogatari still has the best average sales since people started tracking this and that ones from 2009, still hasn't been beat.
https://puu.sh/HLmYv.png
wonder what s2 average is actually gonna be in the end
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
<@!139432096023183360> https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/448260634161840133/849200624188260362/saved_1622535600445.jpg
the gag series isn't any particularly good , you can easily skip it and not miss anything
yeah later
but they're like 12mins ep
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
there's butai and it's movie and world butai
there's like brave witches and the gag series
ofc saki herself doing it every time is pretty impossible
i did once
i love saki
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
yes
i would guess anywhere between 50-80k for the other 3 volumes
there's also the mobage codes but those shouldn't be able to hold the series on the 110k+ per volume
and they have been smart, if the live gets canceled by covid you can use it as a code for a digital version of the live.
it has live event ticket
same
it's been sold out for like 2 months on every retailer though, expect it to go higher in following weeks
which is a really unlikely
it will drop unless the 3 other volumes also sell 112k
but that's the average total
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
I'm still watching it
||nopan||
but the best about saki world is
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
or you get 15 pages and 9 of them are just line art
it's been better the past 10 chapters or something but sometimes you're unlucky you get 6 pages
waiting and waiting
<:FeelsBadMan:642850206869618699>
but god i wish achiga stayed like in the anime
and thats not even main line saki cast
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
man when you start thinking about the cast on saki you realize how much big names they have
probably good take take a screenshot of everyone at the start whenever you meet a new someone and compare them to the current manga
now to the manga
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
mahjong with powers
<:ServalMad:539799753467363339>
ritz confirmed in a blog like 90% of the females are lesbian in the saki world
it's pretty gay
toki is cute
~~half of the chapters are also released unfinished~~
ritz is wild, no boob is ever consistent
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
enjoy the boob physics tho
then start the manga and when you're at the latest chapter, hate ritz for his achiga boners
watch achiga
~~after he gets off his achiga boner that is~~
so maybe they can adapt more then
i jus twish ritz would ever finish the national tournament
same
<:15min:655058014495047690>
the best brave witches ep is the ep where sanya and eila appear
the rest of the cast is better but SW has mnuch better dynamics with eachother
Hikaru is just so much worse then miyafuji for me
didnt like brave witches all that much
but yeah it was supposed to be fan service and stuff
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
before the final final boss
yes after it became a final boss
it's good but not a very starter friendly season
in not an all stars movie
seeing some of the old gang cures was fun
some of the best hugtto eps we're ironically (or not) the eps with all of the seasons cures
yea
it also was unfortunate to air after hugtto and star twinkle
>we can't handle it
>mid season cure can handle it
for way too many eps
my only irk is that they let the mid season cure do too much
when they start exploring Honoka's character more the show thrives
the second half of the show is much better then the first half
weak start, decent middle, nice end
i'm not too worried, the start is better then healin good so far
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
unless they change it from other cure shows
each one of them is likely gonna get a bigger arc that explores there character probably
the mid season cure tend to get the better writing anyway
to what laura is now, theyér very aware
she was supposed to be genki like manatsu, but she had that role so they changed her
they were
gonna read the male focused spinoff?
if ritz does a chapter a month it's only 5 years <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
saki||I'm expecting for saki vs teru to happen in the individuals so they battle it out and talk through mahjong in the finals, while the team loses the group tournament||
<:FeelsBadMan:642850206869618699>
literally
Hisa match is gonna be pain
12 ep anime only for the vanguard match <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
maybe if ritz hurried up we could get another anime before we get reborn
yeh ritz has generally good char building
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
ah yes another confirmation they don't know the existence of panties in saki world
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
the best part was the nopan
it's extremely anime tho
twas good to see teru backstory tho
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
good thing saki is the flower that grows on mountains and achigas best player is a mountain
that's the problem, they didn't do anything that special and now each one of them so far has super dumb power ups compared to everyone else
but yeah hope you get my ritz achiga wank now
some consistency would have been nice
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
ritz boobs are nic eh
finally someone to talk saki manga about
<:obama:439779824299540491>
anything goes <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
and yet they are in hugtto
hugtto kinds of shits on it but none of these precures should happen at the same time
bcs like

never saw the mappa goat memes?
Mappa
jc are in a rough few years and are still getting out of it but at least they still have production lines unlike the goat studio.
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
jc staff can do up to 7
mappa only does 1 anime a season, 2 at most
they are the biggest contractor studio nowadays so that makes sense.
but in all fairness, jc staff also pumps out 90% more shows in a year then majority of other studio's so shit would get skewed towards them.
old habits die hard, it's all I'll say
<a:15min:490152208827154442>

super cub 10 ending: AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
(also counts for s1 btw)
the leads have better chemistry then s1 leads tho
more drama sports focused
it is a cockroach
that's me
and praise potte
well you know what to do then <:15min:655058014495047690>
also have you seen tamayura yet, i dont remember
i have a few laying around that i haven't actually started
the line delivery killed me, followed by koguma's face.
basically yeah
at least the finale looks like it will be a banger
there's no actual reason to even explain ||what happened between the 2 seasons||, it's just padding
everything before that was redundant
the last 6mins or so of the ep was pretty good
this ep was whatever for most of the ep besides the what i'm pretty sure was a love live sunshine reference before plot went kicking in
Lily was good, tae second ep was whatever
anyway
Gundam Hathaway is coming to netflix and they did some other new "original" announcements

chad koguma is amazing
i died when this was practically the first line of the ep
https://puu.sh/HPnR6.png

watching it rn
~~and not a good thing~~
crazy amount though
eva rebuild movies also sold like 300k+ or something
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
movies aren't even counted for this loris lmao
reminds me of the kings raid show, also had bds canceled for "various reasons"
correct
i posted
<@139432096023183360> you should go to the ann review thread for super cub and read the last page. some didn't lile the last ep<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
lol i saw some of the panels of the manga chapter equivalent for the super cub ep and its so fan servicey
in Pine Jam I trust
<:nani:241228065357824001>
15 eps for that
I'm sure the french side will air it here but im also not driving there
i would like to see Belle also but that's just not gonna show in theaters here
god knows when they'll be available
I'm not even looking at movies
no idea about what the story will be but for an animation nerd like me, Natsume pulled out all stops and called up all of the real good people <:LUL:545650745534447631>
Sonny boy is probably my most interesting one
while we're talking about summer
https://puu.sh/HOE6J.jpg
remake and kanajo are like ?????? maybe's if i feel like watching trash
i hadnt even heard of this cr original before until now lmao
literally got posted minutes ago also <:LUL:545650745534447631>
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2021/06/16-1/crunchyroll-and-adult-swim-reveal-new-fena-pirate-princess-trailer-main-staff-and-more
on a cr original that apparently gonna show in summer???
yes
well I asssume it will be in the next ep seeing as it's the final
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
shii's synopsis on the website spoils that she gets a cub
should be next ep
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
~~i do agree tho~~
<https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-06-17/gundam-yoshikazu-yasuhiko-working-on-unannounced-anime-film/.174096>

it better not be gundam
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
yasuke*
and sasuke sort of
mostly just Eden and thats it really tbh
as much hand in it like in let's say violet evergarden <a:15min:490152208827154442>
https://twitter.com/ultimatemegax/status/1405575460210233344?s=19
they just bought the license
in all seriousness I don't think netflix is to blame for this
but this is like beating a dead horse rn
pretty standard for Mappa though, even if it's bad <:LUL:545650745534447631>
yes
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>

<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
slideshow montage
everything skipped and everything that still had to be adapted
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
they just put everything in a slideshow montage
hence i said neverland style
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
neverland style
spider next week, hold my beer we'l lfinish both <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
fuck nice
yeh <:LUL:545650745534447631>
that was actually negative points for me
i watched it bcs it's good <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
we all know who the va is though <:LUL:545650745534447631>
yeah
i dun remember
no i was asking if she spoke before in the show
good i'll leave it at that
its a dead give away if you recognize the voice
ye
she spoke tho ikxi
did shiro speak before <:think_jii:688734639094890520>  ||if you know your va's it gives it away so hard lmao||
here close up shot was 2d ye
https://twitter.com/dinoraye/status/1403022897564712967?s=19
apparently made an even more recent tweet about it eh
the creator of the show mentioned to be on the lookout for HGS news this summer
HGS has been such a shitshow
good article tho
I'm sure the originals brand isn't gonna go away yet.
thats first half of 86 done, pretty good
<:obama:461648244049707012>
i like the show for it (bcs it's basically Ikuhara lite and the show is done by a protegee of him) the biggest difference is that ikuhara treats his characters as characters and in the latter they're just tools to say it crudely.
its a lot of symbolism
probably laugh and reenact it
why wouldn't you tbh
akb0048 is better then LL s1 tbh
0048 is fun
<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
7 pretty lo
his pfp that is
it's the devil reicarnated
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
yeh from the side not really important group
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
just look at nova
important
remember
niji didn't really drop hard if you look at sales stuff
bit the drop happened at sunshine
it's still super popular
it has been tumbling down
s2 only really shows it at the end but they do sing
it's idol horses<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
also pretty different in general
the franchise isn't dying tho
no way out
just remember
the franchise started in 2010 but the anime around 2013 ye
Love Live school idol project
Love Live school idol project 2
Love Live school idol project the school idol movie

Love Live Sunshine
Love Live Sunshine 2
Love Live Sunshine the movie

niji something
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
sadly enough being a sakuga nerd also means you get to see the song uploads
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
i do like the MV style of things in the anime
you could have posted worse i guess
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
now that's wrong
<:nani:241228065357824001>
i didn't even say it was bad
well, i doubt it would be such a disappointment
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
rathee watch niji then watch the sunshine movie again
wanna hear something heretic nova?
<:china:256139699356172289>
ignoring the sunshine movie
s1 is the weakest entry though, keep that in mind idk
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
like the daughters
and yohanes and rikos moms
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
if you get to sunshine you get to see nana milf for like 5lines
lmao
though the moms are like 10s
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
i love that scene
what
<:15min:655058014495047690>
i wouldnt eat me <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

it's LL so all good
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
it's like that
and stella is honoka
we're nico
basically
<a:nopers:814840323720609822>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
is nico second to last then?
i can get behind that
oh thats fair
i'm already sweating
das a long essay
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
friendship over
def not watching niji now
wow
pls nova don't tell you have nico on a higher spot then last
so i guess there's that
everyones better then Nico
well
kotori better
she plays in revue as lead <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
yeah nozomi groping is one of the worst parts about s1
<:hinatahappy:813070375725301819>
s2 is peak tho and so is the movie
~~i dont actually like s1 all that much either~~
but she isnt like best best girl
well it wouldnt be muse without nico so sort of agree?
ew
depends on what exactly
<:15min:655058014495047690>
man this 10 dollar merch looks nice and its cheap
its a fucking rabbit hole that what it is
yes and no
>love live merc
>not expensive
the girls between the original conception with the first cds and magazines and s1 could mostly be different characters
its a remnant of the original idea's the yremoved iirc
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
they remove majority of her antics
yes
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
bad idea
LL quite literally got me out of depression
also good
either way it's a big dark and deep hole
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
but i dont remember who gave it to me
the kotori nendo i got gifted
yeah i just bought the whole box <:LUL:545650745534447631>
the mini nendos were 900 yen a piece
mini nendo's
not nendos
well mostly the costume was worse
the sunshine alter figs (birthday set) were such a disappointment compared to the muse ones <:LUL:545650745534447631>
https://puu.sh/HQsep.png
I'll let you do the math
could be the merch i actually bought already
could be worse
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
i better run
<:harold:595434251286085653>
not gacha whaling
for merch
how much money are you down the drain nova
<a:Lightevil:736675535563915275>
<:harold:595434251286085653>
why did i buy this 300 times
(tokui plays nico)
they're all played by tokui btw (the lil sisters and the lil bro)
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
you'll see
well star is close so heck ye
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
fast
ah
you're still on s1 ye?
that's fake news
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
muse already disbanded irl
<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
don't forget daddy emi bought an insane amount to support his daughter for rhe first cd single
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
LL is good tho
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
bad shows always get a sequel
the haifuri movie also aired unfinished but don't remember if they aired that back in theaters.
then had to re-air it in theaters when it was finished rofl
still can't believe it they actually aired the movie unfinished
the movie was the big production mess
the tv anime not really
<:pepegunR:708017743244558456>
ep 11 had to do that in 2 days
they have a week time? amazing
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
ye
futari is still one of the best precure tho
~~and here i thought AK was gonna post cubs~~
<:BikkiFacepalm:398808522952933377>
sounds like an easy 9 for me then <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
at least they actually said it was bcs of production issues
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
you can just jisho it either way <:15min:655058014495047690>
you should trust mtls with name tls either way
idolmaster soon
there's hololive also
yeah
just insert other cgi focused title here
<:G36snooze:734929862497927268>
https://puu.sh/HRlCh.pnghttps://puu.sh/HRlCh.png
the latter half are 13 eps only
eh like idk 400ish?
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
here's your order
Gintama (4 seasons or ep 1 till 201)
'

nah, i already have enough shows on my list 90% doesn't ever appear lmao
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
i have a separate account for hentai

rie

lmao i also have jin on 1 for staff
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
you guys need to watch more anime
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>

<:goldadamsmug:794718967390273557>
best genre
the main bulk is the first 4 seasons
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
<:Asahiclown:741811116082200616>
reminds me of the april fools joke they did last year
it's such a shitpost ending tho
oh I'm up to date dw
can drop it more now <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
based
haven't updated that for years tho
i liked ap for the achievements
or some staff/cast stuff bcs anilist is still worse at it
at most i use it for manga
never really use mal that much anymore for anime
<:Asahiclown:741811116082200616>
did mappa just pull a trigger
bcs i gave it a 10/10 for shitposting
i like how it shows the shitpost first

and this one is the hmm where did i get a job chart
it's pierrot for me but i also can't check lower bcs I'm not a donator
>studio's
there's also 4 movies but just watch them last instead of chronological order
i see the kirito
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
and I was gonna say now people can finally rest but mappa has 2 shows next season
probably ye
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
it was just otsuka saying something to generate hype when he said it really needed 3mins more tbh
welcome to nospiderday
friday deleted
check the credits ane you'll find out
or both
one day it's wholesome like the laura manatsu yuri pick that got posted here the other day
most of mine i follow on twitter so yeah
can't help it, precure artists have 2 sides
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
she has the best porn also
i love sango
i wish jc staff would think the same

<a:15min:490152208827154442>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
but i finished cub so all my energy is drained
<:confusedbasa:582396962112798720>
still got so much shows to catch up on
and Digimon also i guess lol
i should watch the last 5 eps of precure
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
and then you look at the artist his usual precure works
yes it is
gfl wasn't released in japan for years so the name was for grabs either way
why would it be illegal?
someone who spites the company
<:15min:655058014495047690>
someone trademarked girls frontline in jp so they couldnt use the name
so they couldn't use it
it was trademarked
jp doesnt use girls frontline
bcs thats the jp name
the mappa stream was going between 100k-150k viewers depending at the moment
the actual cuts might be in but edited to fit the episode and stuff or just wont be in it.
it is pre-animated yes
new original movie by ~~PA Works~~ Mappa
https://puu.sh/HS6mU.png
lmao
it also explains why higa hasn't been on the past few PA shows as art director
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
(It's done by the same people who did Maquia so Okada director/ Ishii as cd, cad, higashiji art director/ hiramatsu assistent director who worked for years at PA)
poor PA Works
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lEJToD1Ji8U
this hurts <:LUL:545650745534447631>
there's also this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mb0k1HLm3Ls
<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
pre animated pvs's
macross music evolves with its time
yeh <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
TG1 even has kawamori as mech design and oobari as ad/ka etc
yeh
depends on the entry
its toei so yes?
good old transformers was also 80s heh
which was eh 1972
the earliest show i'v seen was gatchaman
(not Z, original DB)
like dragon ball is from the 80s
i just watched them
i wasnt born either heh
i've seen some 80s i guess
thats touhou so a game (or fanmade anime)
<:15min:655058014495047690>
>expecting something from tnk
idk
define shitty animation
you know
its just straight up hentai in PP
he isnt but he also keeps pretenses with his other works although all of them has sex
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
surely PP also can
if worlds end harem can get an anime
at least lynn dropped all of the pretenses and made it pure hentai
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
well hot it is
wouldnt be over half of the anime
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yeah bcs who adapts something that's still running
i would question that for a lot of shows <:LUL:545650745534447631>
no u
that's bcs japan considers anything with iron, mecha  <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
you could very well count it as such
it has mechs
but eh it's just pulling straws
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
the west would actually consider robots mecha
ikxi with the enlightement
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
movie studio's are a different ballpark
you can probably count the amount of anime with good schedules on your fingers
<:harold:595434251286085653>
imagine having time with over 200 shows a year
while true, that apparently doesn't exist in anime production
say 1 studio that has management like kyoani <:15min:655058014495047690>
an anime airing this season from cloverworks
nothing to do when it wasn't storyboarded yet
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
they keep going out of stock
yeah, bd1 is up to ~200k rn or something like that
:^)
yeh
both have anime
pripara is prism Paradise, sequel to Pretty Rythm arcade games
different
^the director tweeted a bit earlier he can finally go to sleep so you can take a guess.
wep is 45mins and half of it is recap btw
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/encyclopedia/people.php?id=110 btw
all of the old farts are pretty bad
they'll just give it to someone like yoshida to write it out
at least in case of kyoani they have directors that can pitch idea's
kyoani doesn't have writers either
they're freelance
yeah but >anime studio's
>writers
(for an earlier reply) usually you just don't really see the cracks in a production unless things either go really bad or your project is really fucking ambitious (and WEP is both)
key animation
well not if the studio isnt on the committee for the original
all it needed was someone to tell folks to reign in the ambitition and a better idea on how to pace eps.
i disagree, making it 2 cour wouldn't just make it better.
nice
(the less the better)
at the end of a season like ~4-5
~1-2
some eps had 20+
on average
yes
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
you wre close
animation directors
~~ZLS had a worse production but MAPPA putting ~17 ADs on average every ep saved them~~
just remember the first 7 eps and not the final one <a:15min:490152208827154442>
or they could give him a chief director to tell him when too much is too much
he's way too ambitious for tv-anime
just give wakabayashi a movie or something
and move on to the next project
just bd fixes and they'll be done with it
doubt it
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
it feels more like just another ep instead of a finale

<:LUL:545650745534447631>
although it took gohands idk 5+ years and a rabid fandom to get them cancelled for plagiarism
more then enough to fuck things up
for a while
they did though
good
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
new work for that maybe god knows
maybe
expelled in paradise
nah
gurobutcher also working on a new anime
theatrical will be later tbh
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
eva 3+1 on amazon prime in august
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
and then shits on the main cast by have the spinoff cast do dumb shit
not everyone is ritz who intertwines every fucking spinoff  char with the main series cast
<:15min:655058014495047690>
and doesnt matter for the main
thats why its a spinoff
last set of ova's is gonna finish of all of the 22 volumes
yeah they adapt every arc in an ova of 3-4 eps
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
strike the blood looking at all of these LN's never getting sequels or full adaptations
<:15min:655058014495047690>
the whole show is bad
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
but she wants to know whats the difference
at least char wise
the ln is fairly different
what does that have to do with s1 s2 s3 though
~~and index~~
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i can't believe you rave on sns with fucked up adaptation when zero no tsukaima exists
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
nobody cares but you cypher
those tend to be the worst "adaptations"
anime doesnt have to follow shit 1:1
i dont care if its not in the ln, it was fun
it was fun
who cares
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
stop comparing it to the source so much
its also the best season
<:15min:666327834079264786>
the writer has the right idea in his heart but the wrong idea in his head
eh how do you say it
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
just don't watch the special (finale ep)
first half of ep 2 is pretty <:JustFine:597629265147723777>

<:KEK:739953921895694417>
watch sonny boy <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
i wasnt planning to watch anime today but new season had other plans

but eh not like ngnl s2 is happening
i guess they could grab the director
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
it's the antartica staff which means it's the ngnl staff
this means no ngnl <:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
the sister and the nun
I'm not dino that has a billion
Ikkitousen, Freezing (gift), Strike Witches, Nisemonogatari, Dog Days, Haganai, FGO, Angel Beats, some original char
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
when she's in my room
the cat uses it to sleep now
maybe if it didnt feel like a bad vocaloid take i would agree
i like the music but the vocals are not fitting
youtousei: exactly as i imagined it would be
kageki shoujo: pretty nice first ep

but you posted the figure link <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
||~~also lmao it being half of the spider ~~||
ah it's the leds
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
```
The spider head can be made into a set with "Miraito (released by: Hiromu Sangyou)" (sold separately).```
ye
<:15min:655058014495047690>
its a soft reboot bcs its a new school
with new girls
just another entry in the series
its like Sunshine
keke best girl confirmed
but they're all the same <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
instead of having someone adapt his og designs for the girls
i do like him but it would have been refreshing to see more of a new look
<:harold:595434251286085653>
the char designer is different but it still looks so much like the og char designs (murota)
og writer also
he is
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
my wallet
havent actually read any of the descriptions besides names
she sure looked like one on the promo video
so you have a thing for school prez <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
surely it will change when the anime actually airs, hard to guess best girl with just small talk segments eh

~~kuku keke~~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BO0sg03p6G4
with her accent tick
or hanamura
more like ruby
https://puu.sh/HTVEI.png
keke is best girl
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
and they are still in the gacha
muse has been dead for years
(yet)
they're not even in the gacha
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
they're people?
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
they have goldship for gags, dont need the trainer
he's just annoying in s1
trainer is fine in s2 at least
the shift between seasons is fun at least, s1 is more focused on the (annoying) trainer and the races while s2 is more of a character drama that happens in a sports show
~~s2 has even better chemistry tho~~
yeah
jbis is gonna spoil every single race
i wouldnt really look at them
eh
MHA at least puts a different team on the movies for the most part
where they're just another tv-anime episode animated instead of actually being movie quality
welcome to the tv-anime movies thing <a:15min:490152208827154442>
it's also on kyoanis youtube channel iirc
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
reminder that best nagi girl is Miuna
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
i hope its like nagi and full of ||ntr||
PA pls
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
https://puu.sh/HUPFA.png
lmao
they can use kimetsu money to pay it off <:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
it's not like they're even gonna blink at it tbh
it's just how much they have to pay from kondo getting caught in 3018
the tax evading is still the same one as last time
but i like it
it gets really bad in the second half with hard scifi gobbledygook
it's not even bad early on
like wep
yeah but what if the original has no ending
even if they did equally bad
its still easier to pitch a sequel for a ln then an original anime
you cant just compare an adaptation with an original
it's different
where you would at least expect the show to have an ending
unlike an original
bcs its a ln so its expected
and wep falls in the latter
<:15min:655058014495047690>
a series having a shit ending is still better then a series with no ending
there's always exceptions <:15min:655058014495047690>
godzilla SP also did it but at least that one was better <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
~~stop hiring live action script writers for anime~~
yeah raws came out like 2ish hours ago
fuck you 2 funi
eh fuck Superstar is latecast
ep 2 was yesterday
it already started cyph
<a:Painom:765566348172460042>

it's dumb but thats nhk for you
it's a song that streams after the anime
it's not a song that's in the anime
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
tuesday
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
imagine not watching anime of the season
||she failed on stage on ep 1 as a kid||, thats already more progress then any LL mc
i mean
until the subs are out lol
so i could watch with line vid
i should chec kif they're airing it on line again like the others
well i sleep till monday/tuesday
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
go back to your LL emoji's
yes
<:15min:655058014495047690>
reviewers is also a pretty good show unlike kaifuku
what kind of essay are you typing
just saying there's a big difference in a show like kaifuku/reviewers or a show like to love ru in terms of the content for fanservice
<:crybikkicry:688937203434258462>
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
smart person summed up fanservice
<:dumbass:519540159184633866>
<:REEE:333956827182137345>
you missing the point
noooo
(or smut)
its called borderline H
i might actually have to go for onibe bcs fucking funi still hasnt released the ep
keke is besto
they're not gonna read them if they want the gay and not the hetero
its gonna build on the experiences
well you should for s3
yeah and then they actually had to write that in <:LUL:545650745534447631>
well kyoani went out of their way to make it more gay and remove the bf
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
and here i was ignoring that comment ash
<:15min:655058014495047690>
hard to do when she (sasara)actually gets a ||bf||
if you're watching it for the gay you should just stop watching
same like i said about kageki
<:15min:655058014495047690>
and i dont want people to be disappointed
and nagi was the opposite of that
people are watching it bcs it looks gay
which means love triangle
it still feels like the second coming of nagi to me
i still dont trust aquatope
same
its just tools with a basic personality
revue didnt even had characters <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
it's revue but without the supernatural
i like stage plays
i am
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
bcs if they do i have bad news for you
<:harold:595434251286085653>
i just hope people aren't watching kageki shoujo and think it's yuri
<:REEE:333956827182137345>
s3 when
ans speaking of sangatsu
i should go watch FB now that its finished
if puush wants to load that is
chihaya is part of this list for me
https://puu.sh/HVTgU.png
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
but first let me finish s3
that would be nice
86 is a prime example of actually how to do adaptations
yeah but ritz is wanking to achiga so no anime for anything
you're never getting more saki until ritz gets out of his achiga wanker
and pluto is gonna be the same probably
it's a good show ofc, just fails hard at the adaptation part
i think i said enough how bad monster is as an adaptation bcs it's panel for panel
same same
not really related to the anime
well the short is just a commercial
same
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
that said, amagi brilliant park s2 when (never)
the movie was good (the not recap one)
They make good shit but you aint gonna watch it for proper adaptations of their own imprints.
stuff from other publishers are a tad safer on that regard.
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
Free author actually left their KA esuma imprint for it
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
never forget that best chuunibyou characters are anime original and that Rikka basically stole pink girls personality so s2 into s1 doesnt make any sense
the movies are just closer to the lns
they did their own thing with the tv series
chuunibyou 2 was bad bcs s1 fucked over the whole novel
reminder that chuunibyou s2 is the first light novel
adapt fairly loosely
as per kyoani tradition
it's like ????
and then they renamed it season 0 in 2019 and the author  started kageki again from scratch
kageki is like 15chapters on the original manga
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
the new characters gonna carry s3 np
who knows which ones they're even gonna adapt
there's 2 versions
well isn't that like an old one
<:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
>anime licenses go into the millions (even bad ones lol)
>thinks you can license for 100k
<:Kanon:715857789884432436>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
grznted they have like 500 emojis
did they finally add some
and about time official is out
dun see any on the LL reddit discord and its emoji serverd
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
stage plays are fun
https://youtu.be/DxFCZT31_4E
mob anime takes big liberties anyway so they could get away with one to wrap the series up
wouldnt surprise me if they just wrap it up with a movie tbf
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
the fourth stage play
they're just baiting
yeah i did
🥦
i wish

https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E6NX9oYWUAY_EVF?format=jpg
and by that i mean
it has everything you would ever need from precure
yeah its extremely good
well it's an ueno movie so i'm not gonna complain regardless <:LUL:545650745534447631>
well so far a good show and one of the best precure shows together? sign me up
every precure happens at the same time canonically in huggto
but huggto was also the just crossover everything season
havbent seen it yet
or eh for movie itself
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
the team can hardly handle a full season nowadays and they keep giving them 2 movies a year to handle also
well precure is on the backburner so doubt it
crossover has been a staple since like early on tbh
well hard to care about the 3 others so far <:LUL:545650745534447631>
same
which is interesting in it's own
bar only having to deal with 5 girls this time around
superstars is made by basically the original LL staff in the first place tbh
which original LL is also full off
the directing? yeah it's sort of his style with all of the comedic timing
had a pretty similar vibe to his original LL directing
his quirks are so noticeable <:LUL:545650745534447631>
finished superstar
welcome back Kyougoku <:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
could you ask for her reasoning?
basically what lanks said
so its just a strange order to do
yes but its not meant to be watched before tbh
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
yeh but I'm long past the make your list looking fancy stage tbh
you need to read grimgar and more Muv-Luv
you don't have time for that
i stopped at 14ish
i havent read them yet
not sure about 14++ tho
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
it expands on 14 but it also includes the short novella's the author released for the anime bd bonuses
iirc it's just weird stuff
its the anime
https://j-novel.club/series/grimar-of-fantasy-and-ash
its like 14, 14+, 14++, 15
there's actually 20
if you're premium
17
👀
actually trash
kageki had a much better opening ep
eh aquatope was nice but nowhere amazing
https://twitter.com/konosubaanime/status/1416746565700440071
also new konosuba project for people who like that
well i dont agree with you so <:LUL:545650745534447631>
ehm it was easily the best premiere this season <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
sonny boy is good
<:harold:595434251286085653>
im gonna wait on all 6 pripri movies
y
kanon also pretty good
keke is way too good, she shouldnt be allowed to exist
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
<@!199928870810419200> i think i might love LLS
keke truly is my spirit animal
ye
the action is just a bonus
i like the talking more anyway
should be some good action if they don't goof up
gonna be better when we're past all the talking at least
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
they're at least not stretching out the nothing happens scenes like rezero 2<a:15min:490152208827154442>
the key visual is eh a thing at least
the first 11 minutes look interesting
tbf majority of the companies aren't gonna sell their og prints
so they're probably just gonna give it to that fan and keep their own copy i guess
nothing bcs that whole thing is illegal anyway
i mean they have all rights to do that
just rendered in cgi and no bg
fairly sure its the exact same scene from the broly movie
it's just a teaser
nice cgi but lol
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
there's plenty of content where its only miyuki and co without any sort of tatsuya but thats not something we're ever gonna see
yeah esp not with the content they're adapting rn
:^)
only 3 letters
just use their old name
dont
lives
ep2 is what really sold me on keke
yes <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
mostly so for idol anime but also for a lot of other school anime
||the director telling the school president she can't block them from making a club||
you know what actually was a breath of fresh air?
her ep 2 is <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
👀

keke
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
chinese/japanese
so is her va
keke is chinese
they wont even let funi stream the eps
i wish but it's nhk <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
unless nhk magically allows other stations to actually air the eps
you're gonna have to wait until end of august to even watch ep 3
dont bother ash
that's what the spinoff is for tbf
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
real chads just read the ln
well isekai (genre) is a western coined term so eh no idea honestly
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
you can read my messages so i assume
~~just read it~~
that's easy to say though
progressive actually replaces sao but sure
what
he started writing sao from scratch
but that's exactly what he's doing tbf?
that's aoi yuki yes
sao hasn't been about sao since v1
progressive is reki just rebooting sao
it's a reboot
unless they adapt moon cradle
well reki has to finish said arc first
ordinal scale exists ye
the movie used a different style and its been like that since
after s2
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
s1
sao would have been better if they kept the old style <a:15min:490152208827154442>

unlike sol
it's not actually something i would watch nowadays
i don't think i would have finished index either in current time

manabi straight is just ufo at it's best without the use of an insane amount of filters
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
not really
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
https://youtu.be/dUof1mcwkrM
still better then any recent ufotable show
the you know what ep is better tbf
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
<:hinatahappy:813070375725301819>
troll op better
the troll op made it better tho
i liked s7<:harold:595434251286085653>
that ones denied

"absorption-type company split,"

the term for what they actually did
"new" is pretty relative (KAI is just Gonzo, they have the same president and the same building address)
tho mcqueen the best
i like all of them
the dvds/bds are in chronological order
yes
ash be like , i wont understand <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
every show has a bonus for gacha or live events or both nowadays so that points kinda moot.
lmao
but i get they wouldn't want to blame it on their poor scheduling causing s2 to get delayed so just naming it s3 is gonna be easier on regular folks <:15min:655058014495047690>
its literally gonna be ep 9-12/13
the subtitle is dumb
tfw only 8 episodes
always time to swap
homura
wada <:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
either tamers or adventures best, depends on your mileage
dont really mind spoilers anyway
dw
its ost
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
just let me eh finish s3
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
still gonna have a lot of talking tho
but yeah it will get a bit more actiony
spice and wolf
or you know
or log horizon
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
for slime
but i can see ash his point
lol i would be fine with just 12 eps of exposition and stuff
^and just ||teleported the troops||
you had a ||punch||
<a:JeanneCheer:621818714152501292>
she's a good project lead/tl lead but just don't give her a show <:harold:595434251286085653>
if there's a truly bad tl of sentai there's like 90% it's her

~~and how generic the trailer is overall~~
every time i see/watch the gfl trailer it reminds me how pretty meh the anime designs are.

anime is not real after all
well thats a fair statement
there's always the not so good clannad movie that deals with the ending differently
the anime is good but does a terrible job at ||the lights||
thats usually the case for clannad AS
they're going for the manga design though which is inferior <:LUL:545650745534447631>

he's a bit more darkish green in the ln
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
yeah i dont remember ponta being described as being such green in the ln
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
its from the prequel
that doesn't change what i said
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
so he's a lost cause and a workaholic
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
he's a lost cause
he's not a madman
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456> <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
just skip the first 12 eps
Girly Air Force eh
yes
nana wills it
muv luv cameo in remake this ep
https://twitter.com/AnimeRecorder/status/1423999870050963457
3 is kind of whatever tbh
2 is fun, has best henshin scene in the show
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
i should rewatch me 2
very nice
the anime is only a droplet
<:15min:655058014495047690>
the only problem with the yuyuyu franchise is everything canon and 90% of it isnt available in the west legally
washio just builds up tougou tbh
but also one of the slowest to change it to 1080p/2k
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
for all the flack we give them, JC staff was one of the first to adapt higher res shows
Trigger is still 480p with background elements on 1080p
iski is talking about the native res of the show
its not about who watched in 720p
depending the studio ofc
yes they have
yes
at the very least it's not netflix jail
same man
the sequel got canned
ex arm was already over
yeh that's fair <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
it's worse then before
they're splitcouring bcs the production went to hell
ye indeed
the complaint is valid tbf, usually they fall back to a more balanced spotlight but sometimes it's on midseason cure too much (see healing good)
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
looks at every precure when mid season cure gets revealed
truly magical
lol
finishing bocchi eh
yes
tbf it's very natural to go from AD to director
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
really good casting choice if i say so myself
i did enjoy it
yes

idk if the world is ready for the ||skeleton|| aya
it's already enjoyable for me
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
there will just be fighting in the background
every ep
probably towards the final eps ye
bcs the ln exists <a:15min:490152208827154442>
no
although im sure i'll end up reading bits and pieces of the ln before the second season comes out
yeah
life shouldn't be any else

eva 4.0 is up on amazon prime (and nyaa), time to avoid spoilers till I can watch it tomorrow afternoon
and in the case miura did leave an outline then i would actually be fine with it getting a few more chapters
i dont actually think its gonna continue tbf, looks more to me his assistants are gonna finish this chapter as a tribute
he prepped his assistants for this reason
i don't think that's right
slower pace are better then faster paced ones tbh
very good day <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
i didn't get past like ep 5 of logos
me and lanks actually disagree on a lot of anime stuff tbh
i don't agree with that at all? majority of the dyna cast had strong characterizations?
eh had disagree
dyna actually had a cast unlike gridman
eh
gridman was just the akane show
dyna hzd the morr interesting characters imo
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
it is
sure looked a bit more moe <:15min:655058014495047690>
if you can get past the meme ratings sure
wouldnt do that
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
(and tbf golden time never really grew on me unlike toradora)
bold of you to assume i had brain cells left when that show aired
strongest was amusing tho
nein
medaka was just dropped bcs i didnt had the time after stalling it for years and then in the end i went for the manga instead
||ghost banri|| was super annoying
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

watch Dogeza de Tanondemita , ayaya
(most are genuine rated on personal enjoyment)
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
bcs people look at lists, see how much you rated them and might give them a try
through the api, ash
both are awful anyway for what i would want to use them for <:15min:655058014495047690>
but yeah anilist is my go to anyway now
you still cant do most of the shit on the new mal api compared to the old one
at least the current functionality available on the api
it's good
they have a new api though
it was down for close to a year
and then come back with minimal support <:LUL:545650745534447631>
thats what happens when your fucking site is dead for a year
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
then you'll have a second one bcs of the latesub

all of the author lns are isekai shitposts tbh
im pretty indifferent about it <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
same when its on nyaa
most of the good shit have been in the movies tbh
its anime so who knows
which theoretically should be a tad better then some of the prev arcs animated but like
its the villain academia arc
not like the berserk movies are that much better tbh
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
still not good but better
the bd is a lot better though

animation wise

heh
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
and you had anime
all they had to do was take the vn and remove the song loops
granted the vn was anime in the first place?
school days is a good vn adaptation <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so i guess it counts
but it got adapted well
not that the vn is that good
koi to chocolate is also a good adaptation of the vn but like
still a bad adaptation
still better then CH though
and a bad adaptation
but RN is vn
occultic; something
or whatever it was called
you're thinking of O;N
yes
no
none at all <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

there's no good ML anime and this one won't be any different
there's no filtering or anything its just cgi mobs on a painted background
https://puu.sh/I6qmV.jpg
they dont even exist on the same plane
the shots at the end look better
<:pain:848226587006468177>
https://puu.sh/I6qmx.png
how well as in?
with a whole bunch having lasting effects on your playthrough and story choices
Matsushita has like an average of ~200 choices
its also like super fucking long?
nd only 1 is released
and theres 6 parts total for the vn ™
so it doesnt even have the anime ending yet
it adapts like ep 1-11 sort of
sort of
i never fully finished part 1 bcs there's so many character routes to go through
and helps a lot for their char growth they never had in the show
they're actually giving every char its own route
it actually is
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
just like angel beats part 2 vn is never gonna be released
i still want full tomoyo after ova but thats never happening
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
so you could just watch the not so good anime versions of them
most are the same platonic shit tho
some are worse
some are better
there's like 20 <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
which one
its just oshirabu for new ones lmao
i havent actually played that much new ones, im still just replaying my old vns
back in the day we had full animated vns ~~i mean school days~~
at least nowadays they have  live2d to spice it up a bit <a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
or for 100% completion
yeah thats fine
``` playing this game with a guide that dictates all the choices you make completely defeats the purpose of its design. This is a game that was made with experimentation and chaos in mind; half the fun is seeing just how far it lets you push the more out-there options.```

bcs im too lazy to type it myself
using a guide ruins the game though
they do stuff with chars
just wish they actually gave any indication if the other parts are delayed or just cancelled
i like the vn a lot
the vn gives its character to time to breath
y
worst adaption for key vns is probably rewrite
true route
refrain is better adapted
yes
no
that doesnt make it any easier <:LUL:545650745534447631>

it's just phases that come and go

yes
as long as it's fun to watch  I'll be content.
not that a month is that much of a buffer but its better then having none.
on the "plus" side, 6 eps are mostly finished and editing on 7 is started so they at least have a small leeway
there's still a difference
science saru is trash (behind the scenes)

a fun you know thing, animegataris is the show with the fastest production cycle. It went from planning stage to airing on tv in 6 months. (gen production cycle starts a good 2 years before broadcast)
it's basically a parody full of meta stuff about anime creation
was fine
i did

cr and funinare just hacks with shitty encoder settings. Funi actually manages to look worse with higher filesize.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
AoD is also fairly big filesize but it actually looks good
its amazing how incompetent both players are lmao
1080p ^:)
and then there's funi with their new encoding settings which even manages to not give enough bitrate to a panning image. It also looks pretty amazing
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496650964384743434/864637051596570634/4xcqBvs.png
iirc for CR it used to be VBR with decent caps but on the new encode settings they use crf (but with bitrate caps) so action/dark scenes dont get enough bitrate and regular scenes get too much bitrate for whats required so while the quality more or less looks the same, the filesize did double.
funi changed their encoding last year
they changed itna few years back and people called them out on it
<:harold:595434251286085653>
money doesnt exactly solve your i dont have enough time issue
i honestly dont think budget wouldnt do anything
stagnate it a bit and make less isekai per season (and in a year) then maybe they wont look all the same
at least not 5 in a season
rather not
the term didnt exist back then though
yes cocoa
pls
arent we all
to differentiate
they'll use it in titles but the word is mainly a western coined term
you'll find them under the fantasy tag
japan doesnt even use isekai like we do
isekai is a subgenre of fantasy lmao
just call it fantasy lmao
go ahead

there's stuff coming involving him but who knows if the anime ever gets there
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
well he still didnt die in the LN iirc so gl with that
~~bcs its the first book listed~~
i mean cant help it, the cover is that
https://www.thriftbooks.com/series/street-fighter-comics/44380/
yes
the SF manga? lol
so SF
although it also appears in bayonetta but i dont think it would be that
street fighter ye
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
extremely veldora
it was fun

proper credits 2
the first part is
the later part
today in dragon ball Z, I eh mean slime.

<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
dont have to animate the hardest part of a show if you don't add it to the show
and idaten
yes?
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
or make a show about water polo that had not even 5mins of water polo
or you be like mappa so you hire 100 peeps per show to even get it moving
you just added 40 people for no reason
so more worse things slip through so the show would look bad regardless
you could argue with more budget then can hire more people but that means a certain set of people will need to check more in the same time so they would actually have less time to properly check everything.
aya pls
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
sugoi generally is correct though
could be real, could be not. We'll know for certain when it gets (or not) announced at the japanside of things
(there is a website trademarked for it months ago)
bless yamada
twas good ep
also gonna watch that but its a short so
oh yeh the key short
true
86 p2
JoJo
Kyoukai Senki
Lupin 3: p6
Muv-Luv
Pride of Orange
Selection Project
YuYuYu s3

maybe digimon ghost game and denchi shoujo
imagine being able to watch a movie
tis a restart
nope
its original content
<:okay:330354891727962122>
which were actually awesome to see the cures back in a not all stars movie
all hugtto had for anniv stuff was the crossover eps
bcs its anniv season
star twinkle is the season where they went retro designs
star twinkle is the anniv season btw
he's talking about the literal final btw
i see suffering
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
maybe i should catch up
yup
i know what im watching tomorrow if i dont feel a sick as today
~~they're the same thing~~
yes that happens a lot
good thing they usually dont do sequels
also worst precure eh, probably Yes Pretty Cure Five Go! Go!?
(the other actual sequel seasons is also meh)
just to fuck with bandai
yeah so she's ambiguous <:LUL:545650745534447631>
(they're not allowed to do green)
but she's also basically a fuck you to bandai and the likes
lala is fun
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
star twinkle is also amazing tbf
which is by far the worst precure of like the past 6 or so seasons
but like its miles better then healin good
i think the series is quite good, it ofc has its flaws
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
also you wouldnt think the ending is infamous though seeing as every precure artist is drawing the adult versions based on the final ep
ye
well canonically every precure happens at the same time thanks to hugtto<:15min:655058014495047690>
but its pretty ballsy and thats why i think the show might be infamous?
as far as you can take a kids series that is
hugtto deals with suicide, transgender, etc
and deals with actual issues
the whole series is also fairly strong
its just required for the content that follows
the movie is just following the novels (unlike the anime)
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/E_exW0eUYAId2Oa?format=jpg&name=large
look like shinkalion is doing another eva crossover ep <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
||no||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tt4vjKw2KNk
they uploaded short cm for it on youtube 2
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
its okay, the show will melt so hard nobody will be able to tell if they're standing correctly or not
lmao neco, i was gonna mention that
the movie is amazing though
tamako market was also in a pretty awkward spot not knowing what it wanted to be
and also add 3 original characters in s1
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
and then insert her back in s2
which is a hard problem to solve when you remove the lead character
most of it stems from s1 existing
ye
but then they butchered the actual ln lead char so hard i can't like s2 at all
i want to like it but like all of the original content is great
and regarding chuunibyou I'm on the fence tbh
mofu came right after munto at least
well they never did fmp so they shouldn't be credited for the first season?
which technically was also their first show
first kyoani was munto for me
<:harold:595434251286085653>
same
imagine forgetting the baseball ep
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
anime original
while also adding a whole bunch of routes
it ends somewhere around ep 10 of the anime
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
if only they released more parts for it like they planned
y
no nothing
let me undie first
not like merch is the only indicator ever
should be the volume after so like ||3 big fights||
also kind of sucks, might be a pain to be able to watch it
slime movie in fall 2022 <@!238855496797257729> <@!171395487247630336>
it's different

<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
a good tv can do that 2, aya
no idea what my last us bd purchase was but after this shower I'll check my most recent jp bds
well bds, think dvds are different
then you share region with japan
this easier if you live in the US
still need to hunt down a region free bd player but those are costly
i have a bd drive in my pc so I'm not one to talk anyway
it's the same drive<:harold:595434251286085653>
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
be it Xbox or ps
and almost every household has a console
people just use consoles
<a:aMariwhale:397936255632932875>
sony was the only publisher that sold their shows to virtually every licensor possible
sony did before they bought out everyone
so a show that did shit on every aspect but did well for streaming internationally can still get a sequel
selling stream licenses to foreign countries brings in more money then anything they sell inside japan lmao
except they do?
kobayashi: and then they married ||not||
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
tsubasa the anime
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
the only awful thing is that they put 10volumes in a single ova so they could finish the story
the show was fun tbh

i wouldnt mind k x f though
they've been hinting hard at k x k
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>

its okay kukru and kai will go out
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
<:painpeko:856324872913682473>
well the pv for the second half is also up and you see ||fuuka leaving in a plane|| so yeah
poor fuuka
thinking real hard about the new kv for the show
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/257949392940695562/890628315176632360/20210923_165828.jpg

<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
or well its anime main character disease
cs she's dumb*
hard to do that when she runs to fuuka instead of kai lmao
he's been there for her more then fuuka ever has
bcs kukuru is dumb and doesnt see what kai is doing
and i honestly dont care what it ends up being
either way they have both set up to go either fuuka or kai
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so baiting but actually straight in the end
im just going by previous pa works shows
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
the k x k is still alive
can't wait for jc staff to butcher up s2 like how they butchered up Mewkledreamy Mix! (s2) after s1 of that being so good.
yes
its worse then og madoka airing
everything past ep 5 is broken and shouldnt have been on the screen
storywise yeah and the first 5 eps
its a dumpster fire past ep 5
yes
magireco literally aired with broken sequences and unfinished va work
it was complete animationwise at least
i'll take a mix but when you're literally airing unfinished episodes you should just call it quits
at least they still managed to crap out episodes unlike magireco <:15min:655058014495047690>
s5 still better then 4 so far but im not up to date
<:15min:655058014495047690>
its okay s6 already greenlit <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:harold:595434251286085653>
the live action part of cup was more interesting then the anime part
good idea, i shall join you
<a:aMariwhale:397936255632932875>
also keep in mind names have to be approved by jp side 2 so it could also just be a case of jp side thinking it fits better then anne-sophia
<:whomstve:423625706648371210>
last weeks ep prolly had the best sakuga ep this season
<a:aWorryNinja:771065617322344500>
maybe after i catch up with precure
heard it ended pretty well
i should finish kageki
that's lowballing it <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
~~when we really shouldnt even be getting 40 a year total instead of the 200+ we get now~~
the industry is so broken rn and kadokawa still wants to push 40+ shows a year
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
some just mask it better then others
its basically that for every show the past year and a half
<a:BonkCat:684146912298926101>
they delayed witches for this
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it crashed and burned harder then wep (production wise) which i would say is hard but its shaft so its not i guess
onisama in december
oh lanks
im gonna disagree on anything past ep 5
there's a scene where they're talking to each other but its missing the voicelines
:^)
just watch magireco s2 ep 6
cs those generally are done even on storyboards in the worst case
you cna have unfinished eps but when the va work isnt done yet you have serious problems
is all im saying
they should have taken the loss and delay the rest of the show till december 2
from your magireco posts
yes i can notice
you're watching
you're not reading a book
wrong
its anime. both are equally important
tututu
(the eps i watched)
the first 5 eps are still better then all of mha s5 combined tho
i'll take a shitty shounen thats at least functional above that
>delay the show
>delay the second half of the season to december and call it s3
>only need to do 8 eps, still manages to put in a delay, air outright unfinished episodes
:^)
just anime in general
nice
that's amazing

from the prescreening apparently
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
ep 1 is original story about Sadogashima defence
ep 2 is takeru meeting meiya
first ep is original 2
<:15min:655058014495047690>
why not both
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
i mean we have 13 eps (unless split cour)
<:LUL:545650745534447631>

welcome to month ago
which i assume will be used for editing purposes anyway
70 cuts so barely anything
you could probably go ep 1, skip till ep 7, start ep 8
well the first 7 eps are recap
70 cuts is like a few minutes tops so don't expect much new stuff
something like first ep is fully original to bridge s1 and s2 (train arc) and a whole new 70 cuts
very true

at least you don't need to remember their names, not like they'll show up again
same although they shouldn't really have spend 2 eps on it so idk if they could have slowed it down even more
the real meat is starting next week anyway
expected worse though
~~i love ml~~
now that i finished the ep completely for muv luv, action fairly good, beta still have too much gloss (the cgi effect) but anything not action took a pretty cliff down and looked pretty bad. last 5 seconds of the episode hype tho
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
they pulled the same trick on total eclipse anime too
its just the defense of sdadsasdasd
its not even related to alternative
its just fluff

yeah bcs >original content
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
https://puu.sh/IgxH4.png
its not like they dont have other things they should be doing
its cool to see it but eh
eh dun think that matters that much when its just filler
besides not actually mattering and only have 1? eps lmao
well not much to fuck up with an original ep
🍿
worst best show this season
oh did the sub finally come out
which i guess is cool
everyone has new voice actors besides norio
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
stays amazing
still the audacity to keep norio and replace everyone else for the cast
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
god i hope it's split cour
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>

the show might actually have been better off if they want 12 eps original
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
there's no good muv luv anime
yeh it will be so bad they're either never gonna see how good the show actually is or just call it trash
it's not
you do
gonna be real clown hours if they're gonna do something stupid like flashbacks to make it remotely have any sense
that still doesn't solve the prev required vns not being adapted
<:YuriShrug:799671394114732032>
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
and no amount of eps they give the show will ever make it good
they're adapting something that misses a lot of context
in the first place
or they wouldn't have started with original content or alternative
it's clearly not for fans
they wouldn't care
fans have been waiting for 20 years
so mecha fans left who just want to see robots in action?
you could say new people but then those get fucked from next ep onwards anyway
long time ML fans already know the threat og the Beta
who are they targetting even
it's an ep that didn't need to exist
ML has no good anime <a:15min:490152208827154442>
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
but hey even if muv luv gonna suck ass (80% sure it will)  this still gonna be mech porn so I'm totally in
it's dumb but w/e
yeh
so i haven't
i should watch the newest one but its like 2 eps once every few months

yes
ofc they're gonna look like bandori when it's the same designer
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
craft egg is the designer
yes
then it would have ended pretty okay but after that it just drags on
honestly maybe if it was 13 eps i would have watched it
it is shounen lol but like

this is wild
these were supposed to be for 2020 too lmao

if it was prod issues they would have said something else
to jan 22 that is, rrason cited is the prod. com. taking a closer look at the episodes produced. (ie too horny)
lmao world end harem is delayed already
"mostly good" but ||"doing non-consent things"|| isnt what i eh yeah

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
im up to date with PP and i really cant agree
idk about that
its prolly the worst one
rinne was bad anyway so not like not shilling would have saved the show
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
they're just skipping that part
that is actually muv luv too
are people really gonna invest time in a vn where the anime sucked ass
everyone basically agrees it was a bad way to start if it isnt at least 24 eps(split)
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
this pretty good
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>

probably
yes

12min anime, 12min live action
its 50/50

can't go wrong by naming a character Balzac too
but the twist? was fun?
well if you like chibi mechs or not
i liked it

it had a good enough ending
just different start and condensed everything else
the movie is the same as the series
all of the star driver inserts rock

same
looks like a yes

Although would have been funnier if he used his circle name instead
nice to see based monogatari anime artist embracing his roots again <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
it's that but chibis and gleipnir sort of now that lanks mentions it
you watched star driver aya?
yes but no

welcome to mappa ep
aaah
assuming both funi and cr will be on vrv again now that funi also has that
wouldn't vrv be a better option then?
<:Wakaru:834568786383994881>
it's just more grating compared to your usual dubs bcs meh songs
not gonna disagree
also >LL dubbed
idk if they would get the dub then too though
probably why cr never got the dub after the split
the dub came out during the cr funi thing and funi had the dubs on their platform them
that's just funi
it's usually like 5 years minimum
yeh
it didn't expire yet?
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
LL expired
F
movie too for nnb
but why?
didnt really look at last weeks credits but CR actually funded the anime
the ep wasnt bad but gonna have to get used to the new va's for a bit
this isn't my muv-luv <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>

my watch list are shows from 2018 till 2021 current season lol
cute
aya pls

they made a tweet somewhere eh
author is cool too, basically replies on any language with deepl <:LUL:545650745534447631>
~~it's also basically mushoku but without the pedo angle etc~~
could have been just regular fantasy
i agree with point 2 pretty hard
prolly
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
but it has all the cute girls
time to spend that time watching 86 so you have something on saturdays
~~more like god bless dandelion animation studios for the cgi~~
the cgi was also darn impressive
yeh but honestly idm
good show too
it's kinda steampunk mecha ish
that's where yoppi cut her hair
are the movies not available legally?
https://twitter.com/avexpictures_/status/1449617792613818371?s=21
well i suppose he's happy about ||fido||

to continue from this, feels to me it was intended to look like a MV really.
the point is that it mixed the 2d and cgi very well for that sequence which is about as good as you can make it be.
from what you usually get for cgi sequences in idol shows its a mile above them
tldr a dnd nerd
found it in the depths of hell
https://twitter.com/yanaginokanata/status/1445654287237849094
it has mini-anime and the author tling them in english is the cutest thing ever
sounds like a kid, is a kid
thats the point
adapt it
which is what an adaptation should do
it's better then the source for the most part
the adaptation changes the ln around
thats the point
disagree
s1 last few eps were amazing
no
86 just continues to be a stellar adaptation
pokemon manga in general is based
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
no matter if its bad or good
more like every publicity is good <:Teedus:830165389950189609>

well thats not really the studio's fault usually
its Bones like prev seasons
there's basically like "10 chapters" left, although the caveat is that the chapters are using x.x format so its closer to like 30-50ish?
should be

<:Ver:704169051391524875>
for free
just download the ep and you have 25mins worth of nft screen caps
not the anime screenshots they'll sell
just give me like actual keyframes
i would burn them too, like my male servants in fgo
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
or good old cells auctions
then you actually physically own them
just buy a bd if you want to own keyframes <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
but yeh i hope it isn't gonna get too much traction
<:YuriShrug:799671394114732032>
they'll ntf it
my secret is out, gotta go
kinda soon too
yeah
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
its funny cs half an ep later they do the same thing and actually redraw the close-up
so it looks blurry and pixelated
https://puu.sh/IjCF0.jpg
they zoomed in on that image <:KEK:739953921895694417>

not enough
i just think they could actually have used the time on better shit
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it's nothing too bad but there's multiple over the ep. tis also like 16 eps in now so was gonna happen anyway although they usually managed better before
example
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/496650964384743434/900795033182154812/2021-10-22_00_59_02-2021-10-22_00_56_39-Greenshot.png_-_Photos.png
it had quite a few off models that are close up shots which are like the worst ones to do.
~~art was all over the place too compared to some prev eps~~
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
they also could have just not done this ep, it wouldn't change anything
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
~~but those were the best eps~~
that death mom hair though
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
https://anidb.net/creator/1016
https://asahi-pro.co.jp/
it is
need to find that sweet spot
ye
compared to yeah kc and al etc
yeah but there's no trace left of that
not even AL anime was this bad on the designs
there's a lot of uniqueness removed by changing the designs to 1 general one
~~they also look bad in the anime~~
worst part of all that its totoro and kouki himself explaining it
<:painpeko:856324872913682473>

watching the ML stream, jumped in at the right timing it seems

bad

and if you want to nitpick he worked on symphogear too
he always has been one of us
now doing superstars
he did the OG LL then did gems
pls
which i think would be fine
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
but as long as kyougokou is still on LL guess that aint happening
land of lusterous
what we need is gems s2
if it airs after niji though F
probably pv during the live then
was expecting it during the live
too nobodies surprise
well yes but its just moving panels
producer
household husband mafia show on netflix
the one who did the not really animated shows
look at that hack producer at jc staff
like
a lot of it really comes down to the producer for a show
and the producer just being ballsy af to let the char designer who also did ad work keep the uncorrected works
more the staff
that's less deen
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
even aniplex dipped from the production committee lmao
everyone gave up on that show, can't blame them
<:RadioDoubt:595727226650230815>
log horizon me thinks
but you always watch outsourced eps <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
until you look at credits etc
from an outsider view
all major studio's do outsourced eps for other studio's and you wouldnt even be able to tell
Deen isnt so bad as to fuck up some outsourced eps
and correcting them as necessary before sending them back if they're not good enough
the AD is still gonna be olm checking the frames they get back
that too and like
there's a difference lmao
this just the norm
(if you take Komi for example this season, the show is produced by OLM and they did episode 1 but ep 2 and 3 were done at Deen)
and unless your ufotable or kyoani you generally outsource episodes anyway
its just help someone out and get help back
(freelancer life)
they overlap a lot of staff
high chance
so you can probably expect trigger in the credits too helping yostar out
helping out trigger on every show
they've mostly been doing all of the commercials for their gacha's azur lane shorts
^well it will be but lol
they have an animation studio since 2020
yes
it could also be 10min eps for all we know a la al short
should be fine storywise but might actually might in later eps
with the people from the commercials
its yostar themselves doing the show
the short anime is from this year
at least for the anime
2 years
there's plenty of those probably
so i would honestly count it
it just got delayed until this year
but the game was announced before the anime
that too
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
that one was delayed
yes

idm forehead girls too but its not iori so pass
I'm not even watching it so guess
and mappa just hires the whole industry lmao
(and by that i mean director of ngnl, yorimoi)
they do still have a few interesting creators on board
it's why madhouse is a former shell, lots of people left after murayama left
make interesting and fun shows but a low quantity of them > there's a switch in policy > murayama leaves to create a new studio cs the new vision isn't to his liking > pump out shows after shows
kinda ironic both murayama's studio's went the same way
it's mappa v1
madhouse is weird
this is a fun one from science saru 
```“I have some horror stories from this studio, which are thankfully fewer than some of SARU's competitors. But – and this is a big one for me – a studio should not have its twenty-something girls crying in the bathroom, doing all-nighters.```
most studio's pay shit (or in case of mappa not pay you at all lmao)
ufo had that dumb maternity leave a few years back
at least pay wise
unless kyoani or ufo
yeah
he's also not of the youngest anymore
toll on his health
and that's where their problems come from
and ss isnt exactly big
working on them at the same time
when yuasa quit as president and Choi took over SS took on like 5 projects at the same time
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
the sequel novel is getting adapted too
yes
that too
currently airing heike
ping pong, tatami galaxy
yuasa's studio
both for different reasons ofc
there's like 2 studio's that jump out straight away for issues and its mappa and science saru
it wasnt really hard to guess
well
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
yup
big in the sense that they do a lot of shows the past few years and probably will in the feature
well "big"
yes
(28k yen)
https://puu.sh/Ikuor.png
aya want to guess the studio?
~~wish it was as easy to blame the studio~~
but its never that easy
ofc the studio is gonna get the flack for it
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
imagine having the balls to say to a well respected (which tends to get all of the cursed series too) director to barely animate the show
its not animated
im on ep 4 i think <a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
pffff
sonny boy <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and she's one of them
they have like a few interesting creators left
i mentioned that though
its basically a different studio then it used to be so w/e
aint gonna disagree but its not the same as madhouse pre 2012
yea
i would say look at the credits, there should be something there if toyota sponsors it
wouldn't blame you lmao
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i thought you were gonna say god eater cs you said cell shaded
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
what show?
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
not on the first
i might on the second ep
no
burger asked for jc staff sequels that werent disaster productions
thats not what he asked for
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
doesnt count
hi score girl is by the producer that hates anime
and amanchu
danmachi
and the bigger problem they would never be able to solve even with amazing animation was the poor editing in s2
granted the bd's fair a lot better then the tv airing of the show but its still not a sakugafest like in s1
and then you get opm2
yeah and then jc staff already how too many shows and accepted it
bandai wanted s2 out asap
that ones easy
but it didnt get dragged down by crappy cgi like s3 <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
it dragged on an episode or 2 too long imo but it wasnt bad
arent excecute orders fun <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
bandai really did fuck that one so hard
opm s2 <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
they're pretty wild on twitter
it's clearly no og cardcaptor but yeah
jp side isnt as negative about it as the west was
well not wrong
that feels more like a western thing
they all went back to do it
its by the og staff too lol
they did the new one too
they did all of the cardcaptors? lol
once in a while they get that gem, were a lot more consistent before
now its just eh whatever
was hella lot stronger before the split though
its basically him and her and the rest of their director line isnt as strong
and tbf only mentioned sonny boy bcs it's done (as was opm and boogiepop) by their second other good director
madhouse made quite a few marvel anime
its on the list to watch
unless its idols
i havent finished anything the past 2 years <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
chihyaya is good
pls i do
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
i havent even finished chihaya s3
aya
m8
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
i enjoy sonny boy so i aint gonna say a yes to that yet
it doesnt take risks
you could do that at any studio
its not actually like madhouse
but that ones just by the numbers
quite a few
they did shorts anime too
but yeah thats nexus
ye
faltered towards the end imo but it had strong start and decent middle
was weird
i liked it enough
<:15min:655058014495047690>
why do you thibk rezero director and author did granbelm at nexus
but like many they wanted to focus on their own shows
and do other sidejobs
they handled 9 of rezero's s1 episodes
animation studio lol
they lost nexus too after s1 to help out
so WF had to use what they had
bcs everyone left to bind lmao
why do you think that was aya
i'm not
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
re:zero died for mushoku
you cannot live from a single show
thats just bait aya lmao
hey
produce more then you can handle
which is the thing Mappa is doing right now too
but their work ethic is just produce what you can (and sometimes produce too much)
jc staff is old and big
anime isnt always that lucky
so when jc staff got the movie they were able to go there to do it
but yeah it happened to be that the staff for konosuba was available at that time
the movie and s3 (coming soon) is jc staff
deen doesnt konosuba anymore lmao
freelancer ahoy
yes
s3
konosuba
you know what was fine they did as a sequel?
thats not what was asked but sure <:15min:655058014495047690>
so does cloverworks but its like one and the same
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
A1 actually has inhouse cgi and composite studio's now
every other studio has to outsource everything else eventually
the only thing kyoani can't do inhouse is like music and video mastering
and is in korea
(studio blue is owned by kyoani though)
for backgrounds
to studio blue at times
tbf
kyoani outsources too
lmao aya
ufo and kyoani are the exceptions
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
considering every studio outsources yes
the joke here cypher is that every studio does the same amount of outsourcing
m2 is a "animation"studio too btw aya
danmachi was inhouse, accel got shafted and demon girl is the usual jc staff
demon girl, accel and danmachi i think it was?
i think demon girl aired that season too?
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
it was accelerator
right
oh
and danmachi 3 was one of them
they had like 3 shows in that season
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
thats technically what M2 does too
they wre labeled as animation production but outsourced every ep yes
its was a slice of life too
no that they never did a single episode for a show but i forgot which one
there is a joke to be said here somewhere
i dont think the producer for that show is still at jc staff but i could be wrong
eh low
imagine anime studio's ever changing
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
and jc staff just sticks out bcs of the amount they do
the difference is the quantity of shows they make per year
<:15min:655058014495047690>
every studio has
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
white fox
rezero s2 wasn't all that bad but animation constrained with the peddles they had to row with
then WF after s1 bled empty or so to speak
handled lots of workload
thenm helped wf on rezero
shit pay is shit pay so no wonder he left tbh
and then he left sunrise and started working in programming in ruby
Vale leaked so much sunrise shit it wasnt funny anymore <:LUL:545650745534447631>
aya
the guy who translated symphogear at commie did in fact work in an animation studio
it really sucks Vale left sunrise
well horizon they explained
not existent
like horizon s3
they're gonna fuck gundam at this rate though
im watching that
well they're old and big

char is looking at idols
thats on the same wall as honoka tho
but yeah its nice
https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/max600x600/cms/interest.2/178599/sunrise3.jpg
instead of more iconic series for them
but its just funny they actually put honoka on the wall
i know about char
https://cdn.animenewsnetwork.com/thumbnails/max600x600/cms/interest.2/178599/sunrise4.jpg
<:15min:655058014495047690>
with love live you mean
it looks really nifty
sunrise is moving buildings next year
orange was godzilla SP with bones
Shirogumi for 86
Orange? nah
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
nobody reads what you write
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
not the show
of the girls i think
and nobody gave him names
i think lanks just wanted names
already means you're not interested anymore
if you need an excuse then you should be dropping them
<:painpeko:856324872913682473>
you'll get overlord s3 cgi
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
pls
but for now its funny
and if these guys are supposed to do the witch gundam next year  and it has cgi its gonna be the biggest whiplash ever
its 2d
not even the bg cars are 3d
every fucking mechanical thing is 2d
but yeah kyoukai is interesting cs like
so yeah unless sunrise does a 180 you're never getting more horizon
<a:Lightevil:736675535563915275>
the staff working on them
all of their upcoming shows
btw horizon ||the non-official statement from within sunrise is that the show's setting was so insanely complex they didn't want to bother with it ever again despite the show being successful||
both are good
idolmaster is better then LL by miles
you know what i mean
pls
its better then sunshine s1 by default just by not trying to be LL <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
heh
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
i played that one
looks pretty 2000s good
https://puu.sh/Ikz86.png
isnt actually bad looking
https://puu.sh/Ikz7v.png
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
its pre 2004 nice
well
its by no doubt trash
anime is 2004
or earlier
the game is like 2004
well its an old game so it might be more regular vn styling
mars of destruction
it all makes sense now
he has like track record of worst shows ever made
oh its the MoD director
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
maybe?
all i know about is that the art is nice
helter skelter thing
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
its idea factory
makes snese
so like vn like with rpg elements?
its like neptunia without the jokes
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
yes
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
it has 2 games
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
so its a bad anime based on a bad game
dont ask me for the third member though
its the only way i remember
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
chika va saving my ass
anju
its the only good part in the movie lol
at least the first part, the second part is right
idk about that
hard to say
arise was never developed
you can be friends and be a rival too
same with ss
they friends now
or were
they're rivals <:15min:655058014495047690>
3 songs in like 24 eps isnt much
sunnypa is more like A-Rise where they barely have any songs in the anime
so lots of songs and singles so they could do their own lives
sunshine went hard on SS bcs of the lives
its actually closer to s1 in that regard
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
the real question is, it will probably will get a movie too after s2 and will it be worse then the abomination that is the sunshine movie
lose against enemy idols, defeat them next time
it's just franchise staples
aqours lost to SS too
thats fine anyway
why did they get the aikatsu designer <:LUL:545650745534447631>
sunny passion is in the wrong show too
honoka is ||eternal||
so its a win either way
but they also didnt do the fucking dumb recap final sunshine did
in either case second half wasnt as strong as first half
that won to go to LL
its the notaikatsu duo
they lost remember
lmao
they never even made it into LL
fuck CG
CG is bad
niji is too far up its ass with introducing new girls to even have time for that plotline
instead of actually starting with the school is closing down we need to win love live
they did it and directly undid it
unlike the previous shows
they never actually tried to pull that trick the whole way
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
if she didnt muse would be on stage naked
wrong
og pairings are actually based
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
not like she has one in the anime
the anime changed stuff
the manga is closer to the og girls from the magazine
yeah bcs that what she did
for the better though
they changed them for the anime
og muse cast had a different personality
we can see who are the anime onlies here <:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
well she wasnt
and yet also fits muse for that
I have the bin ready
<:15min:655058014495047690>
hopefully not nico
why fkn why
in the movie it was just <:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
it made sense
the third years were fine in the tv-anime tbh
moreso on the plot then the characters but i can see that
but like the content is just bad
the girls are nice and so are the interactions
anyway not like introducing you's cousin could save the first hour of the movie
she has good doujins
how could I
yea
good
symbolism <:pog:515960701484007453>
~~my favourite sunshine ep is the one where chika tears up her muse posters to show the show is finally done musing muse and make aqours their own thing~~
when it found its footing
sunshine had a good s2 at least
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
avex still fucked them so rip
Zoo was great
imagine them being legally available
<a:aWorryNinja:771065617322344500>
the movie explains the hair sort of
<:painpeko:856324872913682473>
poor girls
fuck s2
wug good, avex did them dirty
no time need to sleep
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
pls make more idols
idols good
what i gathered from this long convo
you know
i was gonna post the same thing lmao
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
implying she wouldnt eat both
maru would eat my hamburgers so she's out
<:15min:655058014495047690>
didnt really expect to have sumire and keke such a good chemistry with each other though
pretty good duo
they surprisingly bounce well of each other
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
ash hates her but keke is the best
both anime wise and irl
i dont think any LL group is ever gonna reach what Muse did
ask me again in like 3 years after both niji and superstar got a movie 2 <:LUL:545650745534447631>
so a lot more fleshed out
all of the other entries are like old and niji has the game too
well superstar is too new tbh
yes
that niji sucks?
so i can go to bed
pls do
now i can finally dip out
good it switched ot niji
still too happy lucky imo but yeh it has a few of those eps
budoukan is great
it's a happy go lucky series so idk what they expected eh
so basically wug ep 1-2 but a whole season
yeh
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
<:sakuraweary:443271129113559050>
wug live was so good too
<a:BonkCat:684146912298926101>
(also watch the movies, they're great)
also make it look terrible
<:pain:848226587006468177>
welcome to wug s2
imagine introducing the group that's gonna be your replacement, spend most runtime on them and fuck over the runtime you do have
unlike the happy go lucky other idol shows
wug didnt really shy away
its sadly enough the actual reality for this
anyway
pls
we should though <:LUL:545650745534447631>
s1?
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

nice
younger, not older
but spoilers
it can get worse
someone should add in the ||delta version||
just need to wait months to watch it
zettai live is apparently pretty good too
should have just said it
no
<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
it's like that but without ||the killing||
you watched school days?
i would have said closing chapter is like wa1 but you wouldn't understand
damn fuck
you ever watched white album 1?
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
never gonna get the fun stuff
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
the anime already adapted that
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
closing chapter adaption never
i had to think too for a moment
that's fair
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
haruki and kazusa
its white album 2
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
the joke is that it isnt yuri
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
<:YuriShrug:799671394114732032>
idk how much riders saber has but all stars movies have like all the cures
wouldn't that technically be the precure all stars movies?
so it must have been KR
and then gaim dropped
toei and a name i don't understand
is this some kamen ridee joke im too dumb to understand?
and people were fine with that
and its probably worse cs you could call it grooming
hugtto has it too
imagine being mad at straigt romance
aya with the bad posts
how would he even sue though
it will be censored on a broadcast
it's gore
genre doesn't matter
pls
why bother
you're basically watching a permanent censor
lol never
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
kids can't buy the 30k bd boxes for precure
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
imagine kids watching precure
thanks bandai
i can still install it <:ShirabeThink:849647550750785556>
the puzzle phone game is still up i think?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it has gacha too
bold to think precure doesn't have pachinko
there must always be a precure

looking at you healin good
~~princess lulu~~
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
the show still needs to move
well at most you're getting cameo eps like hugtto if you want more
it's ice skating henshin so i would lowball 700 bucks lmao
there's a few animators actually accepting that stuff on skeb but what you want sounds a lot more expensive then there bare minimum listed
https://tenor.com/view/youknow-you-gif-19056787
sounds very expensicd
<:ChrisHibikiHug:630262562361049121>
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
you're worse jk
feels like its aya being aya
<:rookek:757559512143101994>
even though japan sure is trying
not everything is fit to made anime
i wouldn't be opposed to a saya anime, it's just one of the worst properties to make into anime
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
spice stabbing ||https://twitter.com/DESTROYBINARY/status/1453078652216877058?t=_BoEFu0iegjGa6gyklGQsA&s=19||
the warning is for stuff like this kek
lmao melua, sounds like a blast
Unless it's actually superbad
it's idols so im watching it anyway
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
only a few times on specific eps, not something they generally use
it's apparently cute and not much going on and then it flips around and does something with detailed violence
yeh this not ep 1, this in other eps
it has ||cutting limbs and blood and stabbing and blood|| so makes somewhat sense
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>

but im millhi so it can only be dog days
nonono i am one
wtf
they didnt do it yet only the leadup?
not surprised if it was almost passable then <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
is it the 3vs3?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

all i heard about this ep was booba

inb4 ash saying he sees cute girls
wouldnt you too when your premise is so terrible
😐
bofuri first, then maou
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
sounds like a good plan for bofuri when they start throwing around tech stuff
unless your index, yen on (press) is gonna be pretty slow
somewhat ye
anime ends on v4
ln is at v9
so pretty far behind eh
dun think it was when the anime came out?
i need to buy the official volumes
they even hired a mech specialist for it
anime had it too
lmao
the mechs are the only saving grace the show has
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
can they just air the playthrough instead
fkn hell

~~although that face isnt giving me confidence~~
can't be as bad as last weeks i hope
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
dk is also kind of busy to even do one
only despair
they don't want to give us hope
never
thats just you being horny
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
>a few
but yeah hanakana singing about panties is never gonna get old
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
did that, bad idea
*not advised doing that
teekyu good
teekyu sure is
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
its called gekidol
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
that also
it is
never actually seen anyone saying that about higehiro
~~kinda ironic the meme shows are the best shows this year~~
molcar is just amazing
the shorts this year in particular have been running away with shit tbh
its a wrong opinion <:15min:655058014495047690>
thats actually wrong
but january was the best seasonal
smart
this lily
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvEPpl19joI
how many lns put they in s3?
its just so fucked and bastardized
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
its all original
pls
the pacing is off too
so its not gonna be 72 eps
you forget about all of the original content they added
it is though
you can insert any series instead of toaru cs thats how adaptations usually turn out*
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
where nothing truly happens
it's also just a good romcom
<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>
you're never gonna get extra or unlimited anime bcs someone deemed it would be better to see mecha fights
almost all are sterile by the book adaptations
like every adaptations really
it sucks as an anime
its an adaptation so w/e
muv luv only looks good when there's a tsf on screen
even at its worst eps
index at least looks better
the anime is trash
it matters a lot
they're literally skipping everything so it feels like nothing happens
its not hard to understand lanks
yeah bcs they're skipping everythging
dont care about the characters bcs they removed them
no emotional baggage too, its all sterilized
they put 10+hs of content in a 15sec flashback removing everything about the characters
it should have been 24 eps for this alone
its the other way around
lmao
> slow
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
except its 50hs in 12 eps
its like watching muv luv this season
there was basically no time to breath
like
they're all  changed
<:sakuraweary:443271129113559050>
can we have the old va's back too
spoiler that
<:JustFine:597629265147723777>
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
but it still looks more like meiya then the anime
like it doesn't look like it has the vents too sideways
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/FCY9H3QVkAohGUX?format=jpg&name=large
but like it looks miles better then what they did on the anime
i'm not that big a fan of the phone designs
they nerfed everythign about the girls
aya pls
wouldnt know
i skip the op and ed
its bad
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
why would you watch it
anything would have been better
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
but was the author fed up with that show? i think not
just so they can adapt everything but >muv luv
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
maybe they'll go back and adapt the second half of total eclipse
you know
lol can't even disagree
no
and it has been ages since it came out
there's a reason why ML vn's is still considered one of the better vns lmao
<:ikkib:235621294920433664>
i'll watch stuff tonight or tomorrow
listened to it again when you posted it earlier
good op too
liking it
y
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
so rumbling hearts can't be missing
well we do need the full muv luv experience
and english support too
ye
hope we get new info soon about rumbling hearts too
this a new part ye
ye the new title
muv luv (in the name of true love)
resonative
the name is super cheesy too
the new vn too from what we have seen so far
yup
we're gonna have to get used to the new ones though, they'll be on every new ml release
which i think is fine to do but like don't do it on a franchise like ML
i think avex wants to push new va's instead
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
granted her char is nerfed hard too
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
just replaced
too
and she was in TE anime
the total eclipse girl that shows up eventually also has a new va
i hope they at least cast different va's then sunshine
<:ServalMad:539799753467363339>
ofc
but neko rich girl is best
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
nagisa is second and im like ????
rena is like 4th place
Suzu
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
just check the voting of each girl
tfw mistress is in last place
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
if you got to the website <http://pjselection.com/> and scroll down to the girls you can vote on your favourite girl once a day
have you been voting btw?
mistress still best girl too
indeed
~~which actually would be better~~
or well i can see this happening too||they get canned during the duration of SP but everyone is just such good friends they end up forming a group together afterwards||
||they gotta be able to release stuff after bcs its a multimedia project so no way they're canning anyone||
||and then they'll upset the whole SP idea of 1 person winning and everyone will win||
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
SP has the better production values though
yeah idoly pride did the ||idol dying and the heart stuff too||
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
same
it's literally the same but in a different jacket
god it would have been funny if this airing earlier in the same season as idoly pride
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
yeah that's also a possibility
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
tldr it's literally idoly pride
so i guess next up is drama when Rena finds out <:LUL:545650745534447631>
esp with the above piccie
yeah it just makes too much sense
||When she was talking about how Akari saved her life she meant it literally, when Akari died they transplanted her heart in Suzu so she could survive.||
well that makes it easy to guess what happened
SP5 was thinking at the end when  Suzu ran down to change clothes it was to hide operation scars, few seconds later ||https://puu.sh/IlNzn.png||heh
aint that part of the fun
<:ServalMad:539799753467363339>
fripside existed before her too
just not with nanjolno
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
fripside
so good
probably
yes
~~with the new cast bcs fck you~~
<a:CatjamR:743099296580370492>

Alternative
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
then it would actually be a gag anime
man they should have just made all of the show look like this https://puu.sh/IlO0U.jpg
big pain hour
ruined design too
<:painpeko:856324872913682473>
sumika
~~every ep has been~~
time for ML <:painpeko:856324872913682473>
oh where was it
https://puu.sh/IlNOA.png
exactly
and master is third
thats a lot of counter for counters
and terribad management isnt anything new for A1/CW
but they feel less like CW and more like production committee shenigans
but yeah there's valid concerns tbh
<a:Lightevil:736675535563915275>
the one with the tits
yes
that one chapter
gives them only a few months turn around
and then april is s3?
and have the OVA soon
they're still producing visual prison rn
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
thats the problem
no
its kaguya you should be worried about
but yeah bisque should be fine
:^)
its just an avalanche of everything going wrong
he send in his drafts late so the director (or whoever handled sbs for later eps) couldnt do them in time
the writer
and that snowballed everything else like an avalanche
biggest problem wep had was storyboards being deliver months late
less to be worried about lmao
they are on Bisque
and that team is irrelevant
well WEP was sort of the extreme
<:15min:655058014495047690>
science saru?
so eh
its not bcs it doesnt show it isnt falling apart tho
mahoutsukai was lucky enough to have not have it as visible
its the second half of their shows where schedule catches up to them the most
they always have a good first half buffer
that also fell apart
the only show wit did with a good schedule was great pretender
if you want to compare falling apart at the ends towards shows then yes yo ushould be more worried about with then cw
it can exist after her too
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
~~just look at ML this season~~
<:pain:848226587006468177>
that happens sometimes
you're watching shit that just works until that one ep where they pull out all the stops
most long running shounen are like that
besides the shit ones
they're stuck on those good BC eps though
but pierrot has a pretty good team available if they want too
you say that
i still dont think bridge was actually the right choice for the reboot but yeh
ye
slowed down a fair bit for the new content
they rushed through the shit already animated
SK also did that
~~this feels less like studio problems now and more like industry problems~~
mostly ye
lol
but apparently successful enough to get a sequel announced
they gave it an ending
which was the problem with eh shadows house tbf
its all okay
ditf existed so eva lived
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
idm
they're skipping some floors
doesn't look like they're going for a 1:1 adaptation of progressive tho
https://twitter.com/sao_anime/status/1455097782088257544?t=hmW6r0m4jmbj3zbsryK3CQ&s=19
more sao
and so on the on-going trial between Kondo + Ufotable... 

``` the prosecution demanded that the president, Kondo, be sentenced to one year and eight months in prison and that the corporation be fined 40 million yen. The defense, on the other hand, stated that they were not aware that Kondo had used the tax evaded money for his personal use, and asked for a suspended sentence.```

verdict is on the 10th next month
<:harold:595434251286085653>
hopefully
lmao
it's just rearranging the volumes
so they're doing the something else volume first
he started writing an arc in v2-4 and then v5 was about something else
blame reki
this
maybe they'll go tv anime to introduce kizmel after this movie
gives its own spin on it instead of 1:1
but like i said, the anime condenses them a fair bit
10chapters a volume
the anime condenses a fair bit of them but show still good
yeah
like in s2
and then i think ep 7-12 is gonna be the actual sequel again
which means they end up on 6/12 eps again
they alreayd did 1 ep, prolly gonna get 1 more for nowayu
i expect 2 episodes though
its like 3eps max of content if they go that route
its only 2 volumes
they;re adapting said side material in this season
🖕
so where's s2 kadokawa
another new agematsu show
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-11-02/noriyasu-agematsu-elements-garden-rucca-reveal-techno-roid-multimedia-project-with-anime-game-music/.179118
its just that ep/scene thats fucked
if you scroll down on the twitter and check other sophia pic they actually look fine
for that ep
yes
(only that ep too, everything else posted on that twitter on other eps look a lot better)
spider keeps on giving
https://twitter.com/g6xa3awstGCEljS/status/1455451026861948931
also in other words it's november which means new precure title leaks. and its yer another cooking related precure ||https://twitter.com/trademark_bot/status/1455335949655687169?s=21||
<:Wakaru:834568786383994881>
well yes, the only purpose it had was to emulate the life action rubber suits which they succeeded in pretty well.
and mal was dead for over a year and no 3rd party support with the api disable for even longer and the new api is barebones
import your mal first before you delete it
hopefully when third mc gets introduced, this gonna get a bit better ye
2d mech porn at least
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
people might not even do that after the show ends
idk
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
the 3v3s was actually pretty good, the rest not so much ofc <:LUL:545650745534447631>
Muv Luv: Can we just get mecha fights all the time pls
although oikawa is doing another show with KAI for next year <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
<:pog:515960701484007453>
s3 focusing on diamond and kitasan
the game was supposed to launch with s1 tho but yeah kek
trainer in s1 is also pain
y
yeah <:LUL:545650745534447631>
well its a leak but eh
https://twitter.com/SugoiLITE/status/1456514256354955272?t=YiAb2dhOZ4yzRAO09pBWtg&s=19
first season was nice
tonikawa s2 <:pog:515960701484007453>
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
and satono diamond
mcqueen but i guess thats no surprise
yeah
~~would be ballsy too if they focused on like the kids of mcqueen lmao~~
||same fate as suzuka||
there's also rice shower
yeah there's some crazy shit out there
would love to see it tho
would be eh bold
well bar that one race but yeah
well writing about a horse that wins every single race gets pretty boring
it's partly why the anime ends the way it does cs there were no races left they ran together (or solo even)
and they dont really fit the gag character type like goldship
can't tbh, both of them practically retired after the events of the anime
would be fucking ballsy
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
that would be the final episode
<:pain:848226587006468177>
silence suzuka focus again would be good too if they want to wring the maximum drama out of the show
but not sure how compelling it would be to watch someone racing when she ||loses 95% of the time||
twin turbo would be absolute meme
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
<:pain:848226587006468177>
same? well the guy did the signs to cut the broadcast so hope they did
uminyan best cosplay
akari too cute for the show
finished aquatope ep
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
the first few lines on ep 1
they even say so in s2
maybe bcs the game makes bank anyway idk
they added her 3d model in race uniform a while back for the new training mode but  thats all
well not playable
no
like twin and kita and dia lol
also missing playable ones they should have added already
mobile has a lot of good horses
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
gyaru is good too
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
these guys don't know about the songs i think tho
likely
for the reason the dec 11 si delayed
they mention special programming
they would have enough buffer if it was just 1 ep delayed tbh
dec 11 ep is delayed too
attaching a popular name to something has a higher chance to get people to check it out
<a:aMariwhale:397936255632932875>
y
<:POGGERS:624583844900634634>
which one, lupin or ads the show
and tiger and bunny scripts
he did screenplays for multiple lupins
this at least not his first forray into anime
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
after all its written by a kamen rider writer
still waiting on the plottwist
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
did you expect a japanese person to be able to say yell?
narita brian
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
mcqueen, kita, twin turbo
~~it does however have quite a few horsies~~
bar a few they're new and this is their first role
nah
turbo is amazing
better then the other ballsack
and damn that laser class is cute
beta > noise
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
its below that
sorry
yeah im sorry aya, trash is better then mushoku
but film grain good
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i cant agree or disagree bcs im just not watching that trash
what do you have against film grain
which is <:yikes:443013856684408833>
netflix is releasing it in batches of 12 eps
makes sense anyway
in what way
well bar maybe mars of destruction and that other show
well anything is better then that
very
my taste is not that bad
cs quality content
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
tapped out after the flies chapter, that was yikes
its bad body horror
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
its trash so ive read parts of it
yes i know
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
its the same darn thing
even muv luv has better cgi animations
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
lmao
danke for reminding me to put it back to dark mode
https://puu.sh/InFsD.png
laser-kyun
well works better as a pfp too
https://puu.sh/InFeX.png
if you want a great isekai
its like inuyasha mel said earlier
what cypher means is that digimon came out before shows specifically got labeled as isekai
but the truth is that you're wrong
no
quality
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
well the anime man is click bait himself so
👀
is it time for mars of destruction
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
<:keking:806973155654631484>
arrows
i ment in the other world lmao
cypher pls
how else would you kill ||a dragon||
they could have sold it as a regular fantasy and it wouldn't change a thing
it's really just a dnd campaign in a novel adapted in an anime
saihate no paladin?
but what mel said is the problem with paladin really, it's really just a dnd work but isekai tackled on bcs that sells but it actually does nothing in the setting
it's more like just eternal mecha knownledge in case of ernie tbh
ye solo
```Onara Gorou follows the everyday life of Gorou, the "most admirable of farts," as he solves problems in ways that only a fart can. ```

truly an amazing show
gotta isekai for that cypher
dropped bcs never getting subbed
https://puu.sh/InTxZ.png
i dont even rate my drops anymore
nowadays if i rate a show below a 5 it wil lgo o nthe drop list anyway
eased the pain cs we could just shittalk during the eps
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i watched it with a friend
thats what i want to know
my lowest not dropped is eh
https://puu.sh/InTuv.png
besides 5mins in the show so far barely anything relevant, maybe later but idk
Netflix though, rip all the fun ads
cw....
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
true quality
what it looks amazing
new nanatsu is quality
hot damn

<a:15min:490152208827154442>
jojo confirmed 12 ep batches
bigger pain to train in the game then rice tho
clumsy cute
lol meisho
yes
i like helios
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
it should be blue
while that's not even possible at that time
did you notice in the trailer the tsf at shado is purple
but that would be brrrrr again
the trailer had sado so maybe....
possibly
guess season finale will be ||the coup||?
better then going brrrr like the first 4 eps
MLA gonna take it slow now eh

<@279341087494242304> it gets even better
the manga is far stronger tbh
that it was gonna be centaur no nayami when you said monster girls, discrimination and dark side of things
knew it
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
men actually gave them nicknames
they finally had a dance segment in this weeks ep
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
doga needs to chill
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
lol if the letter actually gets send to rena
not that i'm aware
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
well "borrowing" cs both shows would have been in pre-prod at the same time
so good and yet so wrong at the same time
||https://puu.sh/IoISk.png||
dw ash
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
6 eps in kaginado and they can't keep getting away with this
the movie adapts everything left
not possible
havent seen arte its probably the same?
if anything tonikaku was pretty conservative animation wise
well old and new is sometimes hard to compare
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
still not as bad as mappa's 20+ an ep to even keep a show afloat
only 8 ads
this seven arcs so don't expect too much
>watching anything takehiro
im just glad they actually sort of slowed down
lol solopy, im not even expecting anything anymore
(and in case of the Suzumiya sisters they got the original dub VA's back from the rumbling hearts dub)
for one or another reason they dubbed mikhail so everyone basically has a dub actor if they wish to dub the anime <:LUL:545650745534447631>
wonder if they'll actually dub the anime <:think_jii:688734639094890520>
?
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/854169017014681640/905042253356101632/Project_Mikhail.jpg
they replaced it with a video <:LUL:545650745534447631>
or well it was
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
its on the website
meiya?
https://puu.sh/IqsQN.png
paladin is recap too next week <:pain:848226587006468177>
just a reminder that aniplex is bad at scheduling shows <:LUL:545650745534447631>
if they conveyed it? <:ashrug:558439555599040552>
aniplex would have known about it
they could air those as a 1h special in the worst case at the end of next season
well 1 would have been planned around for but the other 2 yeah
ye
which might actually give them more time then just a week extra
if there's nothing airing in the slot it should be fine but if there is it's gonna be like towards the end of next season
scheduling conflicts are gonna be a pain tho
doubt
always sucks
<:painpeko:856324872913682473>
hope for everything but the subs in the vid <:LUL:545650745534447631>
SP: well that went about how i said it would <:LUL:545650745534447631>
they're just good at bruteforcing it
it has been since prev season <:LUL:545650745534447631>
but yeah they need all the help they can get on 86 so actual outsourced ep wouldnt be that bad
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
tft

<:15min:655058014495047690>
everything should be on point
(which is really shitty when its a show about art)
they're doing blue period this season and it prolly as bad as muv luv is with animation mistakes
long preprod cycle <:LUL:545650745534447631>
then deadsilence until today
yeah s3 got announced 2 years ago
s2 adapted the second vn and this season gonna adapt the third vn
https://anilist.co/anime/856/Utawarerumono/ s1 was pretty good 
years later they released 2 new visual novels
franchise i like
<:15min:655058014495047690>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tST43VPdudU
oh nice it's still alive
~~if only the show was as good as the suffering kukuru gets~~
best muv luv girl
yeah
*soon:™*
my wife (or at least the back)
https://puu.sh/Irguj.png
its a damn triple vn
>mobile
well preprod can be good but actual prod can be disasterous so ye
well we knew the leak but they finally announced it for real
https://twitter.com/toeianime_info/status/1463975781491691521
~~best show is kaginado~~
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
as if its gonna stop asanagi
just looks off compared to ln
https://puu.sh/Irphf.jpg
lol nice anime char designs
the only sort of delay was in 2019 with covid
straight shot since futari
there must always be a precure
etc
molcar, odd taxi, uma2
molcar is aots material too
same
they could for the comings eps but at the end it's gonna be all 9 lol
there's no way they're actually gonna yeet one of the main 9 in the end
yeah its a multi media project
SP: that went a bit faster then expected, thought they would spend an extra episode at minimum on it but guess they're gonna use next ep for more rena (and the voting results)

next season eh
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
there isn't (yet)
yes
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
what about cute boys doing insert sport here?
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
just consider it a pilot if its 1 ep and if it does well then maybe yostar wants to do more
yeh
im watching it ofc
idk could be more
golf is just 1 ep from what I'm award
well "same people*
i do like how cue already has a better key visual then any shot in muv luv and its the same people
if it turns out good maybe but not initially picking it up
probably not
the only other 2 i might pick up are gfl (which looks like trash) and bisque
well at least gotta ride it out
that's just lanks his terrible taste
forgot to say this earlier when i finished the ep but amaim where are my goofy robots <:bbdisgust:639169734117425164>
<:Wakaru:834568786383994881>
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
I'll watch it when s2 airs or something
🐌
i still haven't watched the bondrew movie
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
dw ive read this part and i dont remember either
the latter
when you said it, it was about dyna no?
read the other line
y
same
(and wasnt he also talking about dynazenon for that?)
yeah solo finally eh
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
what timeline are we in
an actual good MLA ep
man
https://puu.sh/IsRCf.png
<:hyp:875844066905063475> 
https://puu.sh/IsRtD.png
the part straight after is <:JustFine:597629265147723777>
god bless these adorable dorks
well not as expected after that
as expected
||https://puu.sh/Itk5e.jpg||
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
that's a few steps too far
kukuru gets to be attendant again and the show will end
nowhere
rookie numbers
only
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
maybe after reki finishes sao
i just don't believe in more aw after the stunt they pulled with the movie
lol
<:YuriShrug:799671394114732032>
then again the progressive movie isn't exactly faithful to the ln so its also it's own thing
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
if he's gonna keep going like this it's more like there will be a 16.5.1 16.5.2 etc etx
lmao
and do it like how it was intended
reki wants to change the ending anyway
idk might happen
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
kayaba isn't really but then the other guy in sao was
yeh it's a big issue in sao in general
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
90 floors to go
progressive is on floor 10 or so atm
it's gonna be a while
it's sao only so nothing after that (until reki also decides to rewrite those lmao)
not in the reboot
well that one doesn't exist lol
intentionally tugs at your heartstrings too bc of course why wouldn't they <:LUL:545650745534447631>
fun show
https://anilist.co/anime/132528/Kaginado/
clannad, little busters, etc
think isekai quartet but only for KEY shows
the KEY multiverse short
kaginado is besto
second for me i think
show actually keeps impressing me every time even though it's predictable at times
was cute scene
yeh
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
don't forget about the movie being half a recap too
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
slow burns do be like that <:ashrug:558439555599040552>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
just meme the whole show in the Oingo Boingo Brothers style
yeh
horses don't joke around
its a literal nightmare to animate too
horses go brrr
12 eps ye
I'm supposed to try  Otome no Teikoku <a:CUHRAYZEEvera:624583288803033138>
can't tell what comes after cs i have been reading trashy lns instead <:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
most of the series has been about shimamura realising what she is and what value a relationship has.
and spoiler ||they start dating in v6||
it's just doing its stuff in a realistic way. anyway them getting together is probably the end of the ln.
at a slow pace
but things are happening <a:15min:490152208827154442>
ye
<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>
the alien was annoying in the prev work too<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
same tbh
yes bit still super slow
good shit tho, at least the ln <:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
adachi has that problem too :^)
the anime stops before it goes anywhere and you dont get a sequel
citrus like most other just have the on-going syndrome <:LUL:545650745534447631>
pls
actually wrong
took a look at the guy's studio and seems they have primarily been doing tv ads and support work.
and actas is owned by bandai after the gup fiasco so i guess actas
well the biggest sponsor was bandai
well director made his own studio, so maybe who knows
flip flappers team isnt even at 3hz anymore <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
lol
yeh I'm doing the same as ash, gonna wait for the movies to be out
ah the movie
CH?
<:thinkan:286255670649552897>
The Great Passage/Fune wo Amu
i dont even have a single clue what's on amazon prime, besides that one dictionary show i watched on it
oh yeh
depending country
well wouldnt most of those be legally available?
the english name is easier to say anyway

<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>

would hate it if they cliffhanger one super hard and then wait for like 2 years to know what's up
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
it's fine
aldnoah
it falls under this
thats about his involvement
he wrote the first ep
yes but no
netflix bitrate will make the movie look shit anyway <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
i remember the belly dancing
fair, it's also just amusing WIT (and esp Araki) keeps doing these totally not aot action setpieces like it's just to rub it in
yah
Directed by Tetsuro Araki

Written by Gen Urobuchi

Original character design by Takeshi Obata

Music by Hiroyuki Sawano
lemme double
araki directing and action director too
should be
thanks araki
I like the totally not aot 3d manouver action setpieces

maaaaybe
I'll probably give the movies for that a try
just look at bubble this week
it's just easier to market a high profile va, they do the same thing for staff
pick a literal newbie or pick a high profile va. what would do better for marketing.
that's just the life of a high profile va
<:bbdisgust:639169734117425164>
don't forget to disable sound too so you don't recognize them
not always that easy to do tbh
that's what you get if its the same designer
would buy
they should give her a model kit with the kaiju form
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
that one eh
probably
yeah
been pretty good so far
didn't expect much from ghost game but its basically kitarou but digimon
I'm actually doing well this season, just behind on lupin and ghost game
it's what i generally gonna watch before an adaptation of something tbh
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
stop watching shows with ongoing stories
or singing if it was the kongou scene iirc
my fav ones for that kind of shit is still kc (even tho the anime sucks) 5 characters in different voices by the same va in the same scene talking always makes me laugh
<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>

<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
at least on an epilogue
timeskip seems probable
the last 5 minutes are good, the rest not really
in all honesty i don't really want k and f picked
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
am i hearing kaixkukuru
like that meme from a while back with the thing that made boobs move if you used your phone
isn't there that to love ru darkness volume with boob physics
their fault for picking the worst name possible and not expect people to meme it
prev ep did have the kumeyu blanks at least
sadly yes
they're just filling in all of the blanks
but it has been doing that all season, they're just giving more content regarding the events of s2 and added the other side of the coin, the sentinels (kumeyu) too it. (and added nowayu too)
artist group
he's the reason oldcodex is on hiatus too
he's only keeping the role in Free <:LUL:545650745534447631>
could look at the roles other people took over
he went on hiatus when scandal happened
he cheated on Lisa
they're replacing the va

Yuyuyu, would watch a season of yuuki yuuna's last tour
~~nice middlefinger logo~~
it's just like other recent PA works shows with good idea's bad excecutions
just put the fuuka development in the first half too and we would have gotten a pretty good show
^
like iski said, the second half would have been a lot better if they focused on fuuka instead of keeping it at the end
tbh not really
(she sang this too)
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k7ZWXiq3F8
she went to the better franchise
(timeslot conflicts bcs of the previous prod delays)
last 2 episodes of 86 are delayed too btw (ep 22 and ep 23)
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
all they got was 2secs of makima
yeh it's a teaser for the anime, it's just funny mappa stans were so high on something they kept saying full pv and cast list at jump festa event
doubt if its really netflix
which one
atleast jump got smart enough to let their blockbusters end early
and bnh is ending next year if all goes well
in 5 years
dick move
not anymore tho
yeh
and now he's back writing actual boruto after they kicked the og writer for it
i was gonna say let them write a new manga but kishimoto did that and it flopped
hopefully not
miss me with that trend of make a sequel but focus on the kids
hopefully it stays at that oneshot
which comes after end of bleach
isn't kubo gonna write hell arc
no
it was fun
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
and the kimetsu movie was pretty conservative all things ufo considered
those ratings are why yasahime exists too
like actual insane on tv ratings

shits insane
yeh kimetsu is a storm
~~and then you adapt the movie again in the next season too~~
don't forget to give it some movies too
they're actually letting them end early instead of keeping the authors stretching and stretching their story bcs it's popular
which i mentioned earlier is actually changing
and its not like op is the only one
i don't even think the length is the problem here
sounds good
no
so i have one for each day of the week
just gimme like 7 cgdct shows a season instead of 7 isekai.
WNs are generally awful anyway
i would have watched one of those videogame ones if he wasn't stuck in that world
nah none of them looked interesting
https://puu.sh/Ixifd.png

basically watching just this
gfl anime idk still cs everything they shown looks so bad.
i added akebi as a maybe depending on how friends and lanks like it
<:harold:595434251286085653>
4 shows, 2 maybe's and like that 1 ep mahouka show
yeh same

not really that made up a name
Schumacher is like a famous F1 driver
eh
rude
yeah very different but also pretty good
don't think i did
still wondering how exactly they're gonna do s2 for that.
that nana ED is banger too
it do be like that

<@171395487247630336> https://youtu.be/sPRh1njiJC8
the chars can't even suffer in the anime cs they don't exist
cowards
they should have ended the season with it
s1 ends post credits with the graduation ceremony
s2 is gonna start with "that"scene too

pls just let it die
except nagi no actually did it right
wasn't it itagaki that got fired on basquash <:think_jii:688734639094890520>
but that's just intertwined with Meiya development
i guess Yuuhi too
only meiya and takeru are characters <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
they're cardboards with their face
ofc
ofv
not the anime
use mikhail or immortal art as a base
but like
i wouldn't mind a remake
ye
this is during bisques timeslot
not long enough
https://twitter.com/anime_eightysix/status/1474008618769215498
<:nani:241228065357824001>
def closer to horsies s2 in that regard
well they forgot about singing for half the show
and its less ambitious either way
lol it should be in a better state
same producer so yes
but not like 2 weeks off is that much of a time relief
it's the wep team
and let's say the show after bisque is shorter, then why not do it after bisque ends or after that show ends if there's 2 timeslots over instead of doing it during in the middle of a show.
mostly a year in advance
<:harold:595434251286085653>
it's during bisque
aniplex <:sakuraweary:443271129113559050>
would have been nicer if they didnt middle finger the other show at least like they did this time
wtf is aniplex thinking
so are they delaying 2 eps of that show to air 2 eps of 86????
watched it just now before xmas stuff starts here
Also ash yer wer right  ||dorm mother is still ceo||

the tv-anime is fine
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
if you don't you'll have a bad time
i hope you like twinkle twinkle
:^)
still better then the aqours movie tho
the show just doesn't want to know what to do but in story and animation.
not to that extreme usually
but yeah what i can say about bang dream 1 is that it's a mixer where they put different ingredients in and hope they stick together but it really doesn't but it finds it's footing in s2 and gets pretty good.

the cliffhangers tho each movie <:LUL:545650745534447631>
watch daikon war too
and in the movie they're talking about stuff that didn't happen yet in the anime so its wonky too
eh it actually matters towards the end bcs of the family stuff that builds straight into s2
watch the special too today
they cut out the monologues yeh which its tetsuya explaining stuff usually ye
mahouka sequel too
https://twitter.com/mahouka_anime/status/1476953293410775042
or wait like 20 to 40 years for it to get a remake <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yeh
5 might be longer cs he has an unannounced show sometime in 22 or 23 so gonna be doing that first before penning 5
he did at least boarded 4 already so we might see 4 this year.
oh definitely but part is also on mizushima for gup.
hard to draw when there's no script <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
well its not really 2 years
there's always an ova with the movie
watch the ova too ash
knowing that already makes it a bit better
the actual show is probably quite different but prolly couldn't have made a worse trailer if they didn't want people to make comparisons
same thing
just going from that trailer alone it eeh.
>girl alone
>picked up by guy
>living at guys place
even then
looks like higehiro
nice faces

double precure OP in a row
i like how its machico again
and he means kayanon for enemy in the new precure
here's full page https://www.toei-anim.co.jp/tv/delicious-party_precure/character/cooking1.php

its a fetish show yes
outsourcing always gonna happen but yeah shouldnt be on the level of WEP
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
if you played muv luv you already know the aot ending
nah
but they can't finish the manga if they keep the same pace as the first half
its not
still gonna get a movie
but super did it every episode too kek
just like how dbsuper crashed crunchyroll
or the ddy version
yea you can get the bilibili version
that and it also just looks like shit <:LUL:545650745534447631>
I'm surprised they actually got Waki for the op
heh
lol the op and ed are the best thing about gfl anime
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/205/488/707.jpg
either both the OP and ED are basically that mr incredible meme
I'm not a fan of that kind of metal
i do like the visuals but not the song
i really don't like it
ye das cool
lol
and my last show for this season doesn't start until februari
but yeh I'm gonna try and use this season to actually finish other shows.
is it playing star wars music too
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i wasnt evne planning to watch those
besides picking up the fetish show

<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
why does that matter
but its gay
<:harold:595434251286085653>

<:obama:439779824299540491>
they have like 3 titles that are supposed to come out this year tho
there's harmonia and summer pockets (and summer pockets expanded version)
they haven't really released that much new vns tbh
same
<:15min:655058014495047690>
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
well the toei versions of the key vns are kinda special
Baba already said they're talking about making an anime for their newest VN
you'll probably get that lanks when the new KEY anime comes out

<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>

the other 2 awards from anitrendz and reddit arent any better too
since year 1
horsies isnt in it either
it doesnt deserve one but for background art
it won last year, why is it even here
this at least a better nominee then jjk cour 2
did you expect something when the jury exists out of anitubers?
still using fansubs <:Teedus:830165389950189609>
but he's not worthy being nominated as either<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
hmmm
ofc it is
he watches enough isekai to be able to watch guys
yes
cute gyaru
romcom and cosplay
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
yea she's great
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
but i can't blame them for not drawing that part
using real bgs with minimal filtering in the shopping scene sucked tho
anime toned down stuff too
always
https://storage.googleapis.com/primadoll-official/assets/image/character_haizakura_genan.png
there's also ||mecha|| apparently
yes
new KEY anime at Bibary studio
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hzgxiK_pf1s
they said since the og announcement it's a retelling of the tv-anime with a new scenario <:lul:542837203840008193>
that's why i'm marathoning tropre rn
all unrelated to each other though (besides a few)
~~Nor mine~~
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
y
i dont even think base nanoha is on there
i still don't understand your hateboner for granbelm heh
Mahou Shoujo Lyrical Nanoha: The Movie 1st
it just trades story for fancy animation
the movie has banger visuals
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cMOPbByCcls
By yours truly nana
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
oh right , I suppose Dog Days would be an option too
~~and nanoha is just a spinoff from that~~
not that surprising when triangle hearts is like '98
and the last few eps are just a director's cut of the s2 finale + an epilogue
its less sequel, more filling in gaps
(gundam witch at the end)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9pgqOflFwME
(sunday 5pm on a timeslot they're reviving)
Gundam Mercury Witch starts in October
deservingly so
no database
well its s3
think I'll finish either nnb or log horizon next
finished idoly pride was pretty aight, better final then selepro at least and real uncanny similarities. What bugged me the most was like the middle eps they just skipped all of the songs and just showed you the end result. Though the latter had much better production values.

excuse to post Song for you too (again) what a good song. 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7k7ZWXiq3F8
tbf liden only helped with the 2d scenes
imagine making originals or new adaptations when you can remake old shows
besides having tamayura
yeh same really, it's why my fav list is pretty barebones
they're part of the character she's cosplaying
it's a detail that looks wrong if you don't include it
can't forget that characters detail
it's like bikki's scar
too much details to remember for cosplay
cosplaying
bisque doll
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
fat fingering pretty bad on quotes
^
eh
the subs show the tally marks
~~trigger saving anime is like saying mappa saved anime~~
tally count for how much you were....
the ep ended on one of my fav scenes from the manga so I'm like <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
details in cosplay are very important
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>

more importantly
so they're bad
also 1:1s /can/ be good but they're not playing to the strength of the medium
eh not really
lol
the HF movies suck so
you're always gonna compromise on something
no lol
there's differences in the mediums that just dont translate well into another medium
you can never 1:1 and call it good
<:15min:655058014495047690>
1:1 adaptations are bad
good
the movie does a better job with asuna by introducing the og
that the novel didnt have either
all they did was expand on the early asuna stuff
which is good
its not a 1:1 adaptation
that doesnt change that the term is a recent thing
^
the genre isnt
the word is recent
fkn loris
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
idm the regular romcons
well the bully romcon trend is trash ye
eeh
not even the best nichijou
v good
well kyoani almost never 1:1s anyway
(also just in case i dont mean that 1:1s are inherently bad, they're just bad at the adaptation part)
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
sukebei
<:nanjofacepalm:417701492930117642>
instead of willy nilly going 1:1 and fail at what they're supposed to do
so do I but when they're adapting a different medium they can at least try and play to the strengths of that medium
good show, bad adaptation
its like calling monster good <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
but its also a somewhat complete adaptation which we should get more of but too much ongoing trash gets adapted
the ln goes a bit too hard on it
i think it was fine in the anime
taneda <:PraiseTiki:398808517139628042>
rory is great
she plays yellow
he can watch for yukachi then
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
yes you
watch for kayanon

gotta ping <@!263392442345193472> tho
yes but you know waht i meant <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:pain:848226587006468177>
19 too but yeah 2020 for precure
2019
bar 19 due to covid yes
19
the committee prolly
well a lot of money is subjective <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
and yet what they keep trying is do that
yeah and its so bad
(see 86 as an adaptation)
i was talking about the they should follow the source but also play to the strength of the medium instead of blindly following what the source is.
pretty sure we're not exactly talking the same thing yes <:15min:655058014495047690>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:pain:848226587006468177>
its like watching avengers ||final battle||
if only it didnt look so brown
<:bbdisgust:639169734117425164>
lmfao bandai is rebranding sunrise as Bandai Namco Filmworks inc.
least its still better then the spin-off
so like 90% of the anime out there
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
underboobs and hestia
well the producer doesnt work at dk anymore so eh
too bad s3 never
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
not enough of them apparently
a bit late for that os my point
what you gonna do? go back in time 12 years ago
and people call fantasy with world travels isekai now so eh
they're all gonna share tropes bcs fantasy and it sticks out more on the general hack writer kind but like aya said people wanted a distinction between fantasy and isekai so even if it's not correct cs it's an event it still happened
yeh
it is just what it is
its still a bad example
<:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
so is isekai
they put it in supernatural
nobody does
nobody even puts durarara in the fantasy label as far as i'm aware too
durarara is more defined by its mystery and supernatural imo then it being pure fantasy
thats true for literally every fantasy
but people wanted a distinction years ago between fantasy and the reicarnation/world hopping
you could literallyt call all of them fantasy and be done with it
its not useful and yet people attach it to shows
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
quantum isekai
<:painpeko:856324872913682473>
bcs its the inhabitors of the other world traveling to our world
^
its about exploring a dungeon
there's plenty of those
might as well call every fantasy that has the same tropes isekai
either way calling danmachi isekai is pretty dumb
you're just gonna find that shit over there under the fantasy labels
it generally isnt cs its not really a genre in japan
or reincarnation in a diff world
but even if 90% is the same it doesnt have worldhopping in any sort of kind so its not an isekai
isekai is a subgenre of fantasy
its fantasy
its not an isekai
danmachi has none of that
world hopping is a major trope of isekai that defines it
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
same
but it seems so yes
https://puu.sh/IHMrX.png
arent you guys watching it,m shouldnt you know?
isnt it next season?
pls
ash
oh god
don't give them ideas
what we need back is harem high school battles, I'm sure cypher would agree <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
and 2 mvs
still waiting on matsumoto's new show, the last one she did was BBB
kyousougiga <:Blessindian:792935791642411020>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
just gimme sols and some iyashikei variants and some good romance once in a while and I'm set
still laughing that it's fkn aniplex of all companies that keeps funding new Tatsuki shows
oh ye best good op (and show)
https://youtu.be/Yxg-AADx39w

just need to ignore everything after s1
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
i was actually gonna post an op but now i have to find it again
<:ashrug:558439555599040552>
i would just call them fantasy
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
hope it's charged
think I'll take my ereader to work for when there's nothing to do
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
like usual
bit prolly guy
idk
it has 6 volumes but >jp
now this one sounds like my kind of trash
https://puu.sh/IHMy7.png
but im also not catching up to other shows
not really watching anything this season helps me a lot
heh
every time i want to watch it after bisque that ones so good i cba watching more anime that day
lol dw
ive only watched the first ep <:LUL:545650745534447631>
i'll probably drop cue this season
will do but idk if ill watch 2 tho
i still need to finish s1, aya <:LUL:545650745534447631>
should continue ghost game
like ghost game
time to throw it on the pile of will probably watch
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
excuse me
fuck dpd
yeah thats never happening unless i get super ill
i do like twins the most so i hope they show up in s4
my man
fkn lanks
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i suppose ill hate watch date a live too
~~ill watch healer girl too~~
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
good thing i have kaginado 2 i suppose
ah a whole lot of nothing
https://tenor.com/view/hifumi-takimoto-new-game-anime-nervous-gif-15403687
good show tho
true but it also loses a lot in s2 ||the new people just aren't as good as kei||
oreimo was high quality too <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
with similar concepts
selection project overall better but idoly pride was good too tbh
but seriously genei is a madoka clone that doesn't know what made madoka good and tries to copy it
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
only when its dpd
i don't
too bad it was a bad madoka clone
https://youtu.be/FHugAo9EWCs

was listening to it anyway so might as well post it
xenoglossia idols (sort of) and mecha <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:okay:330354891727962122>
~~also use flash~~
first 2 wixoss seasons are pretty good, shows not worth watching after that though
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
i was gonna say gensei but then i remembered how bad it was besides the Lisa OP
~~watch dog days~~
fuck avex
s2 doesn't exist
too bad it stops after the movies
a bit more serious then the other idol shows
i suppose wake up girls is a thing too
here's an idoly pride song
https://youtu.be/7k7ZWXiq3F8

here's the selection project opening
https://youtu.be/op_ZDVVI2yk
<:harold:595434251286085653>
if you're still watching bandori i would actually finish that first
good song and shit anime is pretty basic
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>
and one of the mc groups did a new song every round
they played them in the finals but none of the other rounds
where are the songs <:BBSreeee:606130421083930628>
>have contest
>group vs group
>show group results
for an idol show
not showing half of the songs is such a weird decision in the middle part of idoly pride
it's a good comedy <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
~~no~~
pink, blue and yellow are usually the teams
cr still missing the last bit of the ep too <:Teedus:830165389950189609>
https://twitter.com/ToeiAnimation/status/1490792361521078272?t=9Eg8-VvHfHhpgIHWsRWqUA&s=19


toei.......
or so i say but ive been procrastinating finishing anime
it's on the plan to finish between this season and next season like majority of my watch list
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
yes
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
<https://anilist.co/user/Millhi/>
this is mine btw if you need more to look through
yeh antartica good
still tempted to try it to see what the fuss is with s2
instead of following the game
isn't priconne s1 mostly original boarded stuff anyway?
never watched both, can't say
it's like konosuba sort of but gacha
plenty of fish in the pond
maybe not s1
that also
<:harold:595434251286085653>
s3 is poop tho
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
and other gear va's
and horie
but it has nana
yes
https://youtu.be/W5ZIZ6v7egU
talking bout frontier, they're releasing new figs for sheryl and ranka
are you still awake? now you are
👍
paranoia sure has the best laugh
lain eh
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
you probably have months of anime to watch now at least
and those or movies ive been stalling
and Solomon
and pompo
i need to watch the revue movie heh
it's pa works so it at least has pretty good visuals
it's just over the top deaths at times which makes it laughable
that's why it's a comedy
i liked the 3 or 4 chapters ive read of asadora
would be the same thing
if its an adaptation like monster was I'll just go read the manga
maybe in 20 years
in progress
sure is
i think i started it like 10 years ago lmao
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
I'm just gonna watch dokuro angel
after that I'll bingewatch fruits basket
just waiting on that movie
that's on the plan already
lmfao
like most precure
there's a lot of shit not on my list i already watched
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
and don't say bookworm
like?
i should rewatch some older shows too
<a:nodders:796556306298830909>
so much to rewatch lol
i should rewatch the show one of these days too
<:stare:282277202060378133>
probably been ages since i read /watched naruto
the insert flashback for no reason that takes you out of the fight sure is the worst part of demon slayer
aot is just the holocaust
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
~~the part where you actually need to watch anime~~
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
^it didn't shat the bed completely for me yet but i do think its worse then it used to be, and only gets worse as it goes on. And as an animation nerd it's a much inferior version compared to the wit version. (not counting story)
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
above fruits basket
horimiya won best romance tho
which is pretty valid
it's boji from ranking of kings
canipa is one of the only one who even remotely knows how anime works
the judges decided on who you could vote
~~and thats all you need to know~~
also the judges were >anitubers
???
it's the same season but the second half they nominated
jjk won last year
Heike prolly this year
the worst fight won so not like it would have had a chance aya
<:Wakaru:834568786383994881>
(this also bad)
i think the reddit one should come out too this month?
yeh
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
nice amount of shounens tho
best boy and the oddtaxi one are like the only "good" ones
not suprising they're all bad choices
<https://www.crunchyroll.com/animeawards/winners/index.html>

hahahahaha my fkn sides
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
it's all of them
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>
aren't wolves a staple enemy
with spice of adventure
it's comfy
I'm reading the ln for it
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
he's not evil
best klk
~~then get dmd by mappa to help on their shows~~
had to resort to twitter dot com to ask for help to finish episodes (shout out to those mvps)
>covid exists too
scripts being late that pushed back everything
the animation producer going to hospital a few times
key animation
finishing boards less then a week before ep aired, finishing second KA the day before the ep comes out
everything that could possibly go wrong went wrong +1
they were still good boarded sequences
i don't think wep should have gotten best animation though
producer even
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
but the current hot shounen must win
ep 29
tropical rouge precure
even wonder egg had good action sequences
but tbf
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
don't think it would have been as good as tropre 29
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
hype fights doesn't mean it had good action sequences tho
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
even precure has better fights then jjk but you won't see that nominated either
OP could have actually been in best fights nominees
lmfao
pain
it's the worst movie that came out last year

behind the scenes berserk 2016/17
```Creating Berserk as a 3D/2D hybrid would be the only way to accurately retain what makes Berserk great visually with the resources available to these studios.

This hybridization was the goal Shin Itagaki strove for. He set out to replicate Miura's art with highly detailed models and backgrounds, but these demands caused a conflict at GEMBA. 3D animation production entails a long stretch of unique difficulties, and creating animation that replicates the look of 2D isn't so easy either. Nonetheless, Itagaki pursued his vision despite opposition from staff members concerned about his style's technical feasibility.

The result was a lot of wasted time. The premiere date of July 1st 2016 was bearing down on them, but due to so much indecision during the planning stage, they lost over half a year of production lead time. Even when NBCUniversal required a trailer be produced, they hadn't yet decided how the actual show was going to look. 

The first teaser trailer for the Berserk anime was completed in August of 2015 and released four months later in December, coinciding with the announcement of the project. But behind the scenes, the staff was finally reaching a compromise with Itagaki on how the show would actually look. The first step was to scrap all the assets they'd made for the teaser trailer and start creating 150 new character models (including battle damage models) from scratch.

 At best, we can hope that someone on the team felt vindicated by getting to say "I told you so", but the production issues that followed hurt everyone. In addition to all that wasted time arguing, Itagaki's ideas as director caused the most delays, meaning that they had less time to work on the show as the deadline rapidly approached. The new models went into production in January, and the studio finally started animating them in March of 2016, just four months before the series was meant to air.

Then a series of predictable issues followed. Not only were the highly detailed character models too much strain on the viewport in their 3DSMax software, the staff had difficulties getting these models to render at all. Without the time to find a new solution, the staff were forced to simplify these models that were originally meant to replicate as much detail from the manga as possible. The removal of lines and edges meant that their designs could now be practically animated with the hardware at GEMBA, but they also deviated greatly from their original plans for the look of the show.
The staff had hoped to render out the 3D backgrounds with Global Illumination, a system that calculates the reflection of light to create suitably atmospheric environments. But as the schedule became tighter, they needed to render out each of these backgrounds in less than 10 minutes, which was not nearly enough time for that utility. The exclusion of Global Illumination meant that Berserk's backgrounds never stood out in the way they could have. 

Shin Itagaki wanted to implement what the staff at GEMBA referred to as “touch-up lines”, the unique style of hatch-mark shading that can be seen in the final product. *This effect, along with the show's 2D animation, was created at Berserk's second studio, Millepensee.* The lines were to be automatically tracked onto the models in Adobe After Effects, but it was not always a successful process. For swords, armor, and other detailed metallic objects, the staff had to spend time manually applying the unique texture. 


```
they never even did the cgi which is the main problem with the 2016/17 version
liden did contracting work for millepensee on berserk and helped produce it somewhat
not just that, idk why kat keeps saying berserk 2017 team
no lol
don't ask questions
just watch it

i get the creepy stills argument tbf, we're going from loose, don’t care about consistency (which is great btw) animation to hyper detailed stills in the blink of an eye.
yeh the style is done very intentionally
yes
but if they are im also grabbing those
didn't order the other volumes yet cs idk if they'll also do special early orders for them

i did watch a lot in early 2010s
ash watches more isekai in a season then i watch anime in a year

on what did you filter va's? mean score?
ye
like toei on eoe
kinda dumb on studio's they're showing anime where studio's were just support for too
should watch all of them to my list tho
toei precure stonks
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

i like how teekyu inflates my sports score so hard<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
aya confirmed to not count
nana isn't even in my top 30 so it seems
it's like 3mins s1 and the others are 15mins
i should rewatch yama's, easy to rewatch
yama's good

they should count shows made by chinese subsidairies in japan as chinese <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
it's japan 100%, china 0% for me
i still haven't bothered fixing shows that are different on mal/anilist

at least they do get credited unlike sunrise shows where everything is sunrise but they don't tell you which studio it was. and the only way to find out is to check the producer.
VE movie was finished before the fire tbf
yeh
might play a part on those sequels for maido and violet
unlike before when they got credited separate
Do mostly works at Kyoani office now after the fire
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
like on heike
mostly only for kyoani shows but they help on shows from ex-kyoani staff sometimes
they're the korean branch and only really do background art
there's studio blue too but i doubt that one will show up
yes
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
ive seen too much shit with too much different studios for mappa to even show up on mine
<:worrystupid:801158437357617162>

it's basically just a factory nowadays
they used to be good at action stuff too but alas
absolute meme that a support studio is at 2

well Sol Press is "dead" so somewhat normal they're being removed
about time they did
that they did
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
cs they had to move them to months earlier then planned
the first 12 eps of the newest jojo already look like JoJo final eps runtime
yeah but all that goes to waste when someone like netflix wants to do early batches
netflix is about the biggest problem of current JoJo
and if its not on netflix
if they want to implode jojo productions even more yes
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
cgi
so its one onject
if you're drawing the horses as cgi you might as well draw the carriage attached to it in 3d too
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
besides it being one of the worst implementations
any cgi usually is <:LUL:545650745534447631>
if you really do think that, then you need to watch more anime with cgi
but they didnt?
which doesnt work
they're still animating cgi as it is 2d
they
its an industry problem
you're not wrong but its also not an overlord problem
its a pretty consistent problem throughout anime
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
overlord cgi suffers from 90% of the other cgi in anime also suffers from
the synopsis doesnt really read anything special either tbh
yeah
well i can sort of understand it aya
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
instead of the class proper
people are more mad about only focusing on 2 people
are they like just ignore the dumb changes they did or retcon them <:Teedus:830165389950189609>
sort of
i guess if its from a promo assistent it's real?

i think its just a matter of when really. I don't think they would have announced it at a livestream for the games first anniversary. Instead I would look at when they're doing lives to see if they announce something on those days.

6 tracks over 2 seasons and a movie while the other guy did 50+
they put the other one first bcs more famous even though the person did no work on the show
you would think they would put the guy doing most of the ost first and the other second that barely even did tracks for the show but not cr
properly crediting too
they're better but also worse

what was reddit ed win actually
and it won JRA anyway
so eh it probably deserves the win anyway

it has good songs so can't really complain there lol

there's 72 chs rn (tld)
ep 7 adapted ch 19 and 20
enough for 2 seasons that is
yes

yes
assuming they can even getter a commitee for it too
not really wrong tho
lmfao
all of the above, sort of
there's only a handful that actually sit in the committee for a show and even for those it's not every show
they're usually hired
studio's get paid a flat amount
doesn't matter really
licenses for streaming make up more then 50% of the revenue for a show so yes

mostly depends on staff availability and overlap I would say. There's yamasusus which very likely gonna be priotized by a bunch of staff (the producer is the same for the shows), some staff have their own shows to priotize, iirc one of the shows ADs has their own show lined up too etc. It could come soon or it could come late.

<:pepelaughpoint:698554870440919050>
kadokawa pls
bcs ????
it getting a new movie is already bad enough
<a:nopers:814840323720609822>
the problem is just htat isekai quartet is bad
better get your earplugs ready then
they're generally together after like the third ep
its rare for precure to not have the group assembled already anyway even not counting the delays
and precure is super tight on merchandise release dates
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
4 weeks to wait on yukachi precure
they're airing movie for 3 weeks instead of airing the next eps
depending if they delay it more too
older ghost game eps prolly
doesnt bode well for the other 3 shows delayed by it too
bcs of the eh hackers
they're aring a movie for 3 weeks yea
https://twitter.com/yukachiofficial/status/1502798716042104833
oof
yesn't
just believe
interesting
dont mind me its just an animation nerd rambling
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
tfw the team with the best lead in time for shows at sunrise now has 2 back to back shows when both the first seasons already we're broken.
for whatever reason unknown to man
yes
wtf sunrise
love live superstar s2 in july
and 3 eps on slow loop
just cue for me
same
but lemme finish 3 first
same
yeah xenoglossia didn't use the actual Imas VA's for the Imas characters
yeh gou and sotsu were ryushiki
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

https://twitter.com/variety/status/1504487980190208006?s=21
tis okay
which sucks cs they tend to be super fun
probably
||this a ransomware attack and toei refuses to pay||
fun stuff all around
it also messes up with the scheduled merchandise posts/releases and the holiday episodes and the movie tie-in eps
quite unfortunate, gonna be fun to see how they're gonna rewrite the show (and how noticable it will be) with the show getting a lower runtime as they're not gonna delay the next precure.
they're posting the new schedule on April 10th
now actually on precure, ep 6 is delayed for longer then those extra 3 weeks too
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
that was back for Wing btw
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
ever since bandai got involved with the merch the henshins are longer and more elaborately focused on the toys
gotta sell toys is probably more on visible side of precure
bandai just tells them x amount of designs for them to sell merch and everything else is left to sunrise creative team
```our sponsor Bandai literally came to us and said, "We want at least five new mobile suits in this series. And as long as their model kits sell...```
it's actually what bandai does to gundam
that's the go to of any gundam anyway
the only joke here is you aya
no
he was freelance anyway
source is also weibo so should be taken with a grain of salt
guess it takes a while for folks to catch up
he hasn't actually confirmed he left but he did made his own studio last year
i actually got up to date today with the show
fairly sure i know what they'll end on next week and its also diabeetus
today was a good day
86 final ep was good too
akebi was good too
ye good horny

love live vtubers
are you gonna watch the love live vtubers in fall?
my man
probably gonna go pretty standard for first half/part and then ikuni style change it up for second half/part
yeh
actual new scenes in the pv
<:PogU:915968901479804938>
https://youtu.be/gTSJPhPXdxQ
fairly normal
but pipelines are vastly different and tv-anime uses the tv-anime pipeline still and usually doesn't even look any different then it's bd releases for the tv-anime
like nobody is gonna complain about kizu
it's more in the way of how things are done
next ep is april 3
also reminder that there's no aot ep next week
anime saved
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
theres no it looks really good tv-anime on the big screen
looking like tv-anime
and why actual moviemakers have been calling out this shit practice of putting tv-anime in theaters
its shit but i understand it for GuP but even then it's just corpogreed
corpogreed
exactly why
unless they're going into spring season airing too then it might
ofc it isnt
very likely
^
it isnt going to be the end
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sol_Press
good show
i like chivalry
i would think so
<:harold:595434251286085653>
I'm still watching 13 ep shows from 2012
and hidamari
i really should finish zetsubou too
just gonna get madoka spinoff out of the way to watch the last 4 eps
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
gonna be for next time
still didn't really do catching up with shows like i said i would do
yeh
and ones a short
granted 2 of those are 4 eps and 3 eps
I have like 13 shows planned next season which is gonna be a lot compared to this one.
hope you enjoy them
only gonna be watching bocchi of those that haven't aired yet
so i wouldn't really worry
the team is used to time constraints anyway and they have a very good director attached to it that knows how to play around said constraints
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
due to that certain kamen rider anime coming
they lost people in fact
almost none
tokyo ward 24 is made by the kaguya people
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
that's kaguya
nah
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
but will those 2 shows share staff like akebi and bisque had to do
he did it before on the utena movies too
if you're talking about Kimura, then he's the series comp
but he never directed slice of life <:think_jii:688734639094890520>
he's a mecha director lol
Habara?
yeah i just hope that wont stick around either for an episode....
ye they we're decent
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i finished the last 3 eps of kyoukai this morning
1 demon lord anime replacement until our lord amos is back on tv
date a trash 4 for well we said it enough
ikkitousen bcs its good trash
https://puu.sh/IQ5Ae.png
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
next ep never comes
>show trailer for next ep
kyoukai is funny
let me see
full 2d for ?????? but in return the show barely moves
for whatever reason they're also supposed to do Witch Gundam right after (so work on that is already happening) so I expect the rest of kyoukai to be more of the same
yeah Habara is good but Kimura less so and Kyoukai is w mess anyway
which is not what they would generally do
but for this show all of those are also completely 2d
even when it was still xebec they still utilized cgi. Not for the mechs in particular but for background items like cars, computers, etc
bandais priority is always toy sales
yeh but the issues you're describing have null impact storywise
i do agree that they're putting a bit too much focus into the 2d aspect and while they could have used 3d to help with some issues they have, it wouldn't really impact the story they set out.
the problem is that the story is bland and you could replace the mechs with other mechs and that wouldn't really change anything.
the mechs aren't the problem tho <:think_jii:688734639094890520>
~~and hot girls~~
and mecha animators are a dying breed
gimmicks and insanely detailed which is where (when done well) cgi shines
unicorn is part of the problem <:Ver:704169051391524875>
yeh hand drawn is fine but when it fucks up your production you gotta think twice about it
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
kyoukai barely moves
in either way as long as the show moves I'm fine with it
ye
and iirc but could be wrong the producer for g witch is attached to beyond too
and they're on beyond
ye
but do happen to magically be at sunrise
there some peeps free and not on any current show or mecha
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
more important is the director
they haven't made it public yet
yeh
which ofc could happen
witch should be beyond unless something changef the past half year
doan and hathaway are different sunrise studio's
anymore time spend on kyoukai is less time spend on witch
we should also not forget witch gundam in the formula too
well they throw around their mecha guys to their different studios depending on the needs
i do like koyama's star driver designs, too bad the guy is stuck on trigger shows <:feelsbadman:268466745486868484>
can't help it
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
lol those newest nagano designs look like declined star driver wannabes
just look at seasonals over the past few years and compare originals to adaptations
<:sakuraweary:443271129113559050>
sometimes being too ambitious isn't good either

still love samekh
if you desire
```When you look up at the sky, what do you see? A blue sky? Freedom? A hopeful future? The people of Tokyo see none of these. Instead, an ominous alien mothership looms overhead, engulfing the city skyscape.

Three years ago, they came. The arrival of the "Invaders" sparked the greatest war humanity had ever faced—one that threatened to end the world. The Japanese government scrambled to fight the Invaders. Weapons were mass-produced, sparking controversy and pacifist movements.

That day, everything changed. And yet, nothing has changed. Koyama Kadode and Nakagawa Ouran live their final days like they always have: going to school, playing with friends, and doing what any carefree high school girls would do.

As they grow up they come to learn what it truly means to be an adult, in a world where adults seem to be demons who only deceive and destroy. They come to learn the real threat to humanity is not the Invaders, but humanity itself.```
dededede is more slice of life tho iirc

💯
it's his best show since 2011
he isn't series comp mostly tbh
yes
BRS DF looks depressingly bad anyway
ye should be that
but hey not like shaft ever aired a finished show, they have a pretty bad track record, usually it's just contained to the backgrounds
yes but covid isn't a reason to not board your stuff
no lol
not even gonna start about luminous witches
sure part 1 was servicable but the show has been a clusterfuck of a disaster
<:harold:595434251286085653>
magia part 2 is the show they delayed thrice, then aired it unfinished, then just outright delayed the last 4 eps to december, then delayed those eps to spring season as come december they hadnt even started boarding the eps and now they're supposed to have finished these 4 eps 4 months later.
<:harold:595434251286085653>
that's pre people shaft leaving
star twinkle precure tropical rouge precure :^)
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
all the rest is paywalled
only a select few will have 3 epsiodes for free available in spring season
yesn't
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
its okay you won't be able to do that anymore
new cr subscription service kinda yikes
at least the second half of death note still did something
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
the daki included is nice too
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
nice they actually drew that bondage scene in bisque 02 when gojou was watching that scene towards the end, instead of just being a white flashy scene like in the tv-airing
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
finally happens

yeah they wrapped up till ch 39, just switched and mixed the chapters to fit better for an ending

they're shafting both LL series for an ando project
sunrise's wild ride
kyoukai was supposed to be 25 eps straight before they split it
that's assuming they don't change shit up before broadcast <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
split
it's also 50 eps so not gonna think to much about it
perhaps
so we only really have 1 gundam that's apoearing for sure
the prologue ones might not even appear in the main series

who doesn't like the magically (dis) appearing breasts girl in rifle is beautiful

3Hz is good on originals

they don't have the capabilities to do more shows

air still has the best insert song
until all the backlash happened
reminder of the aot committee wanting to release the notnazi armbands
one did it well, the others a poor mans copy of it but hey the ml anime isn't real
you could play through ml and then read aot and see all the copy home work memes

a lil tad different then just changing jobs
like you just remove yourself from the industry
~~there's a reason why newbie retention rate is only ~2 years in the anime industry~~
just standing behind the counter in a 711 is gonna get you more money
any job is lol
and even then you're still gonna get shit on
but ye its just a really shitty job and you do it bcs you love it
some also just dont have the time to even do fanbox
those do pay way more
or you go into commercial/movie animation
and you will their rates if you want them to do things
bcs they set their own rates
there's also animators that earn more then episode directors
inbetweeners earn even less
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
the bread and butter of any anime
ah yes the list without inbetweeners
but  thats not something they'll ever do
if they actually showed how the industry is that would be wild
yes

guess i could watch the magia record dumpster fire cs the last 4 eps come out tomorrow
also just checked the shows im watching and literally none on saturdays
(engi was together with kadokawa and Ultra Super Pictures)
not kc in particular ofc
more so bcs shit is owned by sammy lol
which is actually fun, unlike the dmm game
there's an arcade version too
they ported the game to vita too
well no but yes
yeh
its been dwindling years after years but its still a big enough thing for kadokawa
enough people do
yes
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
their first announced anime was kancolle sequel
<:WorryLMAO:817258300902211595>
rewatch the movies when they're available
thats 10 eps in a day, gonna be enough anime <:LUL:545650745534447631>
i'm a wrap up magia record 3 after dinner i think
i also like how its 2023 cs they literally can't fit it this year bcs of all the shwos they're alreayd doing
or at least it should <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
well it wraps up the first story arc of the game
it ends the first story arc
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
what they call s3 is just the last 4 eps of s2
yes but no

FINAL SEASON PART 3
the manga focuses on the idols that are 149cm or smaller (so tend to be 12years old or younger)
(also yes the U149 means under 149cm)
https://twitter.com/imas_official/status/1510576338130051075
new imas anime about the cg spinoff
he's doing a new manga on his blog (it's on pixiv too)
```There are demons who prey on beautiful young women and possess them. Fortunately, there is a magic user roaming the city who can banish them, but he needs to make physical contact with the women in question to banish the monster. Specifically, with their breasts. This is the story of this traveler and his witch companion… ```
it's as ecchi as you can think
momibaraishi
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
posts keijo
man disappeared from his blog for a few years too, came back recently
giving him assistents would have helped too
sad stuff
they told him to end it before the anime even announced
pretty unhealthy stuff and negligence from the publisher
the author didn't get new assistents to help out and he frequently had black outs while working on the chapters
<:WorryPanic:771062677170159667>
and that the manga got axed
keijo is amazing and it sucks it never got a sequel
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
that's fine
watched an ep yesterday and closed it
but today I'm spending time on magireco 2 or at least try too
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
same for saekano and sidonia movie

you dont want to know, trust me
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
lol the start of this final ep of magireco sure had some big look at all these magical girls in our game moment
nice
ah
^for this story arc or the second one from magia record?
yeah they did for whatever reason really
<:bbdisgust:639169734117425164>
https://twitter.com/gekidaninucurry/status/1510590397927473157
changing the ending for you play the game to ||see your girls survive|| is such a shit way to end it on too
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
feels extremely like a musical
Healer girl was cute
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
and i like idols
same but its also idols
why even live
couldn't even get nana for the extreme hearts op
the only thing I'll take of tzuzuki is more dog days <:Ver:704169051391524875>
guy should have given me more dog days <:BikkiSad:497709420122341386>

ye, i know the lns did start with that too but like they had the chance to not do it
thanks honeyworks
it's a wild multiverse too
they should have cut this prologue chapter in skeleton knight
always a first time for everything
the worst part for this is all the lost progress they're not getting back
ye
gonna watch the ep after dinner
https://mpv.io/
a video player <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
mpv
whats the error
https://twitter.com/anime_shikimori/status/1512430570932170755?s=20&t=Rc_qdlcuDb0qRu2saQCE3Q
https://twitter.com/anime_shikimori/status/1512430593518469121
they're airing shiki ep 1 as planned but after that its ??
probably
according to shikimori offical twitter tweets
too many people infected with covid at the workplace
doga koba temporarily shut down
<:PogU:915968901479804938>
sometimes in the west, always in japan
2x (bd box of  6eps)
12 eps
they still do <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
every single minute of it
i hate it
idk why im even still watching this crap
https://puu.sh/ITxbV.png
same
its people just not seeding
the problem isnt the torrent client
besides the 68gb one
for smile
they all look pretty dead on nyaa
more like find a different one cs that one wont complete due to no seeders
different torrent wit hseeders <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it has no seeders, thats why
then adventure
Tamers sure is the best
the real big brain is starting from 2022 precure and go back in time until you reach futari wa 20014
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
could probably find the glitter force hacked up version somewhere tho
yeh but the show kotoko wanted to grab has no seeders and doesnt finish
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
as long as you can keep dodging
missing pieces is normal tho
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>
hopefully that one guy keeps seeding
i checked and i dont have smile on this pc to seed
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
ofc why would they put in effort in something when on the committee if they could put in effort on something when they're not on the committee
a bit like the mahouka movie but without the recap <:LUL:545650745534447631>
it's just not a good movie
if the best way to watch a movie is to skip half of it
corona
yeh until the 17th
I'm curious how they're gonna handle doga koba being closed, surely they have a few eps finished to bridge the week they're closed
romcom but the guy is the unluckiest guy ever with a cute girlfriend who switches to cool when she "saves" the boyfriend
permanent i want to die face
<:Hachipain:962701126262739024>
my fav girl so far is the I'm dead inside girl tho
I'm just glad it's not a teasing/bully fetish show
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
aots is out too nice (kaginado 2)
the outfits a little questionable of choice but i dont really think they mean something nefarious with it
and that ones actually healing
same thing different show
i don't see it as anything else then strike witches having healing magic and still requiring hospitals too
lol
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Kaginado s2 ep 1:
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
supposed to be this year
its just starship troopers <:LUL:545650745534447631>
lol that kaguya 3 ending
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>

<:LUL:545650745534447631>
the problem with ML anime is that they never finish
actually watching TE <:harold:595434251286085653>
eggs
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
would ironically be a better adaptation then what we got now
and redo rumbling hearts trainwreck
<a:renazoom:854586083911270440>
i would have just done the romcom part of ML in 24 eps and call it a day bcs seeing people go wheres the robots, isn't ml a robots anime would be funny to me
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
it can warp too
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
but hey we don't have to change acronyms so just keep it as tsf
the ishkur is a tactical space fighter, not a tactical surface fighter
the difference is in the s
Although the f-47 isn't really a tsf anymore it's a tsf
lmfao solo
<:Teedus:830165389950189609>
the side materials that are important to the sequel they're working on rn
its not based on any plane ye
it has the word tsf
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
you can see it's an ml alternative image from after total eclipse got released
i actually forgot if there was a reason why most are named after real fighter planes
they adapted the novels into a vn too
what melua said and the TE anime also just adapts half of the TE novels
~~i prefer filling up the holes~~
<a:15min:490152208827154442>
Blaming Okada is like blaming gurobutcher, most of the times they're not actually writing their own shows <:LUL:545650745534447631>
mind you IBO was in production for over 2 years before they even brought Okada on board
so basically they hire Okada for either 2 things and mostly it's the former one instead of the latter one.
In the former one they hire okada to write out the idea's of other people in ibo's case the idea's the director had.
In the latter case it's just let okada do what she wants
but okada bad
they are blaming her for those and she has nothing to do with those
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
or they go on the blame okada bandwagon without even understanding what exactly she did on the show
i feel sorry for your loss
(and yes it has aoi yuuki if that's your thing)
<a:GuraJam:757401397062008943>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O1knEeeDIAo
good show too, def recommend
sword puppets is very anime btw, its more anime then actual anime is
without him actually doing something on those projects
basically anything between 2011 (madoka)and sword puppets has mostly his name attached to projects bcs doing that sells
and before that it was madoka
the last show he's fully involved in is sword puppets
still only wrote 2 actual episodes but he did handle the general concept
more involved yea in that one
but his name is attached to the show so its his fault
People still blame urobuchi for aldnoah.zero and yet he only wrote ep 1 and 3 on s1 and after that dipped from the project
the graphics line that is
sounds normal
ye
sequel
https://twitter.com/SHAMANKING_PR/status/1517071894763040768?t=lgwYjtjtyMbjGyrj8MPswA&s=19
ye
also s1 is like 5mins and the other 2 seasons are 15min so
they can't fit 3 seasons in 4 eps
doubt
first 4 eps are compilations of prev seasons apparently
ye
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
they actually doing a "good" according to miso show for once
yama's is a cute sol
still right
no 4

final saga of 5 years
https://youtu.be/PyzxyUCRj6Y
<:Sadge:852771837946757130>
their commercials are super nicely animated and the trailer indicates the tv-anime will too but like 2mins as opposed to 15-23min eps is quite a different ballpark
i'm more worried about them being able to keep up the commercial approach for the full tv-anime
and gfl pv's already looked trash so arknights at least has that one them
and its also only 8 episodes or something
well by any means the pv looks just like how the commercial looks <:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

keep watching to find out
didn't think it was that hard to follow myself. Just that nothing actually matters.
~~it only gets worse~~
~~depends on which part of animation~~
we'll prolly see some more eps like that, show has been actively worked on since some time in 2019
based orange
with stylized cgi that actually blends in fairly well <a:15min:490152208827154442>
~~now all they need to do is get a better composite team~~

hello bandai what the fuck?
ye as is the norm
or at least trying too
irie is releasing a full musical short anime in like october or november btw
couldn't get into it,  felt like watching a worse version of sk8 without the things that made that one fun

dropped birdie today <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
and he didn't like the designs
i know a guy who dropped a sequel before it even started airing because they changed character designers so they looked different
wouldn't surprise me tbf
makes sense you would like that
at least they work as standalone shows
it's 75 romance stories with overlapping casts and also a timeline that advances
like in a nutshell
there's probably a honeyworks imouto song so eh prolly
just ignore the 50000 multiverse thing <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
heroine vgood
they still rock but its just same thing over and over
he only does one thing now on all of his series
my only gripe with current sawano is that his work isnt as varied anymore
hot

don't think they have taken down any of the lewd artwork either it's mostly the porn that's not ok
the designs can be lewd too
always good to give more girls the spotlight
need kita and diamond
same
if it ever comes to fruiton
there's already a cn and korean version so idk what else they could do besides an english release
so thats a step closer then comic girls s3 existing <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
the producer mentioned more overseas releases they're working on in that production letter they posted during game anniv

never gonna happen
from what i gather you shouldnt really expect much if its only 12 episodes
~~i have no idea, i dont read this one~~

Passione of all studio's not doing an overly ecchi show

yes
i just do a bit of everything

<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
and pay for a memoria
~~been there done that~~
yes
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i do think that would have been a better option but that means animating another 1.30min segment <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
it just feels awkward cs the op animation is lipsynced to the song
i think what they were trying to go for is that they sang the op as the second song at the festival so they played it during ed credits and put the ed song in the op
think its an intentional switch
<:WHEEZE:663901291025793055>
saori as a shota
with the caveat that those must work on shows for netflix (like vampire) or the studio has to pay back the money
the biggest investment they did was pay for wits animation school
yes
not a big one at least
nope
then netflix takes a few months to sort out subs/dubs and throws it in the archive until they remember the show exists
studios don't get paid a single penny until it's finished
series must be completely finished (~13 ep ones)
sort of
idk about vampire in specific regarding netflix jp but lol basically any anime on netflix is in jail even if it doesn't air on tv too
Netflix has jailed it for months for no reason
they finished this last year
no
yes it's been in netflix jail
Netflix jail<:sadworrydab:897198962963001434>

god i love anime companies/publishers making a whole bunch of nothing PR
it's basically an international edition with studio's from all over the world.
there's only polygon on it as far as anime goes
just believe for english
they're launching the chinese and korean servers next month
the few stellar eps are worth it but you should also not watch anything else
<:smugrista:745970250092249158>
why worried about mha when there's a lot better shows in fall
just for the awful discourse and mappa stans it will bring
well csm (might) air in fall so same
and kaginado is their magnum opus anyway
same but it has no maeda so why even bother
the mountain climbing s4 show
fall this year is the season with a lot of stacked shows but who knows how it will turn out in reality
and DIY should be fall too (altho they haven't announced date exactly)
yama's is in fall
fall looks better
still didn't keep my interest <:Ver:704169051391524875>
<:WorryConcerned:814592840642330635>

both OG and BH have problems so eh
the VN is also a shitshow to play through bcs of the up to 1000 choices
just believe
so idk what ayaya is even smoking
most of the ep actually tied into the characters
but it did matter a lot?
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
how do you even make AB shorter when the second half packs 13 eps worth of material

we live in an isekai
everything is an isekai
why is it isekai

did you
aya
<:harold:595434251286085653>
it makes sense for monogatari but lol isekai
overlord being a novel and not a ln is still funny
tends to have easier kanji too cs they're aimed at younger folks usually
the average is 50000 words per ln
well "short"
bunkobon format (A6, dust wrapper, softbacks), includes images etc
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
~~just look at kaguya~~
it's aka, i think you should expect weird
```The manga's story begins with Gorō, a doctor who coincidentally handles the childbirth of his favorite idol Ai Hoshino, who took a hiatus from the entertainment industry to give birth to her twin babies. However, just before Ai gives birth, Gorō dies from an accident, but is reborn as one of Ai's children, Aquamarine Hoshino, with his memories fully intact. ```

it's more about showbiz later on

the anime can only make it better so I'll just watch that and see how it goes
not that big a fan of aka's writing style
i dropped it after like ch18 i think it was
did goro figure out yet ||his sister is the girl he saved||
yeah its basically just a synopsis for the very first few chapters and not really any indicative of the overall story
~~but unlike on the pa works show, they're actually credited as co-animation studio on shield hero~~
good old dr movie doing the heavy lifting
good thing kinema isn't for the most part
just for kids rite
sounds like huggto <:LUL:545650745534447631>
SxF is still switching studio's every ep iirc
it's probably one of those rumor leaked remakes is my guess

can't wait for all the copium when it's not gems s2
hell no
they would get more lineage out of just continuing the story
just continue on lmao
no
he's writing 10
lmfao the sheer amount of copium these guys go through
railgun plays loosely enough with its material it wouldnt be a problem
we're talking anime no
its not if they can add it later
less isekais too
its already halfway there
just make the anime full original for railgun <:LUL:545650745534447631>
its fine
just adapt more slice of life
world would be a better place
the real plan is to just not adapt anymore index
producers: hold our beers
~~or bumrush it to get to GT~~
if you're lucky they'll slow down for NT
we know the result
so the dumb decision was to just do everything and <:LUL:545650745534447631>
well yeah bcs they wanted to be done with OT
well 3 was fucked for all kinds of reasons
i dont remember if it was in S or in T they did that
there's a contrail over her waist during the last ep
railgun actually memes her fate anyway
yeh that one felt flat on me. ange

lsd and not mentioning teekyu
and with their boyfriends at the same time too
without the girls being gay
but yeah i saw my fair share of boob fondling just played for laughs irl too
ye
it starts with  a B but its not that
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
yeah youre gonna hug or kiss on the cheek
but people you know?
not with strangers ofc
fondling and kissing is the most normal thing here
that is tho
fondling is such a basic whatever thing that it shouldnt really count as one
<:KEKW:618861779082280962>
well it should
*
eh look at it that way
yeah but maybe ash just doesnt seem it that way
well ln spoilers dont really help ash cs he's anime only no <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
they can shove whatever they want in it
tbf i wouldnt actually an op for anything
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
and im not even reading or watching it
i would count it as gay too
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
haha
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
good
so those gonna happen anyway
tbh do they really need to say something for gundam when they have that thing with right stuf for western gundam releases
yeah its not that common
well they hire a company to do the subs
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
why not include them
if you already make the subs
esp if its a popular franchise like gundam and love live
bandai has a lot of english subs on their jp bds
too late
if there's any show that should go into the dumpster fire like konosuba it's that one
god no

wild
which shouldn't have been an issue if they released the bd with a master tuned towards consumers
the hathaway bds are still tuned towards the dolby cinema standards seen in the theatres which isn't something regular monitors (besides maybe pro ones) can output
yeh based cinema standards for????
~~black scenes suck in general~~
when the night is truly black you almost can't discern any character (until shit lights up) but its only that way bcs of it being tuned towards dolby cinema standards. on theatre you would have been able to see the characters (outlines)
it adds to the watching too sort of
yeh
it still has excellent sound direction tho
unlike normal where it's just pcm or 5.1 with placebo channels
yeh sort of but its atmos you want and the movie is tuned for
flexiboobs
they could have just mastered it like they normally do
ye
cs dolby and regular have different color spaces
so a regular tv that doesn't support dolby or dolby surround or you don't have a 5.1/7.1 setup you don't get the full value
the bigger problem on hathaway is that the bd is also mastered for dolby theatre and whatnot
yeh
not really anything special or big
it's mostly black scenes
they changed some filters but that's about it
theater version isn't perfect so eh yes likely?
actual bd with "fixes" should be at a later date
they have been selling a theater version bd at theaters
windemere however has the best karaoke version of rune ga pikatto (think it was)
the phone game, the alpha game, the vn of total eclipse
which one
and yet if they just had focused on Kuro it could have been a pretty good show too <:LUL:545650745534447631>
there's quite a few movies i want to watch but I'll do those when i remember them
danmachi s4 bcs well i like it, engage kiss > original whats the worst that could happen,  Extreme Hearts > Tzukuki (failing me a third time by not giving more dog days), Isekai Ojisan > Good shit but it got netflixed, KJ File > idk its Kaiju so maybe else dropping, Love Live Superstar s2 > Idols, Lycoris Recail > original whats the worst that could happen feat guns, made in abyss s2 > sequel bait, Overlord IV  > Time to be disappointed again like the previous 2 seasons, Pantsu idol witches > Idols, Shine Post > Idols, Teppen > Looks cute, dropping if it has too much manzai, Tokyo mew mew > mahou shoujo, reboot, Utawarumono > more sequels, one of my fav vns anime probably gonna suck like usual  tho, classroom of the elite > sequel bait, Prima Doll > KEY show without Maeda.
am actually watching a bunch
i like H/A
it starts airing in like 2 - 3weeks
reboot
won't be the first or the last, just like hollywood redoing classics so will anime
oh no

it suspiciously lines up with Orange anime reveal they're doing so it's probably that at Orange.
yeah
yeh
https://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,57949/
he worked on metal gear solid
https://puu.sh/J6l1u.png
Unless he went with different penname
i don't think so actually
he hasn't appeared on s2 so you can have a safe bet his focus changed to mercury
s1 that is
one of the main animators is on amaim too
just hope its fun okouchi and not terrible okouchi but Kobayashi should be able to reign him in anyway.
for the better anyway
before staff reveal they hinted at beyond doing it
oh looks like they went for a coprod of studio 1 and studio 3 peeps, that's much better then the originally planned to have beyond on it
yes it's gorilla
Kobayashi directed that one too
spriggan drops tomorrow if people forgot

it's the sequel to the recap movies
<:15min:655058014495047690>
i guess in a sense its true cs every ep was outsourced so it costed the more then actually doing it inhouse
"high budget"
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
do an aya
if there's sales and still in stock i should grab it for cheaper
the jp bds already have english subs so its not that high of a priority for me
I might do that too depending if i feel like double dipping
yeh happy for that
but good thing for reminding me so I can actually order it
macross always has these super long ass waits for bds <:LUL:545650745534447631>
its short of a year for a bd release
bd isn't out yet tho
sequel movie

why is the official twitter like this <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
majority of Kobayashi's works are character driven too (kiznaiver, hisone) SO I actually hope he pulls that through for G-Witch too
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
but its studio 1 (and 3)  so it's at least killing hathaway
i have more hope in Kobayashi being able to reign in Okouchi then in Okouchi himself
you either get the really shitty okouchi or the real dumb fun okouchi
okouchi exists
well eh

avex is weird
LL mothers are famous voice actors liek how gear has them for villains
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
no
as a mother
nana was in love live yes
some of them dont do as much va work
or at least singers
yeah muse was from existing high profile VA's
least its not as bad as AVEX that killed wug and now that whole franchise is dead af
add more girls to super stars too for the new season and they already had a hard time using the 4 we had originally
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
super stars isnt doing that hot, they announce more aqours
they kept running aqours, announced niji spinoff, announced super stars
for no reason whatsowhever
they killed Muse in their prime
ye but like
they can't even move on
its still in 2023 which is yikes
could be a movie too
they didnt announce the format iirc
probably 12 eps ye
they're just making it a real anime
yes it was an april fools joke
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
this one should be at st8 too
they have the other project too
they have super star s2 in a week (or 2)
the niji s2 final already existed out of 80% still images
if only they would give studio 8 a break lmfao
they just announced it during the day 2 concert
yes
but its also a case of why is Bandai pushing for more new LL when the old ones still exist and are popular
aqours is still very popular
super stars isnt
they better pull a it all happens in her imagination
Yohane lead tho so good
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
april fools getting real
ye what fenny said
<:15min:655058014495047690>
but they're the low hanging fruit of manga publishers
just read up on tokyopop history lol
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
everything
they havent changed a bit
they still suck tho
they revived a few years ago for manga ye
<@171395487247630336>  new PV https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTg6gBFEN3A
usually not so visible on a first season but it starts getting really noticeable on follow ups
with this one i mean is that Bushiroad is gonna push the characters in whatever direction the fandom decides they like them being paired in
just believe
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
same studio
yesn't
it just one that works for bandai
but super stars also somewhat does the same formula
in s2 they at least try become their own thing
very true for s1 tbh
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
like me with niji
thats fair, ash
this was actually like super planned
the real joke is that they also say 2023 in the PV

posting boomer shows is a good way to post in a zoomer server, solopy
Originals usually arent worth the risk for committees anyway
Danseur is manga ye
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
Is heroine really an original when its an adaptation from music singles
Theres like some next season too but like those are still gonna play it safe too
cast list always fun to see 
https://twitter.com/kaginado/status/1540262359373008896?s=20&t=YC8MDHzBOklihkh0idr7sw
next week <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
Kaginado end actually killed me wtf
No nana opening is a strike against the show too
Just look at Nanoha and Dog days
You already know what the story is gonna be and how it will end
Extreme hearts
Dw we get Tsuzukis next trainwreck next season, anime will be saved
Gems is actually a fairly good example on how to do adaptations but theres also better more recent shows around for that. But you also still need the content.
The yohane spinoff ash
Cs they all copy that after they saw how popular it was
Just watch og LLnand you have seen all of them
Or 86
So kaguya ™️
Thanks, ill put it on my skip list
Thats like saying in yugioh, just draw the out
Idk, i think mel is onto something

Its like a bad sk8 but not that anyone watched that bcs its bromance not gay
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
yeah but a bad original still better then a 1:1 adaptation
~~it being original is alreawdy a +1 in my book~~
if its actually good better but it does look like the better of the 2 original A-1 shows next season tbh
I do trust Adachi so it should at least be a decent watch
yeah hopefully
Girls/Guns/Good? <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
The GGG of next season
Lycoris recoil
It has guns
~~but then corporate happens~~

Its literally to fund PR
That skateboard maid art is so freaking good
https://twitter.com/WIT_STUDIO/status/1542824178897887232
Unrelated though, do you guys want to kickstart poor unknown WIT studio. <:WHEEZE:663901291025793055>
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>

Thats what i said about birdie wing too
Also eh
Kek
<:MichaHee:842528677009817621>
Ye loris but its the wrong one
no proofreaders on PR team
ye
(not like it's wrong per se > <https://jisho.org/search/%E3%82%AA%E3%83%BC%E3%83%90%E3%83%BC%E3%83%AD%E3%83%BC%E3%83%89>, just wrong in the context
yeah machine tl translates オーバーロード to overload
(jp interview is tweet above)
poor folks couldn't get a proofreader for a google translated post
https://twitter.com/Madhouse_News/status/1542801497938808832?t=_maWeX3ZZVsTrTrbtudSAg&s=19
talking bout overlord
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
win and lose some eh
~~but thats not what they want, they want exactly the same~~
the anime is far better then the manga
yes thats what kaguya did
<:WHEEZE:663901291025793055>
like how kaguya has done the anime for 3 seasons
bcs it would fit better chronologically
before they adapted the chapter the week after
like kaguya skipping a certain chapter and they went wild and called A1 trash
they'll yell at you for different reasons instead
source readers are still a plague on anime tho
and then they play it safe so most of the times they try to be 1:1 <:LUL:545650745534447631>
while actually not doing anything
lots of times the author gets involved just for PRs sake too
^
meanwhile rbwy just getting the bare minimum pr from them
it's funny how shaft has been only promoting witches
but will it be as good
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
the source for it only has 3
i'm gonna watch it bcs they added a lot of exclamation marks to the anime title
oh teppen
but there's so much more spice after that
yeah thats the worst part
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
it ends mid story
the anime? yeah
and a bit closer to how the original WA1 was
bcs its like opening chapter (anime) but also turned up by eleven
same and i eternally hate the production committee for not giving us closing chapter
so that should be a good indication of how engage kiss could be
same writer after all
saekano or white album 2
also looks like a show that's gonna depend on how sappy you like drama
~~engage kiss looks like an alright romcom~~
<:whom:423625666823716864>
ah yes the madoka font countdown timer is gonna be solo leveling
~~unless of course they just gonna use the font for something else~~
yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gR73OGPvVU
still expecting CSM too in fall
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
then its already gonna be my aots
and if pte is gonna be more of the same
quite a lot of them tho have some of the best peeps in the industry but that doesnt always translate well to a good show anyway
there sure is
it really should be next year tbh
Bocchi might knowing aniplex
yama's in fall (DIY should be fall too when they actually announce air date or dont delay it), pop team epic 2 the goat etc
falls pretty stacked this year
the villains in delta are easily the worst part of delta (besides the better version karaoke song) everything else is really just regular macross though
it had dumb bs since the first macross
so something right up macross alley
to double dip or to double dip
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
the owner ghosted his own company
<:REEE:333956827182137345>
and fuck nobody saved rakudai
ye
good civ
<:harold:595434251286085653>
goodluck
86 is aniplex too so eh
<a:aWorryNinja:771065617322344500>
wouldnt advise it
anime is an expensive hobby
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
and hard to watch without knowing japanese
unlike the original releases
the rereleases are better though bcs those have english subs
so thats still in the packaging
havent done 7 bcs i dont like 7 all that much
well most of them ye
<:harold:595434251286085653>
i only buy them if i actually watched the show (and liked it enough to spend premium on this stuff)
i dont buy blind bds
yes?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
wdym i have all of the macross bds available
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
thats a lot to double dip too
nice
oh def
~~next incarnation will be vtubers (again) so it will be my time to hate macross~~
if you don't you'll hate it
but hey if you like Freya the movie is amazing
hence walkure are cutesy pop idols
and since before (and after delta) it has been cutesy pop idols
macross has always been following music trends
do you know whats in right now?
just noticed the char designs are by the kirika henshin animator (although he was AD on gear either way)
the teppen op is nice
https://twitter.com/Seasonal_OPs/status/1543227377320398848
planetarian <:okay:330354891727962122>
they're remaking extra anyway
ccc isn't
fate/extra is officially translated
H/A anime when tho
like the KA who did that scene
ye
fairly sure if i remember correctly it was done by (ex-) ufotable guys
ye anime never really got to that high again
the s1 fight yea?
~~yeah it turns into a better heaven's feel~~
in full caps
its actually ARPEGGIO anyway
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
its not but it just is
its the english short
ARP
arpeggio
john wick but cute girls working in a cafe
it was fun ye
2 years ago
whats the difference really
mind controlling disease rats or space rats
"real situation"
yeah its like 1 season and 2 movies against 22 volumes or something
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
or you would have been having aoi yuuki I-401
at least they changed the voice actors for arpeggio anime as opposed to the voice drama
its the worst non sensical part of the show and it was a lot better without it
haifuri is cute but would have been a lot better if the plot wasnt literally rat disease mind controlling humans
its not
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
unrelated but tomino related
https://twitter.com/Niallcolas_Cage/status/1543176322222112770?t=PTDEjvEzltgO4lzxGf6Ohw&s=19
not in one go, surely not
and adding a movie of the caliber of hathaway to that in 23? eh idk
which would go into 23 too
and if it follows regular gundam shenigans its gonna be 2 seasons
well witch is done at 1 and 3
yeah in 24 or later
never cypher
lmfao
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
100 years of fairy tail
trash
we just said that it has more meat to it then haifuri basically
sank like the ship in the anime
good thing they killed the show anyway
not a rat virus
parasites
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
>suara ever having a bad op
i'm listening
8 July
at least it moved pretty well during the action half but god a talking show Maruto show sounds so much better then an action Maruto show
<:REEE:333956827182137345>
oh right watched engage kiss earlier, why did it have to be action
Heh
What
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ofc why would i lie
I dont really like it either, but still was fine with the ep
Manzai Is pretty hit or miss
<@278860841485598720> https://youtu.be/3sSjXZ2sczU
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
Trigger posted it at AX, no piccies allowed
Its actually not a joke
<:wink:239129205147697152>
The meme is ded
They announced Panty & Stocking 2
Oh ye
Maybe if they upload it later lanks
Macross 7 too
Also i think it was <@954207824248967188> https://twitter.com/rightstufanime/status/1543391574561763328?t=pH4LfBZMPoP9sI_DaFZfHg&s=19
They showed it at AX
New one probs
Franz Ferdinand sure is a choice for an anime opening (cyberpunk)
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
most of the men in the upper echelons of the army have been anti-witch <:LUL:545650745534447631>
surely not <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
~~drawing animals is a pain~~
https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51pedyEHf3L._SY346_.jpg
the anime just skips over showing and introducing the familiars
and why they take animal charatistics when going witch mode
it's the source of their power
the familiars are a big thing in the manga adaptation of strike witches
the anime always skipped that
like almost 2ish hours ago
yeah a bit earlier today
it was an announcement it was green-lit yes
they havent started preproduction for the movie lol
but its not like they would have anything to show for it
i mean madoka news would be fine
but the toys still leak precures
well toei cared somewhat
but yeah companies don't seem to care so they just keep leaking stuff
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
bcs the leakers  keep using press kit images and plaster watermarks over them to tell everyone it's them
you would really think companies like aniplex would catch on with the leaks
same for solo leveling anime confirmation
its press kit leak
og for mashle
for madoka? it has
https://puu.sh/J9fLy.png
shounen series
it's Mashle anime adaptation
nope
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
not Madoka btw
but i suppose they had to show something besides just announcing more titles they will stream
and not on their own con next month
surprised they announced these at AX anyway
and all 3 of them flopped :^)
god of high school, nobless, tower of god
crunchy has done like multiple now
well maybe CR will strike gold with one webtoon anime?
fucking CR <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
https://twitter.com/tomochan_en/status/1543672169883848704
confirmed too :^)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=YvGSK8mIlt8&feature=emb_title
ye
the anime only focuses on europe
well the world really
that i do not remember
https://twitter.com/mashle_official/status/1543610516320399361
yes iirc
https://puu.sh/J9fWU.jpg
see, it's Mashle
in the end it doesnt really impact anyting
nah dont think they will now
that aniplex stream reveal is in 6mins btw
all i want is a good ML anime so never
yesn't
the usual case ye
and worse then the original
which is already better then most old new anime announcements which are like all boring ass remakes
at least it doesnt look like a remake of the old anime
it looks a bit too clean at times but thats inherent to cgi
the trailer is fine
lots of the action/isekai webtoons are adapted from (web)novels first
probably
there's a game in the works too
yeah
just not on the Line webtoon platform for the west
its still a webtoon
all 3 of the previous webtoon has pretty bad pacing problems
but script wise? idk
animation wise SL is probably gonna be fine
~~it also shows how overbooked A-1 is ofc~~
but then they also give it staff that's like bootleg of a bootleg
it sort of supposed to be a high profile title for them
rn
it basically exists out of people at A-1 that aren't working on anything
aniplex doesnt believe in it either dw

<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Akame ga kill already did that so not like we have to imagine
Just ask mom
Ye real dad
Ruri is cute manga
so hope you get a fansub
well i wouldnt touch sea subs like b-global or muse with a 10 foot pole
not enough isekai for you to watch while waiting?
just need to wait another week
so sentai is releasing prima doll at the time like every other jp broadcaster bar abema is.
Sentai failed to negotiate like they did for Kongming to be able to release the eps a week early. (Kongming aired a week early as opposed to every other jp channel, same for prima doll)
next week
strike witches x muv luv let's go
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
bvut thats the actual plot of ML aya
At the end of the op all the girls turn into an exclamation mark
Thats exactly the reason
Ah yes featuring the ED arc <:GarieHee:842528630516875274>
Which still amounts to 50 eps. They just arent one continues run anymore.
and well end after ep 12 cs 90% of the second half wasnt even worth watching
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
yeah make a love triangle
<:copium:864661425553014835>
Kai should have won
Other eps doubled down on it
The river ep was pretty tame and believable for being unlucky
Its a bit on the extreme side
I hope it does, i still want to see how much of a trainwreck it will be.
^
Kotonoha did it better <a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
Loool
Good old 90s tropes
<:Hachipain:962701126262739024>
I havent seen it the past idk 5 years if not longer
So much remakes would be better if they updated the setting to more modern times so they dont feel as dated. A bit like how parasyte updated its setting to be in modern times instead of 80s-90s japan
Curse of the remakes
More worried about everything else feeling dated

Think so ye
Banger henshin in that ep
The one thing i cant really agree with is the supporting cast being non existent
Yeh
og henshin btw 
https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/43149
but yeah TMMN reunited studio hercules members for stock footage it seems like, there's a bunch of boomers on the new show that worked on the old show.
he did do one of the special moves https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/188726
he did work on the og, not sure if he did do the og henshin
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
too much sega humor for you
Hs, subsplease, same thing
You need to use fansubs yea
Netflix has it and its a 2 week latecast per ep like how komi was done
Isekai ojisan wont be for another 2 weeks no?
<:lul:542837203840008193>
And here i was hoping it would be that isekai with the triple different release

There's wikis that actually spoiler all of that stuff so you have to click yourself to spoil it

last ep delayed bcs of an axe murder
School days too
it happens
<:15min:655058014495047690>
the show about assassinations
lycoris recoil
no way lyco isnt gonna get delayed
lycoris seems pretty dead rn, just need to wait for that to be delayed/canceled
https://twitter.com/teppen_anime/status/1545317935333249024
(it featured an assassination plot)
Teppen ep 2 is canceled (re-airing ep 1 again saturday), continues with ep 3 on July 16
the action looks good but that's it
the first half of the ep is much better
it doesnt
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
it wouldnt have a action focused second half then
>romcom done right
<@171395487247630336> Prima Doll is out subbed btw
Nah, its bunbun and pripri was by Kuroboshi
Idk if someone is going to comic con.

They were clashing swords at random intervals
Its also the prime example of too much talking during a fight.
spend too much time talking during a fight
before it turns into the wost possible way to do action
let them talk
dude they got the talking man writer
At least theyre not stuck so thats a plus
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d7Di8LWQRl4
when is the best ktk song coming
they're not challenger levels of bad but they get pretty close at times
there are literally no good aniplex subs after 2011
its aniplex
cypher
it had english subs included too which makes it all the easier
ofc
yeah bd came out yesterday
sao
They should have just let him write his stories and vn and then get someone to actually trim it for anime adaptation
It did but you can still feel and see the switch
Maeda writes them as not anime for anime which hasnt worked for 3 times now
On originals ye
I dont even think Romeo is involved too
<:MichaHee:842528677009817621>
So will I
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
A key show without Maeda isnt worth watching
Dw thats just to prepare for ml trash next season
Lycoris is airing btw today
Looks better in general then the authors candy store show
The composite is trash tho but everything else looks nice.
Its ex-shaft members <:Ver:704169051391524875>

misaki actually brainwashed cypher
didn't want to go for the (wo)men angle

so gamers <:ikkib:235621294920433664>

i was just thinking of a polygamy

would you watch a show where 2 girls are dating each other but they also go out with the same guy?
still can't believe it's passione doing that one
Never
Haha
The actual ending of the show was fine imo, its the eps before that ,that needs changing
Eh
yes

so far
she only hurts herself
i guess
a bit too much
she sure is fenny
ch 4 is butts i think it was
and the nfor some other chapters you gotta read raws
first chapter is armpits
second chapter is (smelly) feet
<:15min:655058014495047690>
like Kaguhara's Fetish Notebook which is exactly what you think it is
i read trash too
based on covers
actually think the stuff you pinged me for is pretty diverse
lol
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
im just making a joke bcs you posted something with big booba again
your bad tastes are showing
aya pls
Just wait till they animate the next arc
he finally added the best character too the series ||notChar||
progressive is just a side thing
yes bcs his main focus is on the main sao arc
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>

one piece collectors are people with real taste
Lol our import tax is so low that buying 2 lns triggers it
French market is still bigger then usa for that so not suprising
We pay more just bcs of import tax
Ye well true
Just your seed things i suppose
Its the setup of the arc
Its literally on the back sunmary cypher
All of the worlds colliding sounds like fun
I should actually read more of the newest arc
Ill dm it when im on pc
Dw im not gonna post it
Cypher would love it tho
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I would post a pick of saos notChar but that ones like an actual big spoiler
Same
I prefer had alicization design
Eugo will appear in one way or another
Everyone appears again that arc
But like
<:MichaHee:842528677009817621>
It has notChar
It doesnt
https://puu.sh/JaoVe.png
looks like a better vote
On a fkn movie
They cant keep it consistent and it melts multiple times
It hurts aria movie quite a bunch
The OS style is just soulless and sterile
I mean animation style lol
Og series had character
Its just soulless
I do like it too
And the og series is better anyway
I should watch the movie but its w/e
<:wink:239129205147697152>
Starts reading the ln
Cypher reads 3 chapters drops it
I can already see it
Ayaya and ash read/watch like the most isekai
Why doesnt it surprise me its an isekai
Brainrot
Before that we basically got all the stuff they released in france tld to dutch
Until kaze shutdown their dutch division
We actually had it pretty well like 10ish years ago

They should have still finished witches, they delayed it bcs shaft machine broke regardless of rwby.

<:LUL:545650745534447631>
way better then the over saturated purple and yellow scenes
the lights are overkill but it works
mind you they do some okay night stuff too
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496650964384743434/997290989083447406/screenshot-0025.jpg
the DoP his work on vanitas (same person as here) also looks miles better
less saturated and actually composited
on monogatari it looks good
she do be hot
the aesthetic is just bad
i do like the story
its like that every night scene
same thing here
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/496650964384743434/997290989393805322/screenshot-0054.jpg
you can literally see the characters on a different layer
not even composited
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/496650964384743434/997189895317626970/unknown.png
normal colored bg with a too high saturation purple color filter on it
yes im sure
the ones who know how shit works dont
normal people like it
thats a disconnect between people who actually know about animation and who don't really
it doesn't
i would have liked call of night if it didnt look like vomit
Yes
<:UcchiDisgust:621889306797146133>

Is america really that split though. Its gonna be like 85% crunchy, 5% hidive, 5% netflix and 5% any other

They're announcing the dub cast this saturday afaik (assumed you we're talking about gunbuster here)
Banger songs
Xam'd is cool
Akino is great
<:MichaHee:842528677009817621>
We get plenty of shows like that now anyway were some folks are invested (whether its good or bad) and magically appear on a show when it involves said content
Spoders cool

Watch teekyu so you're brainfogged and then watch HI-EVO

It is october lmao
https://twitter.com/diy_anime/status/1555101230631997447?t=M15QXaVHNQ9tEvLlHc6DtQ&s=19
she could have worked well as makima too
Fairouz as power is a power move too
and Llen for ggo
yeah
she tends to be too cutesy
Tomori is just a weird choice for Makima overall
there are some that would make sense like maaya as Makima etc tbf
casting newbies for the leads is a fairly interesting decision too.
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
hopefully not like the actual jjk eps with the bad bg works
yeah
I do think the coloring could be better to pop out more like the volume covers do but eh it's servicable
if its any indication is hard to tell with Mappa anyway <:LUL:545650745534447631>

It never ends
The show became before the mappaplosion
ye and the enemies are different race instead of japanese
the anime is doomed anyway
people are already mad they're gonna follow the japanese version and not the korean version
(cr expo is happening)
but yes it;s real
dun think the author has much say in it when the committee says yes <:15min:655058014495047690>

engage kiss has some really nice nun shots this ep
the wn was still ongoing for a while so idk if the ln actually had a proper end or how they ended up doing the ending but i'm not gonna watch it anyway
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
it is
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>

<:FubukiCursed:674325372795617300>
yeah they watch demon slayer and jjk
japans pretty crazy over baseball anyway
the guy is essentially always right (as much as he sucks as a person to even get those details)
he makes more mistakes on what type of content it is then being mistaken if a show gets anime or not
its safe to assume it's real
eh he's like 95% correct on leaks
good
contrary to what people believe though it's not done by a symphogear animator
I've only watched the henshin for fuuto pi <:LUL:545650745534447631>

<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
if you're story is an isekai you have like a 90% chance to get anime anyway
yeah
the guys awful but he gets carried as a god by anitwitter for all the leaks he gives
there's been multiple PA's that came out that said they got harrassed until they gave out the deeds
good thing they don't, what he does to get them isn't pretty
<:ashrug:558439555599040552>

https://twitter.com/onimai_anime/status/1557894636139450368
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
A diomedea show that doesnt look aesthethically fucked up? God damn wild
https://tenor.com/view/borat-borat-very-nice-verynice-thumbs-up-gif-25080066
the first half of this engage kiss ep is summed up as
~100chapters they didnt animate yet
no its only 2 more movies
Just in asia and surroundings
They still havent released that globally
Now if its like STR im just gonna laugh so hard
Mcdemons 2 is d+ exclusive and yet cr has the intl release for it
I dont see the problem anway
The new anime gonna stream on d+ but no mention was made if its for jpnor global
It can either go the str or mcdemons s2 route and yet everyone is losing their mind over the str route when it could also be the mcdemons s2 route.
The bleach news is so funny, sure the leaks say d+ but we dont know if its d+ japan exclusive or d+ intl. <:teedus:774534056594767882>
you just had 3 new ikki tousen eps tsk tsk
https://puu.sh/Jg9q9.jpg
lmfao
damn this teppen ep is just the endless 7
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
just in time for electric boogaloo walkure 2 in next macross entry
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
not that they can, they don't plan for them unlike re:creators
too bad more shows dont do re:creators style recaps
barely leaves any room to breathe
they went from 1 project per aniP or no project on an aniP to 2 projects per aniP at all times
lots of aniplex productions are fucked in all kinds of ways nowadays anyway
based bisque
~~by the better show~~
and they couldnt air it less then 3 months away anyway bcs timeslots were taken
those 3 months could have been avoided if they properly gave the time they needed
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
just like the ln!
s1 is a good standalone tbh
86 was extremely lucky to get ishii as a director
okay you can actually see the cracks in s2 but not like a person that doesnt know how animation works would be able to see them
bcs even with all the issues, the show still looks good
i dont think the recap was really needed
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
anime watchers cant remember
it has been a few months, pls understand
ye
aniplex wanted it to be their next heavy hitter but then they gave it none of the resources
instead of it being half a year before delayed broadcast like originally planned
cour 2 needed another half a year at minimum
yeah
even
after they delayed cour 2
2 is entirely to blame on aniplex
s1 did manage it alright
it was a fair dumpster fire production wise yes
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
they have historics on the show, would be weird if that was the cause
heh the movie
or the anzio battle they had to shove into it's own ova later on cs they didnt had time to do it in the show anymore
recaps are as old as anime itself
i mean before 2010 <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
eva?
its pretty noticable in s2
debatable
they only cut into runtime for the next show lol
yeah but thats just your regular bd bonus anyway
and it rocks
recreators is one of the few shows that had a planned recap that was used a a break between the 2 cours
that was still an unplanned recap
no
(they were unplanned)
if it was unplanned it cut away an episode
its still 1 season split into 2
ok i won't
86 and 86 part 2
tbf aya's right in thats the way they have been advocating 86
eventually in like 70 year or someit
funny how its the exact opposite right now
yeah <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
you'll see it on new shows <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
the staff shuffled all the time tbf
maybe not beyond besides some staff that went on witch but i think that would be a good indicator
yeah
studio 1 and studio 3 seems more likely as those are their 2 big gundam ones
yeah bcs its their 2 biggest anime franchises lol
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
putting studio 8 with studio 1 would be weird
i hope they did tbh
<https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUC13BU40T10C22A7000000/?n_cid=SNSTWB&n_tw=1660422634>
its on nikkei, paid article
just removing the name sunrise and merging the studio's are meh decisions.
I do think White Base was a good decision tbf
tends to be just a floor or a few floors of a building they rent
most studio's don't really have a whole building for them
its like a studio a floor
they are rented buildings
and acted as 7 different studio's within sunrise
before the new one was build
yes but the new building doesnt matter if 7 studio's were already at the same place in the first place
each studio had their own core identity which is now gone
which does make it a tad easier for inhouse stuff
It just puts the outliers together with them now
me neither but its a shitty move to do. Most of their animation talent was already in the same building anyway before this.
just a bandai moment <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
I guess that explains why Witch has such a missmatch of staff from 3 different sunrise studio's <:LUL:545650745534447631>
https://twitter.com/Char_Tweet/status/1558652191874875393?s=20&t=OoOdGDPrsPyAd92iwkzmdw
>The 10 sunrise studio's merged into 5
~~if they announce a new one at the live, yes, but also probably yes~~
it's also way too late to even do script changes <:LUL:545650745534447631>
it feels more like him replying to something he doesnt understand
i think VIZ had aod before that
they bought it and shut it down last year
we lost aod to cr
but AoD had more and also had actual typesetting
ye
used to be a german anime stream service
and Mezzanine exists but idk if amazon feeds the file uploaded through that to you
like i said AoD used too before shutdown. Amazon also has a high bitrate (or at least used too) that would be good enough for BD quality if they actually hosted bd content.
also a straight rip would still be better then a screen recording
thats outright wrong, they do stream bds. Cna't help it companies like AoD are dead that actually had super high bitrate streams.
eh that ones just a decent weibo rip
manga version just has better art with murata doing it
manga version of garou arc is inferior to garou arc in the web version
that ones understandable
But Saito still did amazing work for it on 2 and he loves opm so I hope he can sneak out of JC to do some cuts under nc or pen name.
Opm 2 was fine tbh, people overblow the animation part a lot bcs it didnt have the highs like s1.
Like the actual problem in 2 was how awful the editing was done.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
You'll get a second part to engage kiss instead
They were cute in s1 yes
https://twitter.com/tsurune_anime/status/1560484418023608321?s=20
Bold to assume lycoris will get more
but they're freelance so they show up on non KAI shows too
they are on the idol show this season too (Shine Post)
uma musume
well that and every other KAI property the studio did after XV
I havent checked the credits yet bcs i'm not watching Fuuto Pi
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
half of the staff
yeah a lot of Chisato's moves come from movies
luminous good cartoon
https://puu.sh/Jhhwv.jpg
not that im a fan of this trend anyway
least the movie should (hopefully, probably not) be good enough
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
is it louise x princess?
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
well minus stuff like the s2 ending and whatnot
the storylines are the same ofc
Fairly yes
<:lmao:836084071502970880>
Which louise <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>  ln louise is competent, anime louise isnt
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
or at least it should be one
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
it's a split cour show
they haven't actually announced it yet, will happen on the last ep i reckon
oh its not eh like in anime spoiler
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
spoiler but eh ||it's gonna be 24 eps total||
they're not even halfway through the show lol
engage is pretty fun trash
yeh
the writer <:KEKW:632364419640328223>
i'm a content man
expected WA shenigans, got undiluted maruto
but im enjoying my undiluted maruto content
yeah but the show wouldnt work if the mc wasn't such a sleazy ass
but yeah the bickering is the best part about engage kiss tbh
the extra rush from the schedule that went to all fuck probably didnt help
and 86 is cr
shouldn't be, she works with sentai
like x word actually meaning Z instead of Y whic hyou had written on the script
and even if they sometimes send the script beforehand it might be different when you actually watch the video
gl getting something to tl and to edit and to qc if they send you the masters just a few hours before broadcast
yeah but at least for seasonals that would also have to be changed not only for the western companies tbf
a tl having to do its own editing and qc is just asking for problems anyway
and separate editing
fansubs do have the qc though
~~as long your show isn't tld by jennifer you're probably gonna be fine~~
and take the old tls for granted
official tls tend to get shit on bcs they are different then what people read from poor tls
old fansubs were dominated by speed subs which were far from hq
<:harold:595434251286085653>
>hq stuff
>old fansubs
:^)
at least as fansubs you wouldnt have to be on standby at any given time to tl a show
they wont go back to fansubs
quite a bunch went fansubs > legal
most of them were fansubbers lol
~~to compensate~~
and they do other work that pays well
they have said this multiple times
because they like anime
cr getting the funi rates would have been a lot better
both options suck
either they took the lower wage or get fired
they did get worse
or get fired
they even went as far (when the funi merger happened) to change the rates those tls had to the lower bracket
there's a whole thread on twitter about it, tl pay sucks ass for them
which in return helps them to see what shows they should make
Industry people like kadokawa have full on access to their data
they do even if they don't give money <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:Ojisansmile:999653450579185704>
like other companies have been doing lately for theater releases
Funny how CR who is funding yuru camp (so I assume the movie too) can't bring over the movie early
Akane back would go against gridman anyway

Chisato will be fine
Mercury
even if a new tsukihime anime gets announced
and its never gonna end
(its a running joke about tsukihime anime btw)
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
all i can see is that they're airing 12 eps of anime unknown
what is this empty tweet
its been a thing since before the pandemic dw
it's easier on them to just split 24 eps seasons into 2 parts then get the second half of the rails super hard
it's super dumb but that's current anime production.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
i think it was clear as a day
so that doesn't fit either
(There are people that are saying its the external staff that have covid but then the externals are also popping up on upcoming eps and eps this week for different shows)

its funny how the past year we had like 3 shows with heart problems

<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
its just yer average mid 00 series
if you just ignore that there's a source for tskuhime then the anime isn't all that bad
it just doesnt exist
the anime is fine
which one og fate or tsukihime
kekw
you start wit hthat
w/e it was

the first fate anime is 20017

I was gonna say they don't but they do <:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>

i give them a minute
just change your settings
the fight scene in the og anime is better then the movie version <:KEKW:632364419640328223>
os is when they started going for the clean lifeless aesthethic
animewise
ordinal scale is the start that ruined sao
Well replay it
Same
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
So i can complain if they fuck shit up
So i went ahead and play the game
Its getting anime but i dont trust it after how bad the rewrite anime was.
Its pretty good too
Based key making sad family vns
I did summer pockets reflection blue in my vacation 2 weeks ago and its still finding its way in my brain a lot
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
Case in point
Depending on when it airs next year ill prolly watch it anyway
I saw the pv earlier and it looked pretty mid
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
If both aya and ash like it ,it lowers my expectations
and then s3 is filling in gaps
s2 is just a recap of the movies and s2 is a sort of sequel
i like yuuna but its a lot of wasted potential tbh
cs imas and love live exist
well define good
its wild to think that there's only 18 eps of content in 3 movies and 3 seasons <:GarieHee:255583679332483072>
~~like best girl~~
now to wait for the last bunch of things to happen
was fun
Utawa is good and long too
Pls
Heh
just keep in mind that a lot of retelling happens
s2 covers the movies too
you can just watch s1 s2 s3
before they announced s2 that explained it
or the ln adaptation that went a bit more in depth
which meant you had to have read the bonus materials from the bds
and the yuyuyu final sucks pretty hard without more knowledge
the prequel movies are the best thing of yuyuyu
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
so have fun
and all of the gacha is canon too
which isnt really a good state for your multimedia project to be in tbh
you could basically do like 3 movies > s1 > S3 first 6 eps  > s2 4 eps > s3 final 6 eps + the epilogue it provides
but as a directors cut
and then second half of s3 is just the the final eps of s2
Bootleg teppen <:pog:515960701484007453>
as expected of ash
<:Ojisansmile:999653450579185704>

yeah it did

Hope it finishes its run without problems too

<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
idk whats worse, ufo genshin or rental s3
Its a concept trailer so not really representative
mind you they said sequel, not tv anime s2 <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
same but I also want Umehara to get a break for once the poor guy
well bisque has an event today unlike yagakimi
but its not like they dont act in character anyway
idk i havent seen a single live
or you could just torrent the bd versions of the lives <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
i wouldnt watch them myself but they'll probably still do online viewings
<:think_jii:688734639094890520>

Still worse then his gridman output though in the end
I still think in a vacuum ikrs his ep (6) was the strongest of the batch
Yeh
Imaishi only worked on ep 10 funny enough
They could actually slow down a tad tbf
Speeeeeeeeeeed

Dont forget about the other movie related to this

Next season is already leaked though and besides they already set up ||on how he will survive||
Yeh gonna be a nice final next week <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Every ep can be chisato annoying them
Yeh lilybell spinoff doesnt sound too bad
Engage kiss 2
I think you mean the superior show
Bcs it doesnt exist
The previews are just the voice actors shitposting
Well different teams and producers

And every show shaft has been doing the past 5 years has been a reminder
It would just be beating a dead horse
Why would there be?
Today too with Toho
Im sure aniplex would do that lmfao
It was a 13 eps done deal for him
Im just not sure adachi wants to do more.
Its not toei that masters bd with the wrong color spectrum <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
https://twitter.com/MON0EYE/status/1574049064571789313
I need to hunt down the tv version of the prologue at least, they added more changes to it.
Im not optimistic about it
Right
I wouldnt watch an anime with that happening
Not that gainax animated a single episode.
3 months to get a board when you're still working on other eps is pretty bad
And something in the lines of he wrote it 3 months before broadcast of said eps
Re eva ep 25-26 discussion from earlier, T. Okada (gainax co-founder) stated before it wasn't just a problem of budget or time, but that Anno simply hadn't written the ending.
Comes with a frontier short too if you want to see those 2 again. (Was uploaded in a separate torrent)
Yeh
Bd released yesterday, rips are out
utawa is servicable at least tbh and consistent, mla is just pure garbage anime adaptation
I hate it
Yes
Cote also sort of did that iirc
I wasnt even disagreeing
^
The kiri henshin was just suggestive
Gear showed people naked in s1 anyway
Probably on some forums too
Ofc
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
Either way its from shounen fans so they're probably just mad he drew invis girl titties
Drawing a 15 year old (and lets be real thats 90% of anime girls) is a bit different then owning real child r18 picture books
Like the rk mangaka etc
People are comparing him to the pedo authors
No
Ill never understand fanboys
And people are apparently mad the author did this ??
Yes

Hope its good
(and a breather to mappa too bcs jjk s2 is now also inherently delayed a season so they also get 3 months extra to work with)
But im sure G witch will be fine for the most part just by them bruteforcing it and Waki doing his magic so the casual viewer doesn't notice.  And the break will sort of give them a breather too.
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/496650964384743434/1021459956798595102/firefox_2022-09-20_01-36-20.jpg
This was the AD count (19) on the only ep of cote s2 that moved this season
~10 ADs are fairly normal nowadays on productions but its not exactly healthy
Realistically speaking you just want 1 AD, maybe 2 if you split up A-B parts to 1 each.
Then sometimes you also have some final eps (like kyoani ones) where people are just free of work and help out with some ad duties.
And then you have the production derailed so hard you have to throw a billion people on it to get episodes out on time.
Anything above number is pretty bad
Animation Directors
(gundam movies generally have a high ad count by nature so not including those)
The prologue already 30 something ADs on it so we might see the same for some eps too
At least not directly visible, they have Waki too and he's good with compositing to hide cracks in the production.
Most likely is that they'll just throw a bunch of ADs on the eps to keep it consistent.
Hopefully not
I have no hope either way
Heh
https://youtu.be/_MdNEjLtmeA
Finally done something right
Looks like it
<@279341087494242304> https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/496642828068192260/1025012729272074250/20220929_135432.jpg
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
its good news for JJK s2 at least, this gives mappa an extra 3 months
So they made g witch split cour to save it and added movies edited into tv to fill the gap
Theyre doing this bcs g witch production has been a disaster
Just feed everything through mpv
Lucky enough I never had to deal with the cr player even when i used free trials
Back when they were with ellation and had the vrv player, when i used it i actually liked that one. And they could have just used that player which was functional but instead opted in to a infunctional one for cr.
That also
But they maybe have 10-15% of their catalog available here (havent checked for a while) and thats just not worth getting a sub for
Tbf I would if they actually had shows available in belgium
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
Cs they don't tell you
They rotate anime you can watch for free rn iirc but dont ask where the list is

I understand CR prices going up but why are funis when they're phasing it out
Also lol

On one hand fuck demarco, on the other hand f for the people involved and fans.
Credits will tell enough
Your loss really
This isnt anything new
Gundam has a history of production issues that are well written down?
Or get blacklisted
You cannot really doompost it on social media if you dont want to lose your job
By actual people working on the show like blou/fede that are in several discord servers about sakuga
Probably planned, they announced it after s2 ended
Lol
I checked and gundam.info does use youtube as player
But something like what Melua said seems more likely to me.
I can totally see then doing that however.
Bit late for that when the rights were already negotiated
Should be airing on CR too and everywhere else
Yeh
Wild they're postponing it on the prime gundam channel tho
(it should still be on CR)
https://twitter.com/WTK/status/1575875273005768704?t=IzeUvR6JFY-6KVKCMtYjhQ&s=19

Ye
Nobody liked wonder egg by the time the final eps came around <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
People like them and want a follow up even though they ended fine and dont need anything more
Same
You're not the only one
And havent bothered watching more cs the series is so bad compared to it
I just finished the first Ichigo eps and it reminded me how good an MC she was and how good her series was
Still havent finished it lol
On parade was pretty bad too
After stars
Bandai......
Aikatsu lost a lot what made it cool and fun the more entries come out
Very
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Yes
Yeah but should be all things ironed out before. But its youtube so maybe not.
Like how official gear on youtube got copyrighted by KR
Could be well bandai themself too
Postponement could be anything from hours to days tbh
a shitpost anime but an anime <:LUL:545650745534447631>
its very much an anime
its pop team epic s2 opening
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gslrTP0CrK0
main series is wrapped up right now but they can always pull something out of there ass like the past few series
next entry is actually just a spin-off
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
stil lcan't believe fafner is still going on
good ep tho
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
after that i gave up though at the 15min mark
https://puu.sh/Jo6cC.png
go to like 148k or something
its just the english one fucked up
their other language verisons work fine
CR (english)
time to watch the rest without subs <:LUL:545650745534447631>
(the subs fuck up at ~15mins again too
his comp helps so much
Waki still based too
yeh
the production IS fucked up
35 key animators and as much nigen (second key animators) on the first ep alone
i mean
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
need to add another 135 0000 delay
they show up at 11:01
<@213645184125239317> the subs get fucked up at 08:46 again
its a digest version of the music video for the song (Also they should make it the ED animation  either way)
no
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
the placeholder op is gonna be better then the actual op
<:okay:330354891727962122>
but yeah if you plan to torrent it to watch it with eng subs add a 12500-13k sub delay
<:15min:655058014495047690>
cn is just a fancier jp
same thing
yes they are
>jp
yes where its delayed
https://puu.sh/Jo67b.png
need to add a ~13k sub delay to sort of properly time them
<:okay:330354891727962122>
cr already fucked up the subs
first ep of witch out
he also did the comp for the 8th ms team bd box special short
he wrotes a few eps for it yes
<a:kekdisco:704018044950806608>
but its not his first foray into gundam so he prolly knows what to do either way
or sk8 okouchi
or eh code geass okouchi
valvrave okouchi
well depends on what okouchi you get still
okouchi wrote the utena lns ye
lmfao
at least ln wise (utena) the script was done by the same guy
nice utena parallels
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/233856718889680897/1026109245206310983/unknown.png
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
they should keep it though its too good to stay used in just the mv
yeah probably gonna happen
imagine we just get another yoasobi song as ED <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
https://puu.sh/Jo6If.png
yeh on the website
I would love if they keep it, it would be such a good fit as ED
well the animation is linked to the song which is the opening so i'm not sure
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
like you
i do think it still fits for ed animation tbh
<@145705908716961792> look they released the full MV
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3eytpBOkOFA
okochi wrote a short novel in relation to the opening theme 
https://g-witch.net/music/novel/
they did help out on second key animation at least
thats even more effort
i was gonna do that but effort
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
they have enough yuri baiting on LL so maybe they'll change it up for gundam
neither is bandais for that matter
would be nice if they do but i don't have that much hope for it
same but we'll prolly never find out
yeah iwas gonna say okouchi is the screen comp/ script writer but looks like iski already has that covered
~~sentient robots are cool, looks at xenoglossia~~
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
lol iski
the novel only reinforces the idea that aerial is sentient
With Aerial telling Ericht she should do her own thing instead.
then again its just about Ericht growing up seen through the eyes of Aerial (sentient being) and how the mom wants to use Ericht as a tool of revenge.
would be nice if they put up a translated version on the english website of g-witch too
yeah!
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
Everyone in shambles
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
Sutella loses next ep, losing her groom status
Looo
Oh wait its not waki himself thats the main DoP, its his long time understudy so he has the same aggressive comp style as Waki, will probably have to wait to get a before/after when Waki shows up to help out the guy. <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
I just hope waki gets clearance to post some before/after shots from episodes
Funnily enough they didnt do the cgi inhouse
Nichigo is a different timeslot, birdie wing 2 airing has no corelation to this

Apparently they already shortened it compared to the ln
The plus side is with it out of the way the other eps prolly be better
I very much disliked the first ep of sword isekai. It basically amounts to 20 mins of exposition they could have done in 5 without any loss.
Its in general a change of how they usually work tbf.
That sounds about right from what I heard too.
she is ye
yeah lol
Worth it
its ok her wife will save her
yes
?? part 4 at least moves
part 6 looks way worse then part 4
~~can't look worse then part 6~~
thank god
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
might as well just have used his real name at that point
lol at the creator/concept/whatever of the show using a penname though that basically everyone that knows something about production knows tho who it is
I wouldnt mind that
the pig being named meat and them eating pork and then showing a terrified pig is such a good bad gag
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
the name puns
and re witch i would probably just hunt down the tv rip for the prologue
Fugo <:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
<a:popcorn:618126773514797106>
i'm mostly afraid of akiba maid war fizzling out too soon but hey even if it does, that first ep is gonna stay fun to watch
(you're talking about short 12 i suppose)

He did cool stuff in s1
The first ep didnt had the french guy segment which sucks
Ofc
But then i also got a webm script for mpv cs movement tends to show something better then stills but I also don't do that enough.
I dont screenshot enough
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
i havent even finished the special, ive watched it halfway and closed the ep
wep > bisque > bocchi > bisque 2 (next year)
mostly thanks to aniplex forcing them to have multiple shows at the same time
the guy is gonna get into the hospital for long term if he keeps going like this. Can't think of a single show at clw he did that had a healthy schedule
eternal aniplex suffering
granted there's also stuff i adore like yms which technically is an adaptation from a manga but it has more original content then actually following chapters
same tbh
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
love genki yukachi too
love the girls
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
and like pancreas and liz
thats just tamayura and sequels
no
it is understandable cs the movies already quite stretched out but it also sucks they sacrificed that part
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
the one thing that should have been animated was a slideshow of stills
love it, hate the ||date segment||
i havent really added much to favs

its jsut depreswed k-on and its good
but god is that shit
least they're still managing to keep the AD count low so less errors in terms of correction
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
love how there was practically no robots in the ep and they still had to use 35ish KA and 2nd KA
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

Meanwhile Dellings line already gets memed

looks enough in true bleach fashion
yah just not sure if its split or continues
cs its 52 eps so that final fight will be 24 eps
so you know pirates pirated it
it wasn't supposed to be but disney put up the ep early
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
They already killed the nsfw stuff soo

Then again g witch being a mix of utena and shakespear aimed at a younger generation is funny
I would expect suffering but not to the extremes of some earlier entries or other okouchi shows
``> YOASOBIさんやPARCOとのタイアップに関しても、今までガンダムに触れてこなかった若い世代の方々に壁なく入ってきていただけるようにしたいと思いました。今のカルチャーを担っている人たちの力をお借りして、若い世代に向けてガンダムを広げていくことは意識しているところです。``
They got yaosobi and stuff bcs those vibe with the younger generation and might get them to watch it
This is an excerpt that talks a bit about g witch being an easier entry

``　「日曜午後5時という時間の放送ですし、入り口からあまり重々しくするよりも、入りやすい、見やすいというところは意識しています。地球と宇宙の対立のような話が描かれるかのか……というのはさておき、これまでの『ガンダム』のような地球対宇宙、国家対国家の戦争は、若い人にとって実感が湧きづらいのでは？と考えていました。重い、人が死ぬから見ないという人もいらっしゃいます。今の10代にとって入りやすく、身近に感じていただくことを意識しています。ただ、『水星の魔女』にも転換点があり、『PROLOGUE』でもあるような穏やかではない話も描かれます。やっぱり『ガンダム』なので」``
>producers talked to teenagers
>If it has the name gundam in the title we won't watch it
Producer interview for g witch
There was a whole segment where they talked about how teenagers dont watch gundam anymore <:lul:542837203840008193>
From interviews they did it seemed less suffering related
<@279341087494242304> CHOMP
It worked well enough kind of their motto rn for the adaptation
The ending scene is the cake tho
Did wish they put a bit more character acting in the cockpit scene but it was mostly good suffering
Ye

Power is great
But next ep should have the balls scene in csm which should be a pretty  good indicator on how they're gonna handle the comedy.
which might be how the overall adaptation will turn out to be.
yeah with great comedy sprinkled in between and ep 1 was pretty devoid of that. it basically kept the funny lines but not the underlying comedy that came with them.
it's very 90s and 2000s written
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>

Fun times ig <:LUL:545650745534447631>
the original plan was no break
thats still true
~~and depending on your knowledge of animation production the first 3 eps already had pretty bad jank you might notice or not~~
they have been showing up on totally unrelated not mecha shows instead
Actually asking their veterans for help cause those has been surprisingly absent on all 3 eps so far.
You know what would help too?
Like with seeing those credits it makes perfectly sense to split cour it as an emergency.
those are things you tend to see on long cour final stretch kind of episodes, not the first few eps
having so many people on a show as far as the very first ep indicate severe production issues
i really hope that you don't believe them having 35-45+ KA and 2nd KA with entire studio's attributes to those roles too (so in reality its more people) is for fun and not because the production is such a mess they *need* everyone to help out.
the split cour are true
it's not really uncommon to finish eps just before broadcast
2 weeks btw
japan loves dubbing movies
might be getting one later
ep 2 even better
The classic
There's at least a new gyaru yuri starting in comic hime ill prolly read
Same or more yuri in general that doesnt involve just baiting
If you don't believe its never happening

what a good cartoon
more fmp at xebec <:copium:864661425553014835>
same tbh
and thats bcs it takes place in the hometown where kyoani is located
hibike eupho is like the one exception right now
they just haven't done series that aren't published by their book imprint
yamada isnt at kyoani anymore but that wouldnt be a problem
and kyoani doesnt look like they would wanna do it
as long as its not kyoani i wouldnt want anyone to even do it
when they are fucking financing the show
bd aside, how is cr not streaming it yet
sol fans keep on winning

<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
again when gundam would have been in pre-production
and his assistent director was saving 86s ass from falling apart
the director was directing another show while gundam should have been in pre-production
but also major staff was busy on other shows too
the reorganisation probably had more of an effect then moving into WB
yeah
basically handles every and all filters
ye
special effects
and other effects
guy in charge of all the sfx
director of photography
maybe why they went for this specific DoP. Their style makes it look premium and hides animation shortcomings.
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
I'm so proud, finally an ep with les then 30 KA
https://puu.sh/JpI7I.jpg
Taiga picked it up so it should be out
Gonna grab breakfast and watch the ep after
Should be on cr soonish anyway
Oh 9mins until cr
40mins until cr or something i think

<:coronacchi:715163819177017395>
People expecting every studio to have dop to like ufo are eeeh anyway at most you'll get Waki school DoP if you really want that ufo feel anyway
Lol that sucks too ofc
But that sort of stuff also gonna depend if you actively follow animation or not.
The bleach stuff is funny to me bcs while it looks "good" the show itself barely moves (more then the old series) and utilises animation shortcuts all the time, they even looped an action scene last ep lol.
It's not what I would call good animation.
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
if dr movie shuts down basically more then half of the anime industry is gonna fall flat on their asses cs they wont be able to outsource to them
(ie pa works show)
most of them time they will be just in credits as whatever support they did ignoring the fact that they handled bulk of the episodes themselves
shield hero  nd that other show were an exception for that actually crediting them for co-productions
they never get enough credit for what they do though
its one of the biggest support studio's in the industry

Killer wotagei
The lyrics of the op/ed are so good too
and on bisque
they happen to be on bocchi too
there's only a few big nerds out there who really like drawing folds
they tend to simplify them
clothing folds are up there with animals that animators don't really want to draw (same for hair strands and whatnot) just intricate details that would make the job much harder for them it has to be.
and clothing folds
this week wednesday.
i really need to power through prev season
i've heard good things about the first bunch of this seasons mha animation wise. unlike prev season
folds are truly the endgame of anime.
yes
how many moving folds do you want?

i'll do it this way
well fuck you discord for embed failing all the time again lately
very blessed avans
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/496650964384743434/1034509252091449424/yamacoaster.mp4
so good
and then there's also always diy
can't say i disagree either but my other show also besides new avan was all recap so far, so with next ep being new it might switch around again.
the op and eds
they're all in universe songs written by bocchi too iirc
<:LUL:545650745534447631>

ye
https://tenor.com/view/berserk-gif-9980507
same for hair details and whatnot
you can easily spot them cs an ep will have a a lot more folds compared to usual the chars would be drawn in.
ep was entertaining, first bit of action was pretty meh though. I applaud their efforts for keeping that in 2d mostly too but that would be a part where using cgi for the fodder suits actually would be a boon. The duel in the second half more then makes up for it at least. and obligatory still too much KA comment here too <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
ye
tbf if they had actually done the first 2 vns too it would have helped tremendously with the arcs in alt.
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
that too
at least the eps are better then s1
yeah
Also yes, not at the start but these are problems pushing back an ep a week doesnt solve and tend to get worse and worse over time, it might not be visible for casuals at thr start but depending production you could very well noticable see it.
It was 2 cour originally internally before they changed it to split and went public with that using the pr move of a year of gundam. Which people seemed to eat up like candy.
Bcs they already changed it from 2cour to split....
Its only not a problem bcs they already had the timeslots after winter lol
But also yeah very understandable tbh, The less you're aware of things the less you'll notice issues and I said it before but their DoP hides a lot of them too. The funniest one to me so far was the mom in the phonecall from ep 2 or 3 which was just 4 sides but they added ghosting to give the illusion of rotation, instead of actually animating the movement. But also fret not after having watched todays Bleach ep I can say that ones worse off in the end.
I did <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
But they also have 3 months of movie edits they can use if they run out of airtime <:LUL:545650745534447631>
And ep 5 was a pretty good tell they were behind with the ep as they didnt upload a ep pv days before hand like usual.
Ive been saying it all along tho
Its been fucked since ep 1
Hahahahhaa
Recap
https://twitter.com/G_Witch_M/status/1587278379979448320?t=chEL3s2ySzAww47CIvMaZQ&s=19
Vivid is bad, vivid strike is bad, strikers is both awful and decent depending where you're at. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> 

Not that detonation/reflection are good movies but they're better then the above.
But im also not sure what they would even do.
Force is pretty dead, strikers movie maybe...
I honestly think nanoha shouldnt touch tv anime again.
Its been 2 years so any time now <:copium:864661425553014835>
Only that tweet
Idk where livechart got that vivid one for
Its not vivid tho

<:15min:655058014495047690>
Yeh 2020
Theres that nanoha anime they announced in 2020 lol
Like they have internally foreign staff, wouldnt be that hard to get those to read through the english.
Would be a shame if they hadnt tbh
Ofc its a bunny puzzle
Tbf i might have tunneled a bit too much and should have also rephrased some sentences to be more clear.
Thats what I remember too, and im from belgium so yeh
~~fairly sure neighbouring countries too~~
<:okay:330354891727962122>
Nightshift
Its also 6 am for me and going to bed soon, i feel ya
I gave a funny anecdote of 1 issue and i also praised the DoP doing such a good job masking the issues
I dont think i actually ever said the show looks outright bad
??
~~True which is a problem cs its those that dont read credits also start spouting production nonsense~~
I would argue otherwise seeing the credits are available during each ep so pretty visible somethings amiss
It does lol
How is the visibility a massive overstatement of issues when they average 40-80 key animators (including second ka) per ep? Which show there's a giant underlaying production issue at hand? That are numbers you shouldnt even see through the course of a series tallied up. And witch has been doing those since the first ep.
Lmao
first half was super strong and the second half was strong too.  Aoi's mom is so good <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
i would psot the full ep here if i could, loved every second of it.
but yeah ep 5 and for the remainder of the season is all new stuff now.
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
its basically watch the stuff before the op and then just skip till the ed to see the nice paintery aninari images
(and the eds too)
but each recap ep also had a complete new avan thats worth watching
oh definitely and the later 2 recaps don't really work that well (cs the show was already a longer duration)
maybe not all of it but ye
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
you should have been watching the recaps too
new stuff
god bless that yama ep today

i should watch the ep
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
My fav parts in the ep are the vending machine scene and the puke scene
Its just 3d assistance but final result is all 2d
Nah it was 2d
good performance too

then again its not exactly making the demographic they are aiming for funnily enough. (based on jp stream trackers, so don't know how well it's doing on the day time slot in nichigo demographic wise)
that
same thoughts derek
Yeah bcs its male insert  pov and not yamada pov <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

Thank you Yoshida too <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
~~you can even appreciate the k-on anime more after you read the manga and realize how terrible it actually is and how much heavy lifting they did for the show~~
Either way both k-on and bocchi actually enhance the anime unlike most other kirara 4koma that just play it straight <:ashrug:558439555599040552>
also people bickering about diy, bocchi and akebi about who's the best.
me: god damn bless the yamas

At least for the introduction of said girl ye
Its a pretty fetish anime

spoiler tagging just in case, key visual features naked men (and a woman)

There's an interview out with the cd for witch gundam. (Assuming mogumo is female)
-Mogumo got asked by a sunrise employee to participate a competition for the next gundam project. (result is clear who won said competition)
-Her concept design for Sutella was more akin to a commander personality (total opposite of what she is rn)
- Uniforms are based on foreign military academia's, when worldview was decided she added SF elements to it. 
- The pants are the directors idea
-Mione wasn't part of the school so didnt had an uniform. had a more revealing/skimpy ladylike costume early on. Later on she also got reassigned to be a student so they had to redesign her clothes.
Her hair is in contrast with Sutella's hair (mione's hair falling down, Sutella's being wild etc)
-Elan was designed to look like a prince. He just had problems early on adapting the school uniform to a prince like look.
-Shadik took the longest to design, wanted it to be japanese and aloof but also had to match it with Guel and Elan.
-Chuchu's hair wasn't as big originally.
- She only had the name for Chuchu but nothing else when starting designing her. her name reminded her of scrunchies so she thought about doughnuts and other stuff...
-Nika was designed as a very standard character to balance out the unique personalities of Mione and Sutella.

whatever they do for a next series still rather have Ash back then going ahead with Go as mc

what zeon is talking about is this btw

you have to press a button to go to said channel
gundam airs in a special timeslot anyway
it doesn't, the prime channel it aired on MBS/TBS nichi-5 didnt air golf
so no they didn't air a special bcs of golf
and the schedule for the golf always seemed to have it ending at 16:54

yeah true but at least we got the va's for shinji , gendo and asuka
ye mb
happens just before the twinning.mp4
||they had popuko smell which floor A/B  was titan ex on the regular XIV soundtrack playing over it||
it would have been better if they included the first part of the gag too
done with pte 8 and watching 9 now and dying at it being pop team evangelion
next weeks should be good too ||bocchi yamcha pose||
that segment is one of krr's favs
yeah they waited for this ep to air to post the interviews
even has the god awful haloing

i still need to watch last weeks ep cs japan trip but i'll do that after this stream im watching is over
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
but then they also keep giving him action shows
Granted he also said that action isn't his forte and rather does character acting stuff
Kobayashi  —How much of the project was finalized by the time you joined the staff?

>The biggest change to the story after I joined the staff was to turn it from a battle-heavy work into one that depicts what’s in the characters’ hearts, the sort of thing Okada-san specializes in.
It's Kobayashi that changed it into the character drama it was
director can easily change the whole setup of the show. he already did it before on kiznaiver.
Okada had it as a battle royale mind you.
it's team effort
don't forget the director too, this isn't really a 1 person thing.
depends on when she plans to return probs

<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
good or bad
anything umehara produces is a watch for me anyway
what arda said and also included for me is staff behind a show.
lets say you have 2 generic shows from first glance, would be more inclined to try out something done by Shingo Natsume then average joe director
Kawamura producing, no time for lesbait <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>

(ep 4 is pushed to dec 15)
its also delayed <:ikkib:235621294920433664>
but it looks like the comments think like you (and mostly why i posted it)
i wouldnt really expect a s2
for now
just an exhibit

<:PraiseTiki:398808517139628042>
But hey final ep of cour 1 is now on my birthday so i can now eat cake while watching suffering in gundam
Bcs it wasnt mean to be split originally
But the golf never delayed it
Yeah as far as i remember the interview correctly.
so chance is higher then you think
Otsuka already said he wants to animate all of fujimoto's works
i still vastly prefer the chaoticness of Fujimoto <:LUL:545650745534447631>
Not sure the anime will change it that much then tbh. Granted it is less chaotic and has a more realism style but it's still pretty mean spirited.
Tis good, still dont like the presentation
<:okay:330354891727962122>
yeah in ep 10
yeah think so
they do air code geass re-air too iirc just before g witch
well nichigo is anime only timeslot
I try my best not to dw
The golf tournament that day was always scheduled to end at 16:55 but that wouldnt really have been a problem anyway even if it got extended
i knew it was gonna happen the moment teacher said it
<:FeelsBadMan:515961405082697748>
That would ruin the namepun
yeah, prolly good time to start finish reading it too
<:okay:330354891727962122>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
as the sole committee member they could have just outright given more time, that's true.
well yeah, they havent finished douga for ep 12 yet and that's in 3 weeks lol
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
well it's not any different as how Mappa has been operating the past 5 years so not sure what to actually comment. Just throw more people on it and get the ep done in just time is their base modus operandi for a while now. (It's actually a worse bodycount then g-witch). But yeah there's little correlation between that and them being sole committee for the show.
yes
ye

yu serizawa as rae and karin nanami is claire
yeah they're showing  2 compilation movies of gridman and dynazenon before the new movie comes out.
End of the year sucks for day time anime.
maid war: you didnt just do that.
Prod IG and Khara collab even
Which is fine? People get what bocchi goes through and also get a laugh. This isnt supposed to be your super dead serious just like irl counterpart <:ashrug:558439555599040552>
~~yamas 4 this season still better then both~~

he looks so good too
https://puu.sh/Jun5s.jpg
yeah twinkle takes time to get going but when it does it goes hard and it just has that kind of emotional end of season type of ep that i just love
that's also true.
i just tend to say start with whatever one except hugtto and one of the sequel seasons.
or wait for new precure to come out and start with that
yeah
but theres also like 40 eps of drag in between
the final bit of nodoka arc was pretty neat at least tbh
heavy reliance on mid season cure too(which is to be fair also an issue in other precure shows but it was way worse in healin' good)
that is true
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>

don't expect too much, it's just a 5min short anime as far as i'm aware
next week gone be fun
~~just wait to see if they bundle a kit with a bd and just buy that instead~~
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
maybe i'll get some gundam kits next year if i have spare money
i have a lot of plastic in figs but not actually in kits
sounds like a good waste of money
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:15min:655058014495047690>
wouldn't be complete without also getting the man himself as a fig tho, which at least they're doing a rerun for next year.
<https://myfigurecollection.net/item/1671249>
i eyed the kit before
thats the white orange one with the cool looking wings right?
riot if he's not in the movie
they should actually add Laura to other precures <:Ojisansmile:999653450579185704>
Tropre is great, granted it has less focus on overall story and more focus on just being an energetic comedy but thats Uchida for you.
fun contrast with shouta aoi as mc
pop team epic s2 btw, touya
Most surprising thing coming out of jump festa this year.
Never expected to see more aonoex.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gmV4O0y7zqk
a whole series of chungus castle robots  does sound fun. Maybe they'll do that if the project catches on.

Wizard spiderman
The description got me confused until i clicked the characters to see alternate names
i'm legit interested
What do you even mean with a thin production or production quality problem? And hopefully you don't mean character art when replying.

There's a bunch i agree and disagree heavily on but those stand out.

I do agree somewhat agree on the backgrounds that it has lost some of its flavor but honestly? The photorealistic bgs were actually integrated better then some of s3's, like ep 10 (i think it was) which stood out way more. I wouldn't expect more of the former in case we ever get more yamasusume, The director is a photography nerd and basically every bg you see in the show is a picture he took irl. (And yes he and the staff also did the mountain climbing themselves to be able to portrait it as good as possible)

There's more but I need to take a shower first and typing on phone is a pain
Well so is anilist for that matter really
Seeing as mal is owned by japanese companies
Mal ratings probably matter more then anilist in terms of engagement for japanese companies.
Fkn cygames

rumor but wouldnt be that surprising if it happens
i want to say yes but its moppers so i am gonna say no
<a:aWorryNinja:771065617322344500>
Heh
Final final soon
Bumping it up half a score bcs it has uma musume <:LUL:545650745534447631>
Its not much but something
Current part is a bit better then previous part of utawa at the minimum
Developing characters isnt an important aspect of anime <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
They did that enough already so thank god
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
I wouldnt diss the games
Anime
Havent watched past <:keks:936231610850897992>
I should finish mla s2 but its just a drag
Thanks dr.movie <:AkiBless:727899991854678037>
Bout time
well bocchi at least finished the final 2 days before airing <:WHEEZE:663901291025793055>
japan viewers just aren't vibing with nakayama's vision for it
yeah
csm anime is doing pretty poorly in japan
luckily enough we do have a few shows once in a while that finish way beforehand.
Mob 3 was finished in spring
DIY was finished early thsi year-spring
YNS4 was finished 2 years-1year ago bar endings and opening
it has been a bubble ready to pop for a while
like how they're having to watch an AD standing up at desk so he doesnt fall asleep bcs he's been at work for hours end.
like csm isn't really publicly known unless you follow people on the production that are tweeting some cryptic shit
at least ones publicly known <:LUL:545650745534447631>
Cs all we need is more 1:1 adaptations /s
Just got to pick your poison.
Western fanboys who act like mappa is god or japanese antis who are bullying/assaulting Nakayama on twitter, with them also making a petition to send to Mappa to remake csm with a new director cs Nakayama doesn't get the vision and is a poison on the show.
Saw this too yesterday. Anime production moment... But this is a good showcase imo on how bad the production is going (not that people will believe it, they dont believe it for csm, let alone g-witch). 13k frames even if its just in-between/finish-up outsourcing is an insane number to do in just 2 weeks time. (This is for ep 12 so seasons final.)
On the other hand you're probably looking at a dense action packed final which could be cool.

(He says csw cs using csm brings in a flock of rabbit fanboys you would rather avoid. Although the japanese antis probably worse)

Edit: episodes finishing just before broadcast is all too common sadly enough which is a general industry problem.
Bocchi 🧎‍♂️
so prolly around that
looked it up
started in 2018
not sure when bocchi actually got serialized tho
yeah krr has been a fan since the start of the manga iirc
you should go to like 2017? i think it was for older bocchi krr animation
the char designer, main episode director, the guy who they pitched bocchi anime too
krr does ship bokita <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
heh
yeah shipping wars in general suck tho
all i know is that the gyaru got bigger boobs in the anime or something
heh
<:KEKW:632364419640328223>
And it on abema for onimai so could have watched it live yesterday
Not the full ep
Oh i just have the op/ed shared to me
Do post here after you watched the goods
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I can dm them to you
Yeah and the op/ed while being very good animated send you straight to jail.
i like how Kon herself did the singing voice for the fake op too
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
it's just nakayama's csm instead of fujimoto's csm and both are good
but i do think it's a perfectly fine choice to have landed on.
yes
(i dont like nakayama's style that much either for csm but i'm not gonna assault him or call for a remake of it)
they rather have the manga chaotic cinematic style
but people dont agree with his cinematic realism style he decided on for csm
yeah thats the whole point of nakayama as director
csm actually moves super hard
bleach
but bleach does look stylish as fuck in the current style.
it's mostly slow pans and back and forth flipping and minimal movement in general. 

I'ts like the exact opposite of >*insert sol anime this season here*
and if you can get more eps like ep 6 that sounds good enough to me
but i dont think anime viewers gonna care that much, they just want to see everything animated, whether arc is bad or good
yeah
but we're still in the start of the arc was actually okay phase
prev ep added some stuff kubo wrote for the anime but its mostly either skipped chapters or panel adapted
nope
granted that depends on what you understand under well animated or animation in the first place tbh
~~its not well animated tho besides ep 6~~
i would be more worried about bleach fans then fmab fans <:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
source purists 😦
<:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
6 months..., see you in 2030 for the final ep
<:NozoHeh:356677866534207489>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
yeah staff bias
<:copium:864661425553014835>
did you know that in the final ep during the live, ||in the manga it's actually all of them that cover for Bocchi, while in the anime it's Kita only||
The chinese workers maybe did
Well this time the excuse makes sense
Its 75% correct <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
<:harold:595434251286085653>
So you know eh fun whether its real or not.
The reason they cite is video segment ordered from china would be late for broadcast due to rising corona over there.
(ep 13 delayed isekai ojisan)
<:coronacchi:715163819177017395>
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>

why not k-on college too
- Mx0

- Mage and Demon Queen

-More yns

-more Saki

-Zero no tsukaima remake (still with kugirie as louise)
what a difficult question
would be awkward when they got all of the hathaway team to help out to get the ep finished on time and then not use Okiura for a tailormade scene for him<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>

<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
yea
and by that they had to move her outside of the venue so they could avoid congestion. <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
bocchi mangaka winning at comiket too
<:harold:595434251286085653>
MT had the fancy names cs those are people working on onimai
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
They had this show in production before MT even got announced
Yeah but its less of a studio thing and more of a people thing
Guy just returned to his roots
Might have been less if you didnt get watanabe as op ep director tho
Wouldnt have been any different if you still got immr as the main guy
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
Its a majority of the character acting specialists lol
Its just immr leaking through
i did hear takagi gets better over time into actual romance but it doesnt take away s1 is jsut the same kind of fetish pandering <:ashrug:558439555599040552>
nagatoro, uzaki etc
i just don't like female bullies a guy kind of romance
takagi is the worst romance ~~bully mc shows just suck~~ from this year, let alone a top 10 contender in anime.
arknights was kind of weak 
Uncle literally isn't even finished
I dont even know why half are in
i wonder how the movie is doing, right mappa <:LUL:545650745534447631>
Well yeah
Like what?
They used the show for their 10th anniv promo too but idk what they even would show there
Its a weird thing all around for being a co-production and yet not actually doing essentially anything
There was like an mappa affliated ep director on one ep but thats like it.
Yes
Nothing
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
Or i should say not involved
My fav part of the show involves mappa tho
Ye
First ones on bd but idk when second one is on bd
Waiting on the (re)cap movies to be out
Ikuhara is someone who really gels with longer runtime shows to tell his tales
He also loses a lot by 12/13 eps too tbh
Won't disagree either
At least what ive seen so far
Yeah
Wish he showed up for the kappa show but he kind of busy
Been promoted to assistent director duties and higher after that show
And script for ep 16
Mostly as KA iirc
He worked on that one too
The biggest difference between the 2 generally lies in the characters itself.
Ye
And Ikuhara is his mentor
And it would make sense too, Furukawa co-directed yurikuma
I think you're pretty spot on
Shabadadoo
<:RubyRun:356978448977231872>
I have a bazzillion love live tshirts tho
I have a few
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
I have a kouko tshirt i wear
Fantastic op tho (gamers)
Understandable
Misunderstanding the anime
~~i like gamers too~~
Yosuga no sora also up there <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
But ye for romance probably eh
Tsuki ga kirei > just because > amagami ss
Ghost banri sucked out all enjoyment i had from the show and just dropped it
Lmfao
Remove ghost banri
Golden time was such a step down
Most romance anime also just never move in general tbh
Tsuki is just really grounded
<:gachiW:647758000710483977>
Make separate studio to focus on fujoshi shows cs they dont want main branch name on them.
Dont make new shows with said studio cs they're all too busy on other shows
Its a shame they essentially killed their side studio
~~the side characters are also so much better characters~~
it has the same problem as a lot of romance do, 0 progression for xxx of chapters before wrapping up at the end and then comes all of it.
depends on how much they plan to adapt tbh
Best scene bisque #8 (beach part)
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Love louise and saito
Wonderful scene
Its based on a scene you find from the first ep of the show
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
The only problem is that holos naked on it
Speaking of fantastic romance anime
I should wear my spice and wolf tshirt more
<:AsukaFinger:743895649379942481>
They didnt announce delipre either until like day it started airing
Likely gonna be late announcement
Looks like it
Ye
What a coincidence
Lmfao he apparently also does the music for tomo-chan? And that show airs right after tsurune 2.
i think he did the music for the recap too?
the recap movie adds a bunch of stuff for s2 but ofc that one isnt out yet on bd (until end of jan) and by the time it does it won't really be needed all that much anymore
they actually showed up for longer then I expected in this ep <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
~~it has girls~~
dw i'm watching it too <:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
I play azur lane, im on a list if i want it or not
Not as bad as the op/ed probably?
white fox
Atelier Pontdarc is a split group from WF but seeing as how that's going with their oji-san adaptation i'm pretty eeeeeeeh
which did surprisingly looked decent for the losses they did suffer
the only thing in 22
utawa
next you know lidenc*cks also do the next rezero <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
funny tho wf keeps losing all of their shows
you know whats probably gonna be a groundbreaking? not using an in-house director
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_iMzdyYRPrk&feature=emb_title
netoge for one
they had good looking trailers before
i mean its still a trailer
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
not the i only did a few tracks and take all the credit composer
the actual composer
Feels very close too,with how macross apes music trends.
<:ADAM:338363978797547539>
Its ok, next macross will be vtubers so i will have my time to hate
It would have been a nice thing to explore
It exists but doesnt matter which sucks.
Same for the mirage stuff tbf
And just watch ippo or ashita no joe if you want boxing
If they ever decide to do more with vivid strike i might rewatch it and see how i like it now
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>
Vivid was bad and vivid strike made me fall asleep
Oh i dont really have input here
<:GanyuDisgusted:849650325417623623>
I havent seen strikers since it aired though so im very fuzzy on details.
I honestly want to say both
Timeskip (theyre adults in strikers)
I found both nanoha vivid and vivid strike awful.
Thats probably first movie or As she was talking about. Strikers only has tv-anime.

The movies are their own continium so not like majority of that list impacts order.
Movie 2nd A's > reflection > detonation.
If you want to keep up just doing the movies.
Yuru yuri
Like cod mobile skin and dmc5 robo arms
Does a lot of more normal mechanical designs too. (More for games at least)
Yeah
Are his designs
Zephyranthes and Physalis
Optimus prime, ratched, ironhide, prowl etc are all his designs
Diaclone (am i saying this right?) Precursor of what became transformers
His story decisions sometimes not
I like his mechs
Dude just wants to draw mecha
Although I would love it if we got more statements like the Watanabe one about Kawamori.

Sort of macross relates too
``Watanabe: I’d worked with many of these people on Macross Plus so I just called them over to work on Cowboy Bebop when the offer came. Except for Shoji Kawamori, whom I didn’t invite but still showed up.``
(And kawamori does this multiple times)
I was gonna say believe in kawamori but the one thing you shouldnt do is believe in kawamori
Ye
Vtuber idols and you will like it <:KEKW:632364419640328223>
Haha
(granted its probably the best character acting moment in nanoha lmao)
<:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
https://www.sakugabooru.com/post/show/111291

Soul
Just watch As movie
The scene is rad
The reflection and detonation movies are fairly weak but it does ||end on another satisfying punch||
~~hope the new nanoha anime is nanoha too~~
~~there's a reason why they went back to nanoha and fate lol~~
lmfao dude get some rest
https://twitter.com/LoveLive_staff/status/1611348230998003712
KRR solo KA
It does but they only wrote it in to handicap the og cast in just a bad way. But yeh politics yada yada.
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
<:wakaru:571478205903667230>
I still need to hunt down some nanoha force figs, mid manga but love the design
Oh def. More and more over time too.
~~give me more dog days you cowards~~
Or maybe im just getting too old for tsuzukis crap
The story just feels like he regressed more then 10 years and the animation probably did too.
Different series by same creator and studio
But also with how terrible tsuzuki's and seven arcs, extreme hearts is, maybe for the better then dont give more nanoha
We just need to wait until they realize they did announce a new nanoha.
Iirc kaneko was president? Of witch craft after he left media vision, who made the games and produced them
Yeh
Battle of aces and Gears of destiny
https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/nanoha/images/1/1b/Gears_of_Destiny.JPG/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/200?cb=20120123170708
Ye psp
Psp iirc
Now play the games the movies we're losely based on and circle around to kaneko who produced them ^ ^
The actual villain was so awful tbh, actually dragged down the movie for me. But ||the punch was very worth it.||
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
You'll see soon enough.
<:deadsmile:462617142731341827>
Shit char
Detonation has the dude
i see you are at the best part of the episode
I would have been better if they just didnt use the game cgi.
Game is good ofc
Anime ofc lol
Nier: not gonna put too much words into this. It's bad and all of the 2B butts they draw aint saving it. 

Trigun Stampede: Not finished the ep yet but this is fun. Really expressive to boot.
that show is getting a s2 so i would say it didnt commit enough sins
more importantly then nier. Misfits 2 ep 1 did what the show does best. Anos in a deadpan voice being a badass.
well 2 and ggo also mostly did that style
not story
animation wise
it actually had soul
s1 was the best sao ever looked and you can't change my mind
its like tacking a 2d design on a 3d background and call it a done deal
its the mixing thats pretty bad to make them a whole
the art is actually consistent
nah
its so visually incoherent
its just the game models
its already sad enough they didnt make their own cgi stuff
Here you have the game cgi (without the blur to mask how bad it looks in the game) + high density character designs (when not too much in motion) and a shitty brown color palette.
yes
sao is a1 and as soulless the newer entries are, the visuals are actually coherent
there's still a difference
Also even (and hopefully it does) changes course. That doesn't change how incoherent everything visually is.
he works on nier, im sure he can leak me some stuff <:KEK:739953921895694417>
i should ask mister unnamed
<:15min:655058014495047690>
only for taro to correct them to say its just your usual bd upgrade visuals
the animes official twitter said that the bds will have a special yoko taro cut.
and taro also said they yeeted him from the planning
first ep doesnt give me much hope for that 😦
how they handled the hacking minigame in the anime was pretty good tbf
yeah which means if you dislike the hacking mechanic you should just watch the show <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
if she doesnt fall over her cape at least once im gonna call the show bad
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
mid season precure baby <:BikkiKappa:241175652554899456>
but yeah he's basically the aikatsu character designer
You an sort of tell on the "villains"
you wouldnt even be able to tell in superstar as his designs got overly corrected to look like Murota's designs (og LL and sunshine char designer)
<:KEK:739953921895694417>
wasn't supposed to be up yet
animate released it early btw
(good show btw)
https://tenor.com/view/aikatsu-ichigo-hoshimiya-anime-idol-uniform-gif-26460917
i'm dying
they really do just be looking like aikatsu
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j0DUgBhsg_A
next precure announcement is up
https://www.animatetimes.com/news/details.php?id=1673101971&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social
goes for most fan projects of shows i liked tbh
i don't tbh
👴
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
its gonna influence your decisions a bit when 1 studio maybe has done 20 anime and you watched 3 of them or when a studio has done 500 anime and you watched 300 of them.
jc staff is HUGE and that also adds up
also like
they did
now that they actually have in-house staff they are more consistent
it just feels that way bcs A-1 solely relied on freelancers

<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
all the screentime they will get this season
😦
the girls in those shows are super cute too
<:copium:864661425553014835>
ippon was indeed nice, got me laughing with some of the cheesy comedic timings too. also reminded me of when i did ma back in the day.
Was on the fence watching it but i will watch first ep then
Oh cool
Precure pilled brain
Only anime you need
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
well based on the first nier ep i would say the maplestory anime was indeed better
Maple
the better one
waiting on my video game menace to have its ep released
<:okay:330354891727962122>
more time for me to not catch up on other shows
yeah
i loved the lil bit tha tstarted that segment too
it has its moments
still disappointed they didnt go for new game! plus
there's a new season no?
https://tenor.com/view/mm-emu-emuemu-mio-isurugi-gif-9739040

very good
no

ones the anime kv anyway
both of them are in the news
you can easily see it when you compare the 2 congratz images
but i guess that makes sense, CH representative comes from YAL
love how YAL even is production manager instead of doing it themselves <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
i just dont remember songs on anime i watched
same but none of them had the animation muscle like onimai
oh prev message never send
the song is good but there's just too much disconnect with the visuals
i should rewatch it
inu-oh is amazing indeed
cr sure is slow on shows today damn
anos with the lines again <:adam:794719595901747231>
Maybe they'll get the author to write the base
Yeah
They'll prolly just go original?
Nah shouldnt
Yes give or take
Or so
3 chapters

god i love how the kendo girl is in like every scene ever in ippon again.
Their tweet sure reads like that
Ysh it might just be a few eps
At least it doesnt seem to be full seasons.

titanic in space was amazing
Yeah but those are dime a dozen
Im expecting jp announcement soon or after ep 3 airing
Whole thing
Probably the usual prod problems if that korean google tl is anything to go by.
https://www.aniplustv.com/customer/1?idx=70543

Lmfao (nier ep 4 delayed to feb 19 according to korean stream service for the show)
it was supposed to be their first project too <:LUL:545650745534447631>
The same as usual tbf
Just 10 times the productions in a year and internet existing
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Actual insanity
They just aired ep 6 too yesterday after a month delay
Loooo
(same thing uma musume did for s2 and its gacha)
Granted the gacha game is delayed so they might been waiting for that first or else they just canned it.
Reminds me that engage kiss was also supposed to be 24 split and then they never announced the other half <:teedus:774534056594767882>
Total eps? Fairly sure it was 24 split so 12-14 now and rest later
Prolly just waiting to announce it after ep 3 aired?
Nah nothing yet from official nier acc iirc
From 29 jan to 19 feb
3 weeks
Yeh
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
just believe in krr, minus february bcs thats apparently hell month.

<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
everything else is paywalled
Could be that
Altho 3k to go until gold certification. Think that was on 100k sold
Im still trying to figure out what that worlds music #4 thing means cs basically every popular idol show beats  bocchis 97k on albums
i would take more of ep 2 as long as its fun original content then just retreading the game again
well that wasnt a high bar
and if you want more delays (not that anyone would be watching it)
https://twitter.com/project_uniteup/status/1616815178938724353
aye they officially posted it now
https://nierautomata-anime.com/news/?id=62357
-indefinite delay (although the korean site said 19 february)
-blaming rona
she looks so lost if she's not looking at Michi
Mou Ippon: Hoping nagu joins the judo club too
<:CUHRAYZEEver:232760673740783627>
can't wait for the day parallel paradise gets an anime
lmfao thats funny
it just felt refreshing esp in fragrant flower to read a romance that didn't circle around the issue for hundreds of chapters just to extend the status quo
<:okay:330354891727962122>
there's also the reverse isekai slow farm manga orenchi ni kita onna kishi to inakagurashi surukotoninatta ken
the fragrant flower blooms with dignity
now im more hoping that they can actually do the past the confession justice
its at around ch 36 but its wholesome
<a:runninginthe90s:715521426865651763>
im reading one that has that beat
With how bad the combo is of covid and aniplex trash scheduling i feel like the risk would always be there.
Waiting for misfits to announce a delay so we have 4 aniplex sponsored shows delayes <:Teedus:632320401397252107>
they should have, its not like they work on 1 ep a time. I do agree with you they could keep it from completely collapsing but the moment they have to delay just one ep its kinda oof. As to much flak it would probably get I would just either delay the show to 2024 or actually go to jjk prod committee and ask if they can split cour that.
now they have 3 months
Edit: also a point that works in favor of a delay is that they're also relying on chinese inbetween companies and its those companies that are closed rn in China from covid.
like first half had a long lead in time before eps started to air and they still barely finished ep 11 and ep 12 just before broadcast
also it doesn't really take into account the lead in time?
they have too much money riding reviving the timeslot
they revived nichigo for g witch
they won't
which means any delay g-witch has pushes eps to 2024 (without any special changes)
JJK s2 takes its timeslot in summer and fall season so unless they talk to mappa and said production committee if they can delay that show or split cour it, even if they already announced its gonna air for 22-24 eps straight (i assume 22 eps cs you're still with the end of the year shenigans that also delayed 2 gwitch eps)
they don't have that luxury this time
yeah but they also had free timeslots to push it back too
g-witch is an easy guess <:LUL:545650745534447631>
CNY isn't even a factor in the delays. Its purely production that are already having problems in the first place not having any buffer to account for their outsourced inbetween studio's being closed down due to covid.
prolly magazine its published in
better then switching between 2d/cgi for the fight and causing more jarring issues
perfectly viable take to do with the camera work they went for with sally fighting
it was fine
Living in a world where im still watching onimai and dropped kubo <:Hachipain:962701126262739024>
<:LUL:545650745534447631>
He watches precure on sundays so ofc he has good taste
Precure reference <:kekl:753617830296944660>
https://puu.sh/JxF1h.png
More importantly
so pretty clear referencing to that
(there was a precure parody just before that)
yeah its the sunday morning slot so the toku/precure and one piece slot
Missing some cheeky stuff like mha or opm or something to make a reference to the guy who drew the baller endcard for the ep.
Its going a bit too much by the numbers for me just with voices added. Pretty sure i'll enjoy the manga though feels like thats gonna be paced a lot better.

I do like the shows op/ed. The artistry in the ed especially is super cute.
Im just gonna read it instead <:LUL:243896110001684480>
I can just go on youtube for that and put on the hanakana asmr vids and just read the thing
And no amount of hanakana asmr will make me watch it again
The delays are part of it but the show itself just isn't good. Granted ep 3 was a lot better in this regard and the first one I actually enjoyed but the first 2 felt like 10mins stretched over 24mins for no particular reason.  The show just like it would be hella lot stronger as a half runtime show.
misfits, they finally did the reveal <:blessindianguy:726717905588453468>
this is new games mangaka
nah
Afk arena isnt dead yet either after p5 collab
Its what the press release said so yes
he has such a baby face too for being 34
if they're not gonna be idols i'm a riot cs of mister bootleg aikatsu cd on it
the only annoying eps would be anniv crossover eps
its probably gonna be fine to start
yes
or hugtto guy would have been first ever male precure
they're not counting temps
so a year short
moonlight was 17
200% sure cs precure producer himself announced it
well 20th (19th) anniv season is the perfect time to do it

They do have robots tho!
I guess they are living beings instead of robots
i got 30 dollars for you <:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
these eps have been so good
Anna sure is raising as best mou ippon.
its the only thing kr fans have 😦
<:LULW:585868560534994972>
toys too <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
its literally kr/sentai but mahou shoujo
precure is like the one show where you could say it is anyway
which is a joke that got old 20 years ago
i think the problem is that everything is a kr/sentai reference regardless of precure
I will counter with karate idolman
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
granted the whole show looks like aikatsu characters thanks to the cd
the henshin is funny bcs it doesnt remind me of mahou shoujo but something they would actually do in the aikatsu coord scenes <:KEKW:632364419640328223>
and there's a dragon ball web anime coming
funny how they ignore super hero movie and broly movie though
heh
gotta blame the show that's been losing staff to every other toei property is a good take /s
<:Teedus:632320401397252107>

why would they look at precure for that and not you know

https://twitter.com/Char_Tweet/status/1507674378292580360?s=20
took a while to find, tweet itself is the one that mentions freedom upgrade
