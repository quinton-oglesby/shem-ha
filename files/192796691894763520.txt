Heck, give Kerrik the McNuggie Happy Meal while your at it
Usually offload these to reddit - looks like I've been shadowbanned or my post has been flagged and auto-hidden, here's my daily contribution
I remember thinking months back that I wanted to do fanart, i even bought myself a fancy wacom tablet, only for all my time to be consumed by xdu translations
Yea it was auto-filter for spam, it's cleared up now
Prob, i messaged the one who goes by vincent since he/she's the only one who seems active on the sub so ill wait and see
Teased the mod a little maybe idk lol, but I post every single day so maybe it was an auto filter
Looks like I've been potentially perma spam banned on the sub on reddit, so unless I get manually whitelisted again, its a pretty big rip
