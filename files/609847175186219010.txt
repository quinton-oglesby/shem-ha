Helloo! I just watched Chris shoot a sword to keep it in the air, now I'm here<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

Aaaye you’re back<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>

Real mvp in ORAS was the Archie/Maxie ost. They put as much sax and trombones in as they could and it’s beautiful
Can’t have enough tbh
Yeeeeeessss<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>
