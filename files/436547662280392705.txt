Already done
Maybe more
Well
Which would organize into systems of them
Extremely small
I mean litterally five blocks
With much more local governments
We should devide into a smaller system
Which is why we won't
And instead just have a direct democracy instead of a representative one
That's part of why I think we shouldn't have candidates in the first plafe
Yeah
You can also get a 1 party system
Not true
We should just have direct democracy where you can truly represent yourself instead of jumping into a box for someone to do it for you
Without having to explain all of them
Political spectrums are just a way to give a general view of a person or group of peoples beliefs
That's a very common belief
Actually that's not very odd
Also go ahead Stella
Just not for those reasons
And storming the capitol is a good idea
We do though
I mean
Well
Yup
Well yeah but it's pourpose is to do things for it's people
I never said it wasn't
Yeah
Also "ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country" is a very stupid quote because the entire point of a society, and by extension a country is to do things for it's people
That's not a supprise from a us president
Well
I'm pretty sure he litterally funded fascist organizations
Yes
I don't mean killing anyone
These are just goals and ideals I personally hold
None of my ideas can even impact anything in the present
Well
I'm not explaining anything well
God everything thinks I'm crazy now don't they
People would just be able to persue whatever they want
Nono
All production
I mean like
No
We could just let people do what they will
Once litterally everthing necessary is automated
But
It's probably not gonna come for well after every one of us is dead
And a shit load of it
For a perfect society we need time
Perfect doesn't exist yet

Hold on
Redcat
They explain some of the ideas I believe in much better than I can
I would recommend y'all read redcat though
Some aren't
Some are
Hmm
Well
But in the futuresome kind of utopia could theoretically be created
Not yet it doesn't
Well
Then we should just stop existing
If we can't achieve a perfect society I think it's best we don't exist at all
Lol
We could just try it
But likeee
Oki
Sorry
BUT THATS WHY WE MAKE IT SMALL SCALE Y'ALL LITTERALLY ARENT HEARING A WORD IM SAYING
I'm a form of realist nihilist too
Well
And why is that I might ask?
But less people will die over time if we do this
People would die from it tws
Thats my hope at least
Yes.
And we'll eventually find something that works
Let's just roll dice
Uniromically
We just need to try things
Let's turn politics into an actual science
Enough thinking and theorizing about how were gonna run things
We could just try it
Or
But the basic point is we should have extremely localized systems of goveremt
Though there are changes that are currently needed
I think what we have works alright for now
But those really aren't relevant in the modern day
Mine just have a bit more utopian transhumanist socialism
That actually fits pretty well around what I know of your beliefs too
Altruistic egoist yeah
I'd say Stella is uhhh
A lot of people confuse egoism with just "hey I'm edgy and think I want to kill people" or just flat out hedonism which it isnt
It's not a full proper explanation
Well
<@722121666641133608> there
Altruistic egoism is when you follow egoist ideas and want to help others as a result
Reject ideas constructed by society and the mind and simply follow what your own true beliefs and desires
Well the basics are
Time to return to my everyday life as an altruistic egoist
Reject morality embrace empathy
Moral philosphy I'll keep to
Imma stay out of politics
Cya
I'm not good at explaining my beliefs
God I'm just gonna stop talking now
Egoism =/= egotism
I'm a soulist
Well
I am a type of egoist
She should not have more kids
Don't fuck her
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
WTF
Hehe
Post left anarchists are pretty chill
Although
Ahahaaaaa
And egoists
And anarchists
And authoritarians
And rightist
Abrehamic religions too
As an ex-neocon I can confirm
Mhm

Tons of school field trips there
It's an old milliary fort in minnesota
Yes?
Hahaaas
I guess I must have jinxed it
Yeah
Aahhhg
Like the same sort of
Feels
Hehe
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
:)
And I'll be a librarian

^^
Definatly true
Hope that works out!
You two and me all
Quickly
It came crumbling down
But it didn't last at all
I felt happy for a day
Well I've tried to reject it
EEEEJHHHHHHH
To accept it and move past it
The point to to reject it without contracting away from it
I don't let it consume me
But this is the coping method that works best for me
But
...
I actually have found huge success with letting the sadness in and not retracting from it
Ill just be the content sage character then
I forgot the name but there is one
This is actually super effective
This is a recommended method
But
Ope
It can be much better to just relax into the pain and feel it rather than try and block it out with happiness
Actually
Ahaaa
Probably a better idea than the music I usually listen to when sad
Alright
Hehe
Pff
Hehe
Thanks
Yes
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Thank you..
Thank you
Ive been clean for a little over a month now
Self harm urges
<:MikuKiss:738240587014340649>
Thanks
*hug*
I know I can get through it
*hug*
But its just mild urges
Ig
I meam
Hmm
I wish Spotify discord connections actually worked on mobile
Hehe
Vibe
Just
I prefer not to work myself to death
I just
Cardio
Also fine screaming crazy world it is
Hm?
Pfft
That I'm listening to
Name of the song
Sweet suicide
What should I listen to
Hmm
I just have a much wider range
Ahaa
I mean I wouldn't call baby hotline a sad song
<:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
I love you too
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Hehe
Whatever
Well
Although it's not quite sad?
Oki
Hehe
But its helpful for me
It does that for you
I promise
Trust me Stella this is what works for me
Just a different way
Yeah so you're doing the same
Very soon
You'll crash
And even if you bring yourself up
If you don't do that you'll just be down constantly
Not dissociating or ignoring the pain and letting it be there and understanding it and just letting it go away is good for you
Yeah but recognizing what you're feeling and not repressing it is good for you
Bruh
Yeah
Id be very confused if the house was covered in something that triggers her allergies
Uhhhh
But will keep that in mind
Stuff too heavy for general
It makes sense to be a channel for that sort of thing so you can see the confusion
I mean
Oh boy I sure do love it when calling me a slur is often considered socially acceptable
But shut the fuck up terf is too far
People telling me to kill myself being fully serious are completely fine
Meanwhile
Bunch of bullshit
Yeah
Hehee
Oki
Turns out I'm just dumb
I was confused earlier because I couldn't find the shit post channel
I missed it
Woah
Do you take universalist horizontalist memes that nobody understands?
Oki
It's actually closer to the ansynd flag because of the cat
Well
Yeah
Fineeeeee
Ye
Youre a girl and you're trans but they're two separate labels
It's more
Gender non-conforming
It's gnc
Wait wrong acronym
NGC is the common term that encompasses drag, trans people, and femboys/tomboys
Well generally
Mhm
They aren't trying to trick anyone
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Cute guys just wanna be cute guys
The term ||trap|| implies that someone's just trying to trick people
Ye
True
And ferris
The one character from steins gate
Also
Yeah
Basically just any trans or femboy anime character meme
It's very common
Also being autistic I agree
Ecofascism
That would never happen
Clearly no authoritarian dictator could have just taken advantage of the people and used socialist retoric and naming so that they could be more popular
It's in the name
Obviously the NSDAP and USSR were socialist
Yeah clearly
Socialism in it's simplest meaning is a democracly run economy
There's a genuine reason
But like
Please this is something so many people get wrong
Ok first off define communism
Bruh
Basically the republic is fucked and the only way to fix the US is through direct action
Yup
They don't do shit
Ok but this is the dems we're talking about
Although people seem to have no idea what it means
It is making a comeback I'm pretty sure
And that makes sense
Cya!
I'll talk some more at a later date
Anywho I'm tired of talking about politics rn
But the situation I gave could also mean a direct democracy
True
As in
I mean
I guess its riding right along the boarder
Hmm
And if the corporations are just run as a democracy instead then I would also consider that a form of socialism
Ye
To me I'd say
Not necessarily
The proper definition of communism imo is a stateless, moneyless, and classless society
Socialism is generally just the Democratic organization if an economy rather than an autocratic one (this can be achieved through many ways and can or cannot imply the government/state being more directly involved in the economy depending on the specific ideology)
But backtracking
Even though the most they ever even claimed was being socialist
Clearly examples of communism
It's not like even FUCKING LENIN was against Stalin coming into power
It's not like the very first people Hitler went after were the socialists
Awwh
It would mean the exact same universe but you're alive instead of dead
Ex we both went into the box
Unless your survival nicecitated mine
Well
And never be able to go to yours
So id still be in the universe where you died
And also if you proved it you'd be leaving everyone behind
Yeah
?
Microwavable pizzas
Pika she doesn't have a choice
Mhm
But nowhere near enough
Maybe a bit more
I did the math and yesterday Stella's mom only gave her about 1000 calories
Yeah
Heh
Everyone looks good in a pretty dress
Dam
Are they relevant?
Any r&j laws?
Uhh
Luckily I'll be staying in a cabin away from anyone so that shouldn't be much of an issue
It's not too bad here but the legal protections and general amounts of transphobia are worse here
I'm in a different state now
Nah
I'm not legally protected from hate crimes anymore apparently
Well
Time to turn on the racism
It's some feeling deeply laced into my sense of identity
Which Tumblr problem
Dang
Ok fair
Its often used for mental health stuff for example
NSFW doesn't purely equal porn
But at the same time
discord ~~NSFW~~ servers are a breeding ground of revenge porn and CP
¿Que?
Huh
OHH
Then you can't even access channels like this
Well
I can do that just fine?
But
Huh
Sorry I seem to be out of the loop
What happened?
Simply give yourself the roll and delete everything
If you have a roll below them that can delete Chanel's then they can delete the server
And allow you to turn it into its own perm
Bots just make the whole thing simpler
And if you fuck up your levels you end up with a deleted server
It's a lot more
Yeah but thats not just mute
Mute
But it's not a perm you can give someone
Yeah
Well
That's ßoßīotÿ
Well
Hehe
And mute is a bot thing
Many servers don't include ban
Well
And access to warnings with bots
Many servers have levels of moderation that's just delete messages
Exactly
At least not consistently
On bots usually there's an option to just say "these roles are mod rolls" because there's no real way to tell just from perms
Probably not manage server
Maybe they'll make a mod thint
Idk
The one that gives all perms
Probably administrator
I don't care now
Cool
Huaaaa
aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Or the fact it runs on spaghetti code
Or when it was litterally porn
Like when they changed it from blue to blue
There are many Tumblr problems
Fair
Ope
So anyone could just join on any other device and use it on their phone no problem
But then all NSFW server would just have that as their main one
Discord might just add a feature that lets you say a role is a mod role
Yeah we got off topic

Ok but counterpoint
I find them more convenient
Ok but it's convinent
Whatayagonnado
But
True
Hm?
Well you can just give them access to the mute command
Mhm
Doesn't matter
We've tried to compromise over and over and over again and they wouldn't take it, the time for asking nicely came and passed
Is it really 2 parties though?
WHAT THE FUCK
I just learned about the Florida shit
My parents straight up gave me a mental illness and then got pissed at me because that mental illness inpeaded my ability to function
OSDD-3
I never thought this could actually happen
My brain is still reeling from learning the news
Hello yes
Of course!
Early morning 3rd in Japan but late at night 2nd somewhere else
Maybe it's a timezones thing?
Mhm
Hmm
On April 3rd
It starts airing tommorow
Although it hasn't gone up yet
It's on animepahe and animesimple
Well
Hmm
They're very different animes
Ehhh
Oretwi
Have fun
Cool bears
Have fun!
It seems great but it's just not something I could get into
I started it but then stopped
Not the other kind of gay bears
Lesbian bears
But at the same time?
He slips into a depression when he becomes solar for a while so
Except not a pedophile
Twoearle reminds me of Stella when I first met her
Now that I think about it
A girl from twintails I forgot the name of
I'm not referring to actual shirabe
Glasses shirabe is pretty gay
Oh right!

Stella huggies
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Hrjfh
Whenever anything remotely negative happens I have a mental breakdown
Dang
Who even used KissAnime?
It litterally doesn't exist in legal places
And in some cases
Plus the actual creators get basically nothing from it so theres not much point anyways
Bibi
Existence is pain and chocolate is delicious
Anyways
Yeah
It's not like you'd actually be supporting the creators anyways
I mean who doesn't pirate everything
Dam
It tells you everywhere you can watch an anime and automatically updates your Mal as you watch
Mal sync
Mal has a great chrome extension though
I just use whatever it's on
Mhm
I gotta watch that thrn
Oh dang
||specifically 15 years earlier||
Never seen the kill your family show before?
