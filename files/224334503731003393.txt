Thanks for the tip!
Just started a Hard Autoscorer raid, but I'm guessing there's an easier way to farm the biggest melody crystals.  Any suggestions?
I'll open a big Carol too, just to have a matching set.
Guess I forgot I opened this.
Help much appreciated!
I put up a Power raid when I was still half-asleep. Probably has 3 or so hours left.
