G shinais were done by Anonymous

G E1 or E2 I think
said back in G
„ÅÜ„Çç„Åü„Åà„Çã„Å™ is a Maria line
well, it's the closest thing to whatever she is wearing

not really the first time Nana acted lewd for a pv
```details about METANOIA PV that Nana mentioned in Nana's radio show:
> was shot in the ruins of a shopping center in the middle of a city in ibaraki prefecture
> PV setting is the modern era instead of the future/past; main message is "live your own life" 
> there are pyrotechnics involved, with some smoke displays emitting rainbow colors
> they hired some people to do parkour
> has some shots of Nana with blue hands like an avatar and pink and orange eyeshadow
> they hired a foreign 180cm DJ (english-japanese half) to show up in it
> has some scenes with a buggy car
> has lewd shots of Nana, director of the PV made Nana show her legs, touch her thighs, etc
apparently it was so embarrassing for Nana that the cameraman told people to scram so that no one would see her while she was being filmed
it was doubly embarrassing and awkward because all of her staff have been taking care of her since she was 22 so they were all like old relatives for Nana```

i've come here to say young Tsubasa a cute
hopefully
i believe kaneko would fix this
TSUBASA DIDN'T DESERVE THIS
Tsubasa didn't deserve this
since Tsubasa is the leader of the group, and the person they look up to the most
it was a great plan by the villains
tsubasa didn't deserve this
i
agree about Tsubasa's outfit being the best
kazanari family was also affiliated to ahnenerbe according to keywords
then he resigned because of a mistake and put genjuuro onhis position
the keywords and his bio said he used to be the head of 2nd div
friendly reminder to read the keywords
ive dropped by to say Tsubasasan is very cool
no
nana's best role is clearly Tsubasa though
btw Tsubasa's voice actress is also Hinata for those who didn't know
yes
and so is elfnein singing
ayahi mimicking elfnein is a symphogear radio joke
she did it in this scene

this episode was hard to understand even if you do know japanese
Tsubasa's CD is delayed till september
also Tsubasa doesn't really fit in the naming scheme because her name doesnt have a kanji for a number
i see
```According to a GX keyword, Basa has her name instead of a number reference because Yatsuhiro wanted her to be free from Kazanari family BS```
which keyword was that
why isn't Tsubasa named with a number
but the most interesting thing here is
the other ones would also have numbers in their names i assume
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
its gonna be on the bds
why does this exist
Tsubasa just wants to sing freely, not be involved in overly convoluted matters like adhering to her family's will
XVbasa wants guidance and help because she knows in her heart that this isn't the thing she wants to do
s1 Tsubasa sought for a meaning in life after the most important person in her life was gone
saying kanade's name doesnt mean she just went full circle although it does seem that way
there's a huge difference between the Tsubasa seeking Kanade in s1 and this XV Tsubasa
Tsubasa calling out for Kanade's help isn't regression, they're just showing how bad Tsubasa was hit by this series of tragic events
i've only read the manga, but it's quite faithful to source so far
despite being 3DCG, the animation looks good, same goes for not fight scenes, as expected of Xebec.
though, the mechas are in 3DCG
It's pretty great so far
