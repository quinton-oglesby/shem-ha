Already too deep in the Symphogear hellhole
Didn't think I'd see familiar faces already
Oh hey Lexi  <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Wait actually I already did, 2 friends are watching lmao
Guess it's my duty to continue the legacy
<:HibikiShock:726645026725167114>
Umm I guess I was supposed to introduce myself, I'm Hase and I'm extremely new to symphogear as a whole but I've been enjoying it a lot! So looking forward to meeting others that do too!
And I gotta blame Jorge for my Hibiki obsession
Hihi <:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
YOOOO
