yeah sorry just wanted to tell you guys I kind of need a break and won't be very active here for a  little while, for those confused
<:blobhug:665338452006535206>
I was trying to unhide muted channels and my phone lagged out
I accidentally left lol
nice
yeah actually this sucks
not finished yet, tell me what you guys think



so heres an scp i wrote
<@297542051057238017> yeah, but the characters aren't fighting one enemy together, they fight amongst each other
The Not-Stands, instead of being more human-looking but with cyborg Stand-looking body parts, instead they were just humans, but they could wear a Tokusatsu-inspired suit to use their abilities
So I figured out how to add onto my idea
I've had some Not-Stands planned for BQBQBQ (I'm gonna call it BQ3) and Pink Moon
And songs and albums too
Anyways I'm wondering if that's an idea worth writing.
(they wouldn't be called Stands)
With out-of-the-box superpowers and music references like JoJo, and a similar sort of "free for all" to the Holy Grail war, as well as Stands being more human and having actual personalities like Servants.
Its a story heavily inspired by the concepts of both Fate and JoJo's Bizzare Adventure
So there's this idea that i had
Huh
There's a new when they cry?
I suppose so
But that would just be the same thing
Maybe humans that transformed into Stands?
I guess I'll scrap that idea then.

first art of the year
idk whats wrong with me
why does it look like her torso has been twisted backwards

the gates of heaven have opened

yep
"I dont feel so good, Hibiki"
~~Symphogear moe blob comics>>>>>>>>>> Symphogear~~
Symphogear XV ending spoilers
Why is this in the art channel
Kirika looks confused for some reason
Impact font makes me think: "oh ironic meme"
Like the art right before it would be great if they just changed the font
Eww impact font
Kirika in Symphogear anime: Aware of her own naivety but is accepting of it and has a deep bond with Shirabe
Kirika in Symphogear 4koma: fish idiot
Yeah that's why they are moe blob comics
(kidding)

Dess to all my enemies
She eats souls I guess

A strange pairing

Do you listen to any music while drawing btw or is that too distracting? <@247701824335904770>
Second was energetic short brown hair
I remember the girl with airsoft guns was my fav

<a:HibikiWarCry:613117025501446144>
I'm in several music servers and servers for other interests where this is also a thing
And not just anime servers either
Combined
I mean anime isn't the only easy to learn artstyle though
There's more to art then anime
Like it's cute and all, but every time I go into an art channel thats all i see
I'm starting to think that anime art is an oversaturated medium
I love short hair Astolfo ‚ù§ ‚ù§ ‚ù§

that one might be nsfw tbh


but there's no sword so....
that's certainly an interesting ship
hard choice

is the second one nsfw?


This is what I was trying to post

Im not even gonna delete that
Wait THAT WAS THE WRONG IMAGE LMAOOOOOOOOO

i found this somewhere

cool
only manga
but no more anime binges
i might still keep up with seasonals
im gonna watch symphogear xv tho
yeah me 2
i used to use before i stopped watching anime
animefreak.tv
happy birthday song! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I'm waiting till the first episode to hear the OP and ED
oh shit
shit whens the first episode
^
***EXTERMINATE***
I mean Glorious Break is still the one I prefer
1. ?
2. Man
Did the first episode air?
???
I mention anything Symphogear related and Christian hangs up
Lmao
Meteror Light and Next Destination are good too
Big agree
Yeah
Vitilization tho
It came with the IGNITE remix of Hibiki's theme
I had it on my iPod a while ago
Why not?
What a contrast
It's so peaceful
And Green Green too
GENOCIDE
And the IGNITE mix of Hibiki's theme
Not to mention both Carol songs
Bayonet Charge, Exterminate, and Glorious Break
Kirika is too cute omg
Just because the whole thing was a massive letdown
I'm considering not watching the rest
```Fuck. 
I felt very underwhelmed by this, not because it's any worse than the other 4, but because it's that good, and I wasn't enjoying it. I felt sort of bored most of the time. I don't think I'm gonna like the new villains, they seem pretty standard. The action scenes were cool, but I wasn't enjoying them all that much. Hibiki's singing during that one part annoyed me a lot for some reason.  I think maybe I just don't like Symphogear anymore, because this didn't feel like I was watching the worst Symphogear episode, it felt like I was watching Symphogear and realizing it actually sucked.```
So yeah I'm gonna write up my thoughts
This one began with losing and then winning
The past 3 seasons have begun with the gang winning a fight and then losing a fight in the first episode
Ok so something interesting I noticed
So far this has been very disappointing
Well I'm almost finished
First being the excellent Devilman Crybaby
This is the second time I've seen Trump in an anime
WAS THAT DONALD TRUMP
Let my idiocy get the better of me there
Oh sorry
It irks me for no real reason
Because I just don't like it when in fiction people blame super serious real world issues on something in the show
But I felt super annoyed when they were talking about climate change
Also y'all gonna laugh at me
I'm just confused why I liked the other 4 so much but not this
Nah it's a personal thing
Never seen SAO and never intend to
Was Vexiollogy getting a 10/100 and Trapped In The Closet getting a 5/100
The only things that I've rated as worse
Yeah that's pretty bad
Imma give it like a 20/100
Well that's about it
I hate it
<@256802531584376833> i have a similar experience with DragonBall
Pretty much
There are some JoJo references but not as much as the fanbase thinks
Symphogear is no longer my 3rd favorite anime I don't think
Yes
JoJo good
More
You can see it if you like
Well, I wrote a thing about it
<@99695384296701952> I think you can tell by my nickname what I thought of the new episode
I just realized it wasn't my thing anymore
Nothing bad happened
I don't watch anime anymore so
Cause itll feel weird
I kinda don't want my friends to watch Symphogear anymore
I will never finish FMAB ever even if I tried
Jokes on him I don't want him to watch it anymore
My friend is like "oh I'm not gonna watch Symphogear until you watch FMAB"
I'm gonna keep watching and I hope I'll change my mind
IDK I'm tired
Hibiki's Stand could be Give Peace A Chance
Close Encounters Of The Third Kind HD Remaster
he probably watched the last transformation while on speed and thought it was porn or something so he made this
apparently tone it down means pole dancing
please no
wtf is this new kirika transformation
I physically don't have time
Well I didn't finish the episode but Symphogear is still boring
Imagine if this leads to in the future people just accepting pedophilic behavior
Man
Doesn't fuggin matter
Is like 16
Kirika
Ok but keep in mind
You took enjoyment out of that??
Excuse me?
Also man fuck whoever made Kirika's transformation sequence
So I have an obligation to watch it
I'm not dropping it purely because it used to be my favorite anime
I will
I like the characters but action scenes bore me half to death
Bye
Alright as a minor I don't feel like talking to pedos
Thanks
Its not really that bad when I actually think about it
<@189146272865845248> I just want to apologize, I was totally in the wrong in that situation.
Yeah
I'm not trying to spit at it
good to know
I'm not allowed to have a different opinion around you
ah
because Ive gotta give it a fair shot
Its probably the least ive ever been immersed in anything
I feel like "oh shits happening onscreen, great when is this over"
i dunno i just feel this odd disconnect from the anime that i dont feel with anything else
no, I'm going to continue to give my criticism
it was a lot better than the last one but still kina boring
alright i finished the episode
i like this new villain a lot
i do like that these new villains arent pussies and are just willing to fucking go all out no matter the consequences
i do like that that girl getting killed was in the exact same shot as the girl getting killed in the first season, its a pretty naisu throwback
if anything this song is pretty cool but thats so far the only cool thing in this show
im at the concert scene now
im starting it up again
that seems good
no I'm forcing myself to
I'm sure it'll click with me at some point
which is why I'm still watching it
and I really want to
I'm trying to enjoy this show
Bruh we on the front page of r/anime
Miku won't confess her love to Hibiki in XV
Let's think realistically
The autoscorers were pretty crazy but I'm impressed that I totally saw this coming but the execution was so good it felt completely out of the blue
My heart skipped a beat and I felt chills down my spine
This is unironically the hypest reveal in anime ever

i cant wait for this new episode man
(but this is the wrong channel)
So I'd rather not
But there's that one guy who makes fun of me for whatever i say
Cause I want to talk in there
I feel bad about Valk
i dont want ver back
topdad is awful
<#336297840529899522>
i cant keep up
whats even happening

FUCK WHY IS TOPDAD THERE
Tsubasa is straight up having a not good time
I just did now
Wait i overreacted
DID GENJURO JUST DIE
WHAT THW FUCK
***smiles nonchalantly***
TOPDAD:
Hibiki: *just lost her girlfriend*
Kinda wanted Tsubasa to have an actual fight with Millarc but ok
I think the pacing was just a little off in this episode
Yeah
Millarc and Elza are definitely major villains
Uh?
Seems like a bit of an abrupt way to kill off two major villains
Was very confusing scene
Did they just fucking die or
So what happened to Noble Red anyways?
Yeah can't think of anything
Oh I thought you meant bad like poorly written
||What about the best god in all of anime, Hanyuu|| Higurashi spoilers
Heavencloud Heavencloud Heavencloud
hibimiku kiss
please writers
Yeah I'm all for pissing waifuers off
NOOOOOOOOOOOO
So I believe it doesn't work in general chat afaik
It got spammed a lot
||lowkey he was kinda hot tho||
not as much as fine
eh i thought adam was kinda eh to
Slenderman lmao
and after XV11 i can say XV is the best season so far
catching up on the next few eps
So XV13 is the end to Symphogear ig
every reveal just gets hyper

WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
ITS BACK
FROM G1
TAHT SONG
WAIT
the fight scene at the beginning alone has such great choreography
GIGIGIGGIGIGGIGIGI
that too tho
no i mean mini millarc
can we agree that miniarc is bad
Satelite has one chance for a HibiMiku kiss
It is 3 days until the end of Symphogear
jokes aside that was a great ending
nah i know its confirmed im being semi ironic
recency bias aside
but unironically that was probably my favorite Symphogear
i didnt expect them to even show anything gay but THEY GOT MY HOPES UP AND AAAAAAAAAAAAAA
XV is the worst Symphgoear
thats it
and then the FUCKING EPISODE ENDED
hibiki and miku were boutta confess
IM ACTUALLY GOING TO EXPLODE
THEY JUST FUKCINT TEASED US
OHMY FUCKING GOD
OOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
SYNCHROGRAZER
SYNCHROGRAZER
SYNCHROGRAZER
they did everything but show them confess
they did not leave it to the imagination
OH MY GOD
THE SHINAIS
FUCKING HAPPENED
AND IT
everyone was like "Oh i wish Mikugear came back and Hibiki and Miku confessed but that aint gonna happen"
before XV
i love how
||/s||
<@309482589121413121>  fuck you go to hell piece of shit
right there
my heart melted
Now Symphogear is over
Fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck
that Synchrograzer at the end brought me back to watching S1 for the first time when I was 12
yeah Symphogears a bit niche
I had an epiphany, I enjoy Symphogear and action shows and tokusatsu and kaiju movie and all that
Uh
Oh yeah
BUT THE CRYYYYYYIIIIINNG
ITS AAAALLLLLL OVER
And they are all depressed and wear black
K-On but they are an emo metal band
I saw that comment
~~ew Fortnite cringe Minecraft is the best game ever stfu~~
What game do you think Kirika would stream mostly?
Idk why it strikes me as that
Honestly Kirika as a streamer and Shirabe as an editor is sort of wholesome
Sombra main myself but that's going a little too off topic
She'd probably stream League like once but stop playing it after that because of the community
Do any characters in Overwatch have a dab emote?
She'd mod the game to get her emerald hoe
Maybe Genji
Who would she main?
I wonder if she'd play Overwatch
Idk why it feels like a while since I've talked to you
Huh
Havent seen u in a while
Ninyru
Futurism is certainly fantastic
<@152896851660505088> where do you get that emote
I read an article on tjis once
I'll remember that thanks
9/10 show
overall
yall better listen to kero kero bonito
this is it
G ending was great
Grim Reaper "no, you were one of the best"
XV "was i a good anime?"
Goodbye XV
The fall of an empire
üî•
Idk where i was going with this joke
And she became more confident
Outside gave her some hugs between AXZ and XV

Poor Maria
This is all you see before the chat is gone

Ah of course
dess_timely
XDU sucks [2]
ok
Oh
whats GRS
<@!127644949884698624> Society is shifting and eventually homosexual and transgender people will be more accepted. Just act however you want to act
ok
are you a man or woman
wait
ill leave it at that
ok
not trying to get banned here
whats goin on
alright
sorry about that
i remember that
sounds really homophobic
im actually kind of glad i wasnt involved
same
sounds great
what anime are they watching
im sorry
but everyone makes mistakes
he was wrong in saying that shit
yes, we should destroy his career as the most talented singular edm artist because of some stupid shit he said
ive basically decided that although i dont agree with 90% of the stuff he says, i still like his music
it seems sort of lazy
<@!99695384296701952> idk if i should support this

i feel like i should confront him, but idk how
they've expressed serious discomfort about this
anyways, hes been asking some of the girls in my grade out over and over again, including my ex (who i am surprisingly still friends with)
hes 18 yrs old, and one of my old friends from middle school
so theres this guy in my school
if you need any help let me know
im sorry man
do you think deadmau5 can come back from the controversy
jesus
yeah
idk whats wrong with me
almost everything is going right for me
the worst part is i dont know why
ive been really sad lately
its a long way off tho
my parents dont respect my privacy at all
i cant wait to get out of my house
im going to confess to this girl i like
im both anticipating and dreading tuesday
oh shit wut
is this a good idea or
i've been thinking I should wait a good while, and then ask S if she has anything planned and if she wants to go out for a bite
i might ask again indirectly in a few months
she said that her relationship life was kind of a mess and that she wasn't ready to get into a relationship
the girl (who i will refer to as S)
so
imma stop thinking about it
sorry
<@!99695384296701952> (my definition of "a good long while" is longer then 6 months dont worry)
sorry guys
i just realized i accidently posted that in serious disccusion
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8WEV_u78QV0
that sounds cool
its weird yeah
oh my lord
holy shit thats awful
actually i was bullied because i liked anime
but not because i acted weird
i was bullied a bit when i was twelve
yeah but maybe separate the kids who really need help from the kids who are just a bit off like me
^
ill see
idk
its mixed
other types
which is what i hate the most
the people there are shut out from the rest of the school
basically this one wing in the building is reserved for this program for kids "like me"
fuck whatever chromosome gave me aspergers
im too old for this shit
and only one gives me homework
I only feel challenged in exactly two subjects
all the classes are ridiculously easy
the whole thing has basicallly taught me to be introverted
im in this special class because I have aspergers
i fucking hate my school
idk why that would be funny
um
i thought she was the one who wanted to break up and didnt want to tell me
i didnt want to break up with her
and as you can see my mind is fucking scrambled
and now hes really mad at me
I was talking about this with my best friend, and he said "all I'm going to say is, if you get back together with her, I'm not talking to you ever again"
and now the problem comes up
so i started thinking that maybe she had misunderstood me
and Cate said she didn't know why
so then she asked why we broke up
and anyways me and Cate stayed silent the whole time
and she suddenly started saying "oh you two should go out again" and talking about why
so today we were joking around with one of her friends
anyways thankfully we've somehow stayed close friends
so I assumed she was the one who wanted to break up
and then i decided "maybe she wants to break up" and asked her "do you want to break up" and then she said "if it's ok with you"
and so one day I asked her "what's wrong" and she didn't answer
when I broke up with (i'll just refer to her as Cate), it was because for a few days she seemed kind of depressed
so ill give a bit of context first
moving two states away
i cant imagine moving
I might be moving from the house I've lived in for 11 years
i just learned
is this the day god decided "Oh, everything's going great for Cam. TIME TO THROW 3 DIFFERENT SHITSTORMS AT HIM AT ONCE!!!!"
fuck
jesus
im going to sort the issue with my friend out first
i am really
and wait until Cate responds to my text
im going to wait until my friend gets online and then call him again
i think now everyone here has finally realized the big dumbass i am
no i talk to him pretty much every day
nah
<@125353790537728001> theyve never actually met
this has become a total fustercluck
ive tried calling both of them and neither have picked up
he was acting very off from usual
fuck
until now i thought she was the one who broke up with me
btw i didnt break up with her because she was depressed, if thats what people are thinking
no
my friend contacted me and said that his phone ran out of battery and didnt charge overnight and thats why he didnt recieve my texts and calls
my dad didnt get the job
we're probably still gonna move eventually tho
ok so im not moving two states away
sorry
im going to avoid talking about my political opinions
<@!154722817412300800> you're right
never mind i dont want to talk about my political opinions
dont take this as hate speech
not because i hate them
i think maybe people with mental conditions shouldn't vote
can people with mental disorders vote?
YEAH
I second that
I hope it goes OK
id agree with you though, I'd say the unknown risk is better
i dont know what to say
https://www.oneangrygamer.net/2019/02/u-n-proposes-initiative-to-ban-loli-shota-and-underage-drawings-and-cartoons/77229/#disqus_thread
big sad
she said she forgot why she broke up with me, but based on the way she said it, I don't think the whole thing was a misunderstanding
also update on the cate situation
I had this one teacher in 5th grade that I really hated but I never acted on it, but towards the end of the year it finally burst out
It sounds tough
I hope everything goes fine
im so relieved
they havent told me the actual rules yet (thats for at dinner), but they told me what they would be like
not so far
they are still gonna install the camera, but thats not as terrible
anyways the good news is that there'll be time during the day to talk to you guys and play video games
sorry was doing something
Im so happy
unless they postpone it again of course
theyre gonna tell me later today
Yeah
I had none really
I tried to attack them
Under those rules, I also could only use Discord for 30 minutes a day
oh yeah its because i kept disobeying their previous rules and they really had no way of knowing. To be fair i could only play video games for an hour a day 3 days a week
context?
but i hope they dont go too far like reddit did
tbh i dont care about loli and shota porn being gone
not as terrible as i thought
The main part is that depending on the day I have 30-90 minutes of on screen time
Ive been told all the rules now
so
I'd put Far Cry 4 but it might be scary for them
the baby must be raised with Subnautica, Guild Wars 2, and Megadimension Neptunia VII
Oh that's great?
i dont know to be honest
would it be a bad idea to ask Silla if she wants to go out to eat and maybe see a movie sometime soon?
so its been just about 3 months
i really just hope it goes well, I don't want her to get hurt
im just really paranoid about her hating me
i dont know
and I'm really worried that if it doesn't work out she'll hate me
and my advice was to confront him and ask him to stop
basically her friend was doing something that she didnt feel comfortable with
so I had to give Silla some advice
(my internet is being slow rn)
i try to
basically glofrified babysitter for my sister
I don't need to explain all the things wrong with that logic
also she says I have to marry a woman and have children when I grow up
Yes, I have to love my mom, who is a social justice hypocrite and supports anti-vaxxers, just because she's my mom. makes a lot of sense
she thinks I have to love my family unconditionally purely because they are my family
she is so old fashioned
i cannot have a conversation with my au pair
<@!102691114762371072> she's 10 years older than me. I'm *definitely* not romantically interested in her.
yeah that would fit
which one?
e.g. one time she told me she couldnt understand why I enjoyed playing video games so much, and I told her "Oh yeah, I thought you were an introvert". And then she says "I don't always spend my time inside!" "Oh yeah? what do you do for fun?" "I go to parties!". I am 100% sure she has no idea what the word introvert means
its just, I constantly have to be around her, and she will always force her incredebly narrowminded views on me
pretty much
She is a Christian fanatic, a Trump supporter, and an extreme extrovert who calls herself an introvert even thought she has no idea what being an introvert is like to the point where it gets insulting sometimes. She also has no sense of privacy and will barge into my room at literally any time. Add onto that, she constantly forces her opinions onto everyone around her
ok, so I have to explain my au pair's personality
Ok this issue with my au pair is becoming really annoying now
they were very supportive!
2. I am going to tell my parents the same thing, and I'm also going to finally, after at least a year and a half of being in the closet, come out as bisexual
1. I told my instructor for Catholic Confirmation that I was an atheist and would no longer go through the course, and she respected my desicion
I did something important today and I'm going to do another very important thing soon
If you are gonna stoop so low as to call a trans person a tr_p, you are undeniably an asshat
one of the reasons I left the boy scouts was actually because my scoutmaster was a complete homophobe
My au pair is straight
No my friend
My parents were totally fine when I came out as bi. Cate, on the other hand, her dad wasnt ok with her being bi.
she seems like an asshat
Of course
Yeah, when the election was happening it was the same thing with me, my parents, and Clinton
I think he just blindly follows Trump because his parents do
he was one of the first people who I told about being bi
Oh he's fine with LGBT stuff
yeah, he understood where I was coming from and we agreed to disagree
And then I listed a few major reasons why Trump is one of the worst US presidents in history
So he said that Trump had done more than any other president in history, but could only name like one minor thing
Basically, when I hear "crossdresser", I get the same vibe I do when I hear "homo" used in a derogatory way
I have to go to bed, but I'll just say that I dont know why the word makes me uncomfortable and wish there was another term I could use
I mean I just prefer shifter
Not really
I'd just feel more comfortable looking like a girl sometimes
Because I want to look female
No, what I mean is if someone asks or incorrectly genders me I'll say I'm male but otherwise I won't say
<@!175163984197058560> both questions yes
Jacket, T shirt, sweatpants, either silver hat or Gorillaz hat
My usual wear
Depends on my mood
Some days I'll dress masculine and some days I'll dress feminine
Other people
Actually sorry people were yelling at me and I couldnt think right, I do wanna pass as a women, I read it as trick people into thinking because my brain was on autopilot mode
my intention is definitely *not* to trick people
Just cross dress and not look terrible
Shit reason I know
Just an interest of mine for a little while, I kept telling myself I'd look terrible but then recently I had a dream that it worked and ever since then Ive been inspired to make it work
My bad
Sorry thats what a lot of peoples arguments were so I thought you were going to lead into that
(Rena bes girl tho)
Of course
I liked Higurashi because of the mystery and characters and creepy atmosphere
I didn't like goblin slayer
Which was some people a few months ago
I thought at first that you were coming from the perspective of people who can't accept women being vilified in TV shows
I guess I can see where you're coming from now, so I'll just agree to disagree
I mean in the later episodes it shows that she's idolized the sheild hero since childhood
But he never really treats her like a slave
Ok
Look I've tried to show Higurashi to multiple friends and almost all of them refuse to watch it because it has 11-yr olds getting murdered and disemboweled
Ok then don't watch the show
Ok what is the problem then
There was some controversy because he adopts a loli as a slave to fight for him because he can't fight for himself, but it's not like it promotes child slavery
Rather than most isekai where the main character is beloved by everyone instead everyone hates him
With a very dark world
Its an isekai
Look if anything it just shows how fucked up the world of the show is, rather than saying "child slavery is ok"
I'm not even going to bother arguing with you about this
<@209036464900538371> I agree about Raphtalia
I love shield hero so far
this has gone beyond serious discussion
<#371105434771390465>
whats precure
a big eh
this is elfen lied for me
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c51dfhfEVFc
Elfen Lied is kina eeeeehhhhhh
its my 4th fav anime
I love Devilman Crybaby
of course
*11-13
this particular one was 12
and my friends stood up for me
only one kid had a problem, and it was an idiot middle schooler
it went great
yeah i talked about it in <#336297387863703552>
oh
wait what happened
thank nana
thats garbage
we're just regressing
oh no
mark my words, its going to be something along the lines of "homosexuality is too mature a topic for children"
i cant wait to hear the reason Alabama tells everyone for taking the episode off air
FUCK people who use religion as a way to defend homophobia
https://twitter.com/LectricLord/status/1135036295884038146
they are silencing people who speak out against transphobes
this is essentially transphobia tho
I hope twitter comes under fire for this
really
what happened
But that small percentage that are idiots get memed and then impressionable kids like myself think that all of them are idiots
Most feminists arent bad
Thats what I'm saying
I fell into that trap
but i also hate the people on the right who show kids this and say "all feminists are like this"
i not only hate her
*sighs*
Anthony Fantano has done multiple videos on him
<@209036464900538371> Tom Macdonald is a white rapper who makes songs about "the hatred for caucasians"
he is presenting the Tom Macdonald argument basically
he's now ranting that "I'm being banned because I am a straight white cis male"
i still kind of am
yeah
he was making fun of my nonbinary friend and me and my boyfriend and called our school a "r*tard school"
this kid is a little shit
yeah im an atheist
this 7th grader visiting our school
jesus
I need to relax
I can't handle this at all
ive been crying constantly this whole afternoon
and now I really don't want to be in this relationship and never want to be in another relationship ever again
also, after I talked to him about moving and breaking up at that time, he started saying that I broke him and that I only love him out of pity
so he ended up in a mental hospital somehow. (I didnt contact the authoroties btw so thats not why)
ok
and I'm extremely stressed out
and he's saying a lot of worrying shit about suicide
but lately he has been seeming extremely clingy and really doesn't want to break up when I move
and he's told people but because he has mental health issues they just bring him to a mental hospital
So I learned that my bf's parents beat him and yell at him all the time
im having serious worries now
ok
oh nvm
um i think you're in the wrong channel
I should do that but I get scared thinking about it
Yeah
the second one is that my boyfriend's parents aren't allowing him to date, and have sometimes threatened him with a gun
originally I didn't think it was serious, but recently something slightly bad happened and his first result was to try to hurt himself
The first is that my boyfriend has suicidal thoughts a lot
So there are two issues
i have something i need to talk to someone about
im glad i have my parents and my psychologist and you guys to talk to
i have been already
but for now I wont ask anyone out when I move
i guess
and we're still gonna stay friends because people can change
and it seems like he took it surprisingly well
I explained why I wanted to break up over text
so my BF got grounded so I couldnt meet with him in person
alright
Thank you all so much
Im very thanful for all of you who can listen to my stupid drama and help me with it
I'm going to explain why our relationship doesnt work and then kindly tell him that I don't want to be in a relationship with him anymore, but still want to be friends because people can change
I'm going to meet with him tomorrow tho
not yet
and then he started texting me again like nothing had happened
and I went home and cried for the rest of the afternoon
and he even threatened suicide if I left
and suddenly he starts yelling at me with all this accusatory shit
and I was talking to him about that when I do we'll have to break up
I was very much attached to him, but in a month I'm moving from NY to DC
ill try to be as gentle as i can tho
like a lot
he hurt my feelings
he is
im just annoyed that he makes me so upset and then is like "oh yeah i was having a bad day, I still love u tho"
and made me cry for an entire afternoon
also he was the one who yelled at me for no reason
well I made it clear that I didnt want to be in a relationship with him
if this goes on I'm going to meet him in person and bluntly state why our relationship is toxic and I don't want to be his boyfriend
my ex boyfriend is texting me acting like we're still in a relationship
Thank fuck
Yay The Donald got quarantined
and I just leave because this entire argument is actually bullshit
and she says "its because you're white and I'm latino"
and so I say this
for the record, I dont play a lot of loud music, and when I do it's at a reasonable volume level
then she gets angry at me and yells at me because supposedly "I'm allowed to play loud music but she's not"
I go over there and turn it down to a level where the whole house can still hear it but can also hear each other
she turns it up to full volume
I ask her to turn the volume down to a reasonable level
I cannot hear myself think
she's blasting her christian music at near top volume
my au pair is such an asshole
F
Fs in chat
Oof
Disney has been a pretty bad company over the years but yeah thought I should put that there
https://i.redd.it/el0uyaxr6y831.png
Wait what's this about
<@173112001684439040> that's great! I crossdress often too
Man who yells at clouds
Like most people I know would not be able to sit through Selected Ambient Works Volume 2
IDK I might listen to them at some point
I'm actually kinda proud of myself for being able to enjoy music that's a lot more subtle
That or too "bleepy bloopy"
Not that my taste is bad, what I meant is that I listen to music that most people would find boring
I have such a boring taste in music
Like half the music I listen to is background music tbh
I much prefer IDM, ambient, and jazz
Unfortunately metal does not play into my tastes
What the shit
?
My "waifu" is mostly just an inside joke, they don't hold any actual meaning to me
I hardly ever listen to anime music anymore
But like
Yeah I read a few manga
I refused to watch anime because it was super time consuming
No
But that's the extent of it
I'm considering potentially getting some anime/manga posters for my new room
I read manga
Like
It's not my primary interest
But like not much
I mean kinda
I'm not a weeb tho
I can't vote unfortunately that year
Just vote for who you hate less
It does
Yeah not voting is an issue
Trump basically says what idiot Americans want to hear, they vote for him, and he fucks things up more
Electioneering is one of my favorite Radiohead songs because it's still relevant 20 years later
I'm not saying it's good
It should be changed tho
Well I mean that was written a long time ago
Yeah they have to be American born
Nah but the demographic for voting is easily influenced idiots
Yeah
If Trump wins a second term I'm writing a will
It sucks here
4chan and shit like that played a part in it didn't it
What was wrong with Clinton btw? At the time of the election I was 12 and didn't care about politics so I don't really know.
What's going on
Most of them are great people
Most of the people I know IRL are Christian
No I'm not saying that all religious people are awful
Those people are actual scum and trash
Catholic schools suck
Look if you think theres some big reward waiting for you after you die as long as you follow some stupid science fiction written thousands of years ago, whatever, just don't force your opinions on me
Fuck hyper-religious people man
So what'll happen to KyoAni?
maybe 60% of them
sort of
but other than that the teachers were nice (one of them was my dad actually)
like it still sucked, we had to get up early
Yeah I didnt have it too bad
^^^^^^^
Sunday School
oh yeah
actually thats about all i know
Theres a goddess called Bridget
I only really know two things because I dont pay attention
because other then the ceremony we dont talk about it often
I dont mind it too much
Celtic in origin i believe
IDK
twice a year we have to go to this ceremony
My mom is also involved with this pagan religion
but the scary thing is sometimes I actually doubt that I'm doing the right thing, which just shows how bad it is to force kids into a religion at a young age
yeah
Thats their idea pretty much
thankfully I stood up to them and I didn't have to be confirmed
because they thought that atheism was "just a phase" pretty much
Although a year ago they were forcing me to go through with confirmtion
My parents are Catholic, but thankfully they've come to understand that I don't believe in any religion
So what now most likely
Dragon Maid S2 isnt happening anymore because of some sick fuck
Conservatives
^
It's probably not why but still
If whoever did this did it because "fuck weebs" I want him burned at the stake
I'd be alright with them starting over
I wouldnt want any of their products to be like that movie
yeah
what do you think will happen to Dragon Maid season 2 now?
^^^^^^^^
Come to think of the snake is pretty much the good guy, he encourages people to question what they blindly believe
theres two sides to the coin
so do i
Even then I'm pretty sure that I can't be in the draft because I have Asperger's
The military wants trained professionals
The draft I don't have to worry about
Nukes
That's not why
Not really a point caus it's doubtful anyone will end up reading it if I die the way I think I'm gonna die
Guess I better write a will
Welp
What's happening
I still refuse to do it unless it becomes legalized
I am not risking jail
Even if it was perfectly fine
Well if it's illegal I'm not doing it anyways
Yeah if theres any chance of slight brain damage I'm out
I was thinking "oh yeah if this becomes decriminalized when I grow up it might not be a terrible idea"
Yeah never mind
Yeah
Especially harmful or addictive I mean
Does it have any harmful properties?
Oh
So I'm really confused if it's illegal or legalized or decriminalized or whatever
I always see people talking about LSD trips everywhere
What's the legality of LSD like?
On another topic
What else can I do
I'm gonna go cut off my foot and get a prosthetic
That's about it most of the time
I drink ginger ale and water
Alcohol in good moderation is alright
?
Cigarette companies should just jump in a hole, pour gasoline on themselves, and light a match
And the worst thing is you end up with second hand smoke even if you don't smoke
And once you start it fucking hooks you in
At all
There's no reason to start
<@279341087494242304> I know we usually disagree but yeah that's a huge agree there
I'm also avoiding becoming alcoholic
Because that's not true
I think parents should stop telling their children that life is great and you can live your dreams when you grow up
Yeah
We'll see
Haha
So I'm really worried
Because I'm only able to make friends easily when I have other friends around
My only worry is making friends in my new state
It's been pretty difficult for us, but it seems to be working out in the end
As a person who is moving several states in under a month
US
Tbh it's a 50/50 that I either snap out of this funk in a couple of days or I might end up legitimately depressed
Well all I can do is hope theres no war going on for the next decade
Wait what?
yeah, I have a psychologist, but because of vacation I haven't seen them in a while
And nowadays I'm often pessimistic and have low self esteem
Its extremely unhealthy for my mental state, I've been doing it for about 2 years I think, and back before it started I was a pretty optimistic person
IDK why but I subconsciously try to find things that make me really worried
I feel like I look for things that make me paranoid
When I grow up I'm refusing to have children
Yeah
It's really not worth it
Last time I physically hurt someone was a long time ago
Man I'm glad I don't do that anymore
I was 12 yeah
I'm not saying I was really justified
I think it was the only time in my life when I have been completely filled with rage
When Trump was elected I actually attacked someone on my bus physically for no reason
Punching people is typically a bad idea
Self defense is ok
Ugh I hate people like Stephen Crowder
(not Solo)
I'm mad at him too
Also he can't do it again now
Well he isn't getting any mod powers
So all I could do is change some things with the bot so it couldn't happen again
But technically he didn't post it
In the rules I said "if you post lolicon and shotacon you get banned"
Because he technically didn't break any rules by using the bot
Now he's mad because I rejected his mod application
Remember the guy who abused the bot in my server to post lolicon and shotacon
And that fucked me up for the next 3 days
When I was 13 one guy was preaching on the street about how "in 3 days God will come as an asteroid and kill us all"
Oh yeah
There's something wrong with me
I can't go a day without getting freaked out about something
I saw the image before the text and panicked for a split second
Thanks Twitter for triggering one or my worst phobias
This is certainly a fascinating story nin!
Holy shit
Why's that bad?
I'm just gonna mute this channel for a bit
yeah
you could have kept that to yourself tho
god i got a brain tumor just saying that
gOD mADE aDAM aND eVE nOT aDAM aND sTEVE
^^^^^^^^
man fuck the catholic church
Unfortunately my family isn't very wealthy so we can't really do that
One of my friends' family's company is donating 5000 dollars to KyoAni
I was wondering if anyone else here has felt anything similar and could offer any insight
So ever since my relationship with my previous boyfriend I've been noticing that when I really think about a romantic relationship, I get a really bad feeling. I don't know what it means.
Can I talk to you guys about something
Everyone sucks and everything is awful
I'm even hesitant about giving the police them
Civilians don't need guns
And a very small minority of those people actually go on to hurt people
An insanely large amount of people play violent video games
Like
I HATE how it's fucking 2019 and the media is still blaming mass shootings on video games
Trump is just a brainlet but unfortunately because he's the president he can't be ignored
White American men, one of which was purposely trying to kill Mexicans
https://i.redd.it/uxxlpo28oke31.jpg
The state of this fucking country
"I need a gun for self defense!!!!!!!!" (Not the SG server)
Fucking people in this one server
i seriously hope it's unconstitutional to ban violent video games
The delusional guy right
YES
It's incredibly ignorant
it's the same logic as PHONE BAD BOOK GOOD
Yeah I posted a meme here before similar to that
There's not a real correlation
Damn
Like I thought I had missed something
Still bad but that seemed really sudden
Oh ok
They're firing at us????
?
Ok
A nuclear one?
Wait firing a missile?
Well still sucks
Oh
I think he said "can be"
But yeah fuck him
Thanks
https://mobile.twitter.com/PardesSeleh/status/1159646635560964097
You're not gonna take away guns but you will take away violent video games?
What the shit Walmart
Yeah
Anyone who thinks that this is "SJW pandering" deep down is just a transphobe probably
Btw I'm not agreeing with this guy
"Oh no my childhood is ruined"
And this is a problem... why?
https://twitter.com/BiscuitBasher/status/1159987145219760128
Yes
My mental state is fucked
Guy is now threatening suicide
I don't know
Alright but I'll make a backup server just in case anything happens
What the fuck do I do I'm unbelievably worried
He should be getting banned
He posted lolicon
I can't report him, the report system doesn't work on mobile
I don't know how to tell discord tho!
I don't know what to do
A banned user is trying to get Discord to shut down my server and report my account
Fuck fuck fuck
"Peaceful" and "racist" don't usually go in the same sentance
I'm sorry I started this
I don't think it's pandering
Yeah no it was Joe Murray's decision
Maybe you've been to the wrong therapist
(thankfully my mom was on the side of letting them)
And it got cancelled this year because they couldn't decide if they could allow trans women in or not
My mom has this women's-only group she goes to once a year
On a slightly related note
Of course
My mom agrees with me that theres an astronomically low chance of that happening
That's like not playing any tapes because there's a tiny chance theyll break when you turn them on
Still doesn't make it any better tho.
Its because they're afraid of a man posing as a trans woman and then being let in. Some of the people in this circle go there because they've been abused by men.
Also I learned that the reasoning behind some of the people in my mom's circle being against letting trans women in
Well 1 view is still better than 6
Really
<@188714906143424513> nah I can just copy the link
I mean saying something bad about immigration is still a lot better than fucking sending nudes to children
ProJared cheated on his wife and sent kids nudes
JonTron said something racist once
I've never watched ProJared and never intend to
I download all of Jontron's videos as mp4s because I don't want to give him views, but his content is still great
Please calm down, this just seems like a misunderstanding
I'll just dip out, I'm not smart enough to have political opinions
Jesus I was really stressed for a second there though
Alright my dad called them and everything's back to how it was originally scheduled now
My stupid fucking hotel just lied to my dad
When we checked in, they said that at 3:00 on Monday, we would have to move to another room
And they said they would move our stuff for us
And now they're saying that we have to move at 1:00 and they will not help us move our stuff at all
I have 15 minutes to pack up and move the entire apartment alone because my dad is at work
"By the time this gets bad I'll be gone already"
Thats the whole mindset of people like Trump towards climate change
Yeah but kudos to Illinois!
https://twitter.com/13WREX/status/1160892696363450368
Also I hate hotels
It does absolutely nothing for me
See I might just as well look at a picture of a cool place rather than visit it
When I leave home I always get into awful situations like this
I just don't like leaving home
Im not a traveler
It's literally like being in a plane but it's on the ground
My aunt is one of those people who thinks you have to unconditionally love your family for no reason other then them being your family
I'm seeing if I can get a train back to NY for a bit so I don't have to deal with my extended family
I'd rather just sleep in the closet that's too small for me to fit
I have to share a room with my sister and my dad
I swear to god I've gotta get out of this hotel
She seems really upset that our au pair is staying with us even though it doesn't seem so bad to me
I'm starting to think that my aunt is a little racist
I'm probably centrist but I typically have more left opinions
Best wishes to them
That ended shortly before I turned 13
I used to follow FNaF stuff when I was like 10
You know what?
I'm not scared of being in a relationship.
Because a romantic partner isn't someone who is incredibly attached to you and can only talk about how much they love you and never want you to leave, but doesn't care about the real you.
A romantic partner should respect you. They will care about the real you and talk to you like any other human being, but they still love you and you love them too.
Ok
Hope it goes well
<:this:450570253114802197>
<@246146781832806401> what did this person identify as?
It was super generic
Wonder Woman wasn't a very good movie tho
I'm mostly angry at part B
Look I'm just saying there's reasons other than transphobia for someone to not date a trans person
Of course
B) I don't need to explain what's wrong with this point
A) it's perfectly fine to not be sexually attracted to trans people as long as you still support them
How are both sides of this argument wrong

How can Twitter allow this and how have they not been attacked for it?
Found some Twitter accounts that actually have "Age of consent needs to go" in their fuckin bios.
I see posts with the word all the time
They have not banned it
Wdym on the second part
Any pointers on how to improve this?
```Hello Holofan:

I am aware that you do not permit "transphobic" content on r/animemes. However it has come to my attention that the word "trap" is thrown around a lot on the subreddit. A majority of the LGBTQ+ community consider this word to be a transphobic slur. Even if the word is used towards characters who are just crossdressers or have a feminine design, it's still quite degrading to refer to them as "traps". I am kindly asking you and the other mods to remove posts that use this word because they directly violate rule 5, which states: "No sexist/racist/homophobic/transphobic language."

Thank you, and have a good day.```
And that could cause some serious issues here
I really should avoid this channel because I'm really bad at wording things
Yeah I didn't mean all trans people
I think that's a valid reason
But that's because they scarred me mentally by threatening suicide multiple times
I would not date my ex (who is trans) again
I mean
If you don't want to date a trans person because they don't have the set of genitals you prefer, that's not so bad
What I think Melua and Saki are saying is that if you won't date a trans person because deep down you don't like trans people that's transphobic
My last boyfriend was trans
In any case I don't really mind if my partner is trans or not
Fuck xenophobes
Oh that's fucking corrupt
whats wrong with BJ again?
I'm trying to convince my mom to have me go to a different school
I think their program for students with autism is designed for students on the lower-functioning end
This is the wrong school or at least the wrong program for me
They'll get swallowed into a sea of tens of thousands of other students
Because I know I'll never see them again after
I can't talk to anyone in this school
<@476058996315389953> Man Twitter is a great platform, people can have "I love little girls, end the legal age of consent" in their bios, but when one person says something they don't agree with bam you can't speak anymore
Funimation is having a bad couple of weeks
But the thing is because I'm autistic half of my classes are in this program
Yeah
High school
It's supposedly one of the best schools in the state
4 days
It's awful, I don't know if I'll ever be able to make friends
(I've just realised I say "particularly" a lot)
I don't watch his videos, they don't particularly interest me, but I don't particularly dislike him
I'm not saying he doesn't have a good portion of alt right fans btw but I just wanna make sure no one's generalizing his whole fanbase as that
I mean ngl PewDiePie is the biggest YouTuber, there's probably some people there who don't even watch his videos or subscribe to him
Organized religion fucking sucks
Theres like one part where John or someone rebukes some gay people for not wanting to be with women
I hope I'm overreacting and people here are actually really nice
That sounds awful
But the kids there think autism is a disease
Yeah if that was all it was I wouldn't be so worried
I want to crossdress again
Which worries me a lot
I'm starting to think we live in a very conservative area of the state
So my dad told me that he went to a church and the priest there gave a very homophobic sermon
If I didn't already feel out of place I now feel totally unwelcome
I just overheard some kids in P.E. joking about autism and saying it was a disease
I hate myself
and no one can move it because of how territories are spkit
someone literally placed the ladder in an odd position
there was a standoff over a ladder
thats actually hillarious
Yet we have churches üôÉ <@182890099183190018>
Thought u were talking about the US
Sorry
US
No
Does the civil war count as a race war?
yay another PewDiePie iz facist discussion
Discussion isn't so serious anymore
Maybe move somewhere else
Yeah everyone's subconsciously racist
Nah everyone's racist
And Satan led humans to intelligence and freedom
God imprisoned humans and kept them from knowing better
If you think about it
Lmao
That all sounds so dumb
(this is the guy who released one of his best albums under a different name and for a while refused to say that it was his album)
I seriously doubt based on his personality that hes in support of Boris
I think Richard just did that to fool with everyone, seems like something he would do
during a live show Aphex Twin showed an image of Boris Johnson on screen and half the crowd was still cheering and some people were booing
There's a YouTuber I watch who dresses feminine and people on the internet constantly try to convince him he's trans even though he isn't
*Overhead the albatross,
Lies motionless within the air*

I have a goal in this world and I couldn't die before I reach it

What is that?
Because I have Asperger's
Do you think it will be hard for me to find a job when I grow up?
<@195919956918009856> nah real guys are definitely cool too
Because I'm attracted to some girls but for the most part over the last year or so guys have just seemed worlds more attractive
I don't know if I'm gay or bi
I'm really confused about my sexuality

Please let's not fight
valk server's pretty cool but one of the regulars seems to have some sort of hatred for me and bullies me every chance he can get. the mods dont do anything about it so i decided i dont need to subject myself to that shit
They just hype every goddamn thing up
I should probably ignore Twitter
So right now I guess I don't have to worry
I live in a liberal state just right next to the south
Also
Yeah
America
Why are people talking about a civil war????
Thank fuck

^
sorry i had to get this shit off my chest, it's been irking me a lot for quite a while
also its fine to maybe write a fan story or theorize about these characters being trans as long as you can acknowledge that that may not be canonically true
like i wouldnt be mad at someone for at first thinking astolfo or etc is trans when they first find out about him but like when they start vehemently denying that he's canonically referred to as a man several times it becomes bullshit
trying to force "____ is totally trans" when they clearly aren't annoys me a lot
ugh

That is true I suppose
Maybe a one-bullet handgun
And civilians can't buy big assault rifles
Scary
It's a literal get-out-of-jail-free card if you can pull it off
That's disturbing
You don't need an assault rifle for self defense. Assault rifles are designed for mass killing. Civilians should not own something specifically designed for mass killing.
When I bring this up in other places, people always argue against me and it makes me a little scared that all people deep down just want to kill each other
Civilians should not be able to own assault rifles
That's why we need background checks to be way better
i think it was a clip from Love Lab
what the fuck is that all about?
ive been seeing this one image of some anime girls blackfacing on twitter recently
fuck neo nazis
My mental state has been on a downward spiral for a while tbh, just haven't noticed until now
I think I'm actually depressed. For a while I thought I wasn't depressed because I don't feel like I wish I were dead, but honestly thats just because of a few things my life has going for it (like my friends and music and video games).  My goal in life was to have a very successful music career but I've realized that that's almost completely impossible, so now my life sort of feels aimless, as if I'm just waiting for that next time something sort of fun happens. This really isn't helped by my parents stressing me out, the state of politics, climate change, guns and the fear of being killed in a mass shooting, homophobia, and just about everything else in the world, in fact it all makes everything worse. I feel like theres nothing I can do about anything and it always feels like there are people with a higher status that get to decide how my life goes. Although life is preferable to the alternative at this point I don't know by how much.

we should play some TF2 sometime
its a better game anyways
ive decided to go back to TF2
(i stole this from a friend and idk where he got it from tbh)

ugh
but at the same time
but theyre taking steps in the right direction and i want to play overwatch really badly
like this is still bad
i honestly dont know if i should continute boycotting
TLDR
his sentance was halved and he gets the prize money

(except for the incel guy i was talking about a few days ago)
I'm ever thankful (almost) everyone around me was supportive of me when I came out


And then someone else edited it
Some dipshit decided to make an entry for Astolfo
So there's this "transgender anime" wiki
I know
I don't play StarCraft multiplayer anyways so I'll continue to not play it
It's a tough desicion to make
Overwatch would have probably survived had Blizzard done nothing
Personally I view it like this: Overwatch is so huge that we're just a couple of crumbs in this cake
Me and my friends have decided that since lots of staff and devs didn't want this to happen, we will continue to play the Blizzard games that we already own, but we will not give Blizzard any money.
^
Yeah GNC I probably should've looked up before mentioning
Anyways if Astolfo was born male and identifies as male logically he is not trans and therefore an entry of him in the "transgender anime" wiki is unnecessary and factually incorrect
Sorry I briefly forgot what GNC meant
Is what I'm trying to say
So he is male
And identifies as such
Astolfo is biologically male
Well ok
Ew
Sorry I intruded
Do you think that Chick Fil A can be shut down?
I mean, do you have any objective benifit to my living?
When I turn 18
And like I just have a sort of immediate reaction to not want to kill myself but objectively that might be the right choice
Society wouldn't be burdened by my lack of talent at anything
But if I didn't survive then my parents wouldn't have to feed me
My life stops being enjoyable and starts being horrible
Because by that point
I'm starting to think that it would be objectively better for everyone if I didn't live past age 18
One of my best friends schools was nearly one of those schools
Everyone else is happy and laughing and I'm terrified of everyone around me
What I'm confused by is that I'm the only one scared in my school
Yeah I guess I should just be homeschooled then
I mean I'd prefer if bags were checked but I guess freedom is more important
It's not like anyone checks bags so there's nothing stopping anyone
It's probably a bad idea but I cannot let myself go to school where anyone can just bring a gun in their bag
Tomorrow I'm considering locking myself in my room and refusing food until I'm homeschooled
I'm convinced safety and freedom cannot exist both at once
I really wish I had a therapist but we've been trying to contact one for months and none of them ever responded
Lately I've been thinking that every human just wants to kill everyone around them, whether it's concious or subconscious. I really shouldn't think this.
I'm starting to think that i should institutionalize myself
I hate the second amendment a lot
This school is full of actual psychos
School is boring and a shooting would be interesting
They're logic:
Get me the fuck out of here
They are betting on who will do it
People in my school are actually excited for the possibility of a school shooting
I no longer plan to kill myself
I've calmed down
Ok what is it?
When I get home I'll just take it easy
Gun laws exist and are followed but they definitely have room to improve
Both of you have a point
Ok it wasn't my intention to cause an argument
Like, is everyday life so horrible that you'd rather fear for your lives?
But what those kids said just spooked me so much
I wish I could stop the fear because I know it's unreasonable
^
not a shooting
i havent lived life yet
i dont wanna die
that would be marching to my death
i cant go to school tomorrow
fuck
no no no
<@!203444794737950720> like, if they got in trouble they would know it was me
i didnt overhear it
no the kids were telling me this
i ended up telling the teachers
i hope those guys at school dont go after me
~~thank fuck~~
i really associated myself with the wrong people there
they said once "we saw some black woman on a train trying to take our seat, so we told her "hey this place is racist. whos gonna believe a black woman over 3 white guys" and threatened to beat her up
i doubt they really did that but its still fucked up
theyve made kkk jokes
that wasnt the first fucked up thing my friends said
im not gonna lie
In any case that guy seems like a prime example of that comic
Well, I scrolled up i mean
Read the chat logs
Like obviously r/dankmemes and r/animemes are gonna be unfunny
Depends on where you are tho
^
Most anime memes are typically unfunny
Probably not the right place to discuss this
im 100% exxagerating but i cant get my mind off it
i dont want them to beat me up
Yeah fuck Sankaku then
It's journalism hell
Yeah
OAG is like Kotaku but alt right
Ye
Is it as bad as OAG?
It's a text so I can't tell if he genuinely is apologizing and I'm worried
I don't know what to do but I feel vaguely bad.
He apologized and was wondering if anything would make me feel more comfortable
One of the guys texted me back
So uh
Just had a close call, one of them walked by but somehow didn't notice me
Yeah
I got kicked out and was forced to go over to this corner of the building where A. There are no teachers B. Those two psychos could come around at any time
They said they would have the office open for me to stay at lunch
Nice my teachers lied to me
But then there are subreddits like r/comedyheaven which don't usually have formats that people can abuse
Yeah
Melua had a better guess
Idk
Child Sexual Erotic Material?
I guess but I've seen people posting actual loli rape shit so it doesn't make sense to me
But after I learned why I decided that although I don't like r/animemes Reddit was just being dumb
At first i was in support of Reddit because fuck that shit eating subreddit
Remember when Reddit banned that one r/animemes mod for posting a picture of Kaguya in a bikini
I've met several of those people
We're doing quite well for ourselves now actually in the new server
And me making a new server where the mods aren't lolicon supporters
Which resulted in the server falling apart
Well I guess he was convincing enough that I was removed from mod staff for bannning him
It was so fuckin dumb
Ik but one guy posted it had a loophole that made it allowed
I've banned lolicon from my server
Yeah
But like
Yeah it does
My mom said once she doesn't like it because it "objectifies women" and didn't elaborate
Also some people just think porn in general is bad. I never hear why tho.
Is he in jail?
Oh my lord
Homophobic people aren't homophobic because of the Bible, they ration that because a religious text says it's bad then they aren't in the wrong for thinking it's bad (or they were brainwashed by these people at a young age)
Yeah
<@472513526393602059> people don't like different

That's disturbing
My friend was a Trump supporter because he had little political knowledge, when I explained the whole thing to him he decided that he didn't want to support Trump
I would have never thought of that but we gotta stay hopeful and make positive changes
Well if someone wanted to make that law he would be in support of it which is still scary
You can't make someone straight if they aren't
Exactly
Its completely disgusting and I can see Pence legalizing them
<@472513526393602059> basically, parents send their LGBTQ kids there and they beat them and abuse them to try to turn them cis/straight
So I'm in a bit of a moral stalemate right now
I can't support Trump's presidency but at the same time I can't support something that will lead to my friends being beaten and abused
I don't want Trump in office, but if he's impeached and Mike Pence takes office and legalizes conversion camps, several of my friends would be sent to them and be abused
I'm really conflicted about this
I've been worried about Mike Pence lately
nukes give me anxiety so im gonna just mute this chat
<:Hugstolfo:470718305527791637>
You will do well!
Maybe not physical violence
Violence
See look
I don't want to live in a world like this
Everyone wants to kill everyone else just a little at least.
I actually just don't want to be around people
School shooters want to generate fear
The front desk literally had threatening notes taped to it
<@99695384296701952> well then what can I do to protect myself?????
My parents dont care. School is more important than my wellbeing
I'm gonna die anyways so
Honestly idk
My parents are still making me go to school
If I stop being active here you'll know why
This world is beyond fucked. It will never come back.
And those who don't want to kill want to be killed
I almost want to die at this point. I don't want to live in a world where all the kids want to kill each other.
My school has now gotten shooting threats
And sometimes a lot
Theres a little bit of hatred in everyone
I'm saying
I'm not saying they are equal
And theres hatred in mass killings
Theres hatred in this argument
<@284390402210136064> but usually there's no hatred involved in chess
No we survived because of a fluke
yeah i should just disable my account honestly before i spew more garbage

i cant quite remember who said it
hold on
soemone on discord, i cant remember who but someone i trust
no i remember being told once that i shouldnt see a therapist until Im 18 because if I do they can sell my info
thankfully im seeing my therapist today who definitely wont sell my information
Without threats I'm already a little scared of everyone around me
If they don't release any more info I really do not feel safe going to school on Monday
The police deemed it not credible but didn't say anything about it otherwise
Basically the school was threatened on social media
They haven't told me why the threat isn't credible or what the threat was, so I can't possibly believe them.
I don't feel like I can trust the police or anyone
idk what im gonna do
still freaked out
Go under a bed
Ok just make sure that they can't see you
I don't have the best judgement but I would hide and call the police
Ok. Are you in a public place or your home?
Tbh I don't know a lot about EA but from what i know 76 is worse than any EA game
76 was not
They were at least fixable
Tbh, EA has been shitting out horrible games for a while, and the only nightmarishly bad game Bethesda has put out so far has been Fallout 76
^^^
Hey at least it ain't Bethesda!
I once saw a meme where it was comparing some games with deep political undertones that everyone was ok with, but then Battlefield 5 with a woman and everyone screaming STOP PUTTING POLITICS IN GAMES

I never said that
Not trying to defend them too much tho because they are still horrible people
I heard that they improved it slightly. It's still really bad tho.
What is going on here
There's a balance to be had
Its all going down the drain
Ah
Elaborate
?
^
<@284390402210136064> it was tagged in the tweet
That's something else entirely
Its not worth #metoo
Yeah but like
Ah yes because people aren't allowed to have big breasts.

they dont exist either
just like birds
its still not good but at least i can see where they could have gotten that idea
i can sort of understand a little if theyve been raped in the past but still
fuck those hypocrites
yeah people who say "men are trash"
oh yeah remember when that one guy joined the server and was like "the characters are not gay because i am against gay people" or something like that
ok
oh
ok but what was the LGBT part about?
what do yo mean by that rady?
wait im confused
eh nah
i didnt know about genderfluid people until now
But I also used to thought attack helicopter was big funny
That's what I used to think
ok so
help
because I don't think they just randomly sent someone nsfw
I mean idk why
I seen an 18+ friend get banned literally for just sending another 18+ person an NSFW image in DMs
look at the end of the day I just don't want to see them banned over stupid shit
if they got banned their relationship would be ruined
they don't know each other IRL tho
I can't understand why as I literally just saved their fucking relationship
one of them blocked me
I have no way of knowing but thats what they've said
I guess they've deleted the nudes
and they seem to be deleting them
I've told both of them to delete them
I'm pretty sure they can get banned for this so I'm trying to make sure those get deleted
and apparently they've sent each other nudes over Discord
one of them is 15 and one is 16
i have two online friends who are dating
I'm bad at his don't listen to me tho
maybe ask them: "hey just curious, are you by any chance into guys/girls?"
tough question
yeah tbh if I'm in a relationship with someone I would want to be able to go on dates with them and cuddle fairly often
but I can respect people who can
not something i can do either
in fact theres actually a guy I met online who I'm in love with but we aren't gonna start a relationship because we live decently far away
tbh a lot of my friends are edating
also, idk what asking formally would be
idk just casually asking if someone wants something sexual seems odd to me
I'm not uninterested but like
like one time my now-ex asked if I wanted a blowjob and it totally creeped me out
but like even if it was someone i was in a relationship in
I can't place why it skeeves me out
idk
definitely not but like
I just find it really weird and gross
like, imagine asking someone for a picture of their body or asking someone of they would like to see your own body (or even worse, just sending it to them with no context)
tbh yesterday's situation made me realize that i just find the concept of nudes in general really creepy
internet arguments are just IM RIGHT AND YOUR WRONG on both sides
I think the fear that everyone can hear my thoughts is because of my parents complete disregard for my privacy
tbh
but what did you mean anyways?
I know they can't but i can't shake the feeling
I've always felt like people knew exactly what I'm thinking at all times
but when it's a real person, i feel like some kind of awful pevert
<@472513526393602059>?
if it's just some anime character, they don't care about me so it doesn't matter
idk I just feel like a creep when I think sexual thoughts about someone I know personally or IRL
i think it might be that I have a mental wall that prevents me from being sexually attracted to people I personally know
so it's fucking weird seeing these memes
thing is I knew about the normal CBT before the meme CBT
wrong chat
in all seriousness, good for you
~~HAHA FUNNY THREE LETTERS~~
idk just one that isnt so out of the blue
that's not what I mean
ive seen the first season of the show
well i knew kazuma was an asshole already
yeah
its fine
is it just the media being dumb again
it is?
is the scene actually transphobic or not?
so i heard about the new Konosuba movie
i mean, i havent read the LN
^
i mean yeah i guess they should wait a few years before that
a bigger age difference would become illegal
so like in my state, thats like the edge of legality
could be wrong
actually i dont think the megukazu ship is that weird, isnt megumin 14 and kazuma 16?
<:15min:495770478678638593>
he should steal mens underwear and dropkick it too
if he truly advocates for gender equality
thanks for explaining it
alright
ok sorry I was confused on your point
yeah ik but doesn't mean it should be justified
that's even creepier
did I read something wrong?
ok that's just weird
wait they got married?????
Kazuma is an insufferable douche and Megumin is Megumin
change my mind
their marriage would fail
tbh if Kazuma and Megumin got married when they were older
I fucking hate the "its just drawings" argument
so I take it Grizz was a lolicon?
what even happened while i wss gone
I think thats how most of us feel Saki
have a nice sleep
gn
so no one really regrets it
thankfully when he got banned, by that time everyone had realized how disgusting and shitty he was
and it's been great since then
well it was once a week until this guy finally got banned for the last time
which he used as a justification against banning him
<@246146781832806401> apparently it's under warning rather than instant ban, which is dumb if you ask me
well he didn't directly post it, he actually used a Tatsumaki command
it was possibly the most bullshit situation I've ever been involved with
and given most of the people in the server were around 14 and were good friends with him at the time, they went on his side
yeah
(I'm a mod there)
what he did was post lolicon in the general chat and then blame me for not saying "lolicon is banned and no NSFW in general" in the rules
(different server)
he manipulated other users in the server to defend him
I had to deal with a lolicon once
its like, it doesn't make it much less fucked up
i wasnt starting shit, they brought it up
nah
<:BikkiFacepalm:398808522952933377>
she was basically saying "you younglings and your labels"
bruh my mom was talking about ok boomer at lunch today
in reality all the corporations are just telling us that they're trying to fix things, but they really aren't
tbh we aren't gonna fix anything but we'll say we saved Earth
thats how i felt with watching anime
same
idk about British politics but just from reading these chat logs Dino seems very very biased
that's how I feel most of the time but this morning it's different for some reason
other than maybe getting to see my crush, which isn't a high possibility because he lives really far away, my life has little to no meaning, and I listen to so many albums to distract myself from this
such a stupid fucking system
idk it just seems impossible to get anywhere in life
but idk, you have to have a really really good GPA to get into a semi decent college anyways
also idk if this is just my parents blowing things out of proportion, but they say that I have to spend four years in college if i want a job at all
(which would be exaggerated but you get the idea)
so I could say I'm very creative rather than that I have Asperger's
well thank you for telling me
idk I don't know a lot about this
I don't?
they'll look at me resume, see that i have Asperger's, and think "oh he's objectively inferior to everyone else applying, pass"
that isn't the issue
I guess today is "think about things too much day" for me
because I have Asperger's
I'm scared that if I grow up and a music career doesn't work out, it'll be hard for me to find a job
YouTube is run by some of the most scummy and backhanded people I've ever heard of
we want a better platform
we dont want youtube two
^
theres some shady shit on the frontpage tho
doesnt look like it yet tho
something i found, would be nice if one day it or a similar site killed youtube
https://d.tube/
i feel that sometimes
this is a whole new level of fucked
the government is fucking over youtube basically
t
fuck this shi
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0veLrwd9CK4&feature=youtu.be
I'm gonna protest against this
it sucks
the rules will still apply even if the law doesn't. people outside the US won't be fined but will still be set to kids mode
it will
yeah, i think it's kind of a toxic mindset
so can someone sum up last night's debate for me?
tbh I wonder all the time what my crush would think if I suddenly died
found this in my feed
https://twitter.com/onlineryn/status/1197279704321056769
if they nuked the US, from what i understand they would be completely anhilated
I doubt this "Christmas present" from North Korea is a nuke
https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/05/nyregion/rkelly-aaliyah.html
i have too
<@472513526393602059> they are actually very liberal outside of their views of technology
my grandfather is a bit on the eh side but other than that they're pretty nice
my family is mostly alright
I hate my school unbelievably
silently though because they know about me crossdressing and could probably spread it around school
so yesterday I decided to cut ties with my two IRL friends after finding out that they are racists
(messages sent in the wrong order tje first time)
I'm gonna talk to my parents. this has been happening for a while and I think my parents are starting to understand
that's what i believe too
theres been two shooting threats within the first semester
so the school lied to my parents about offering counseling, and the students here from what I've observed are racist and homophobic and the school barely does anything
I'm gonna try to get my parents to let me switch schools because I absolutely despise my current school.
it got me worried at first until I logically thought about it
I'm just a worrywart
(or at least not China)
and since they attacked first no one will help them
even if you know you're ok it doesn't always stop the anxiety
I speak from experience
anxiety can cause you to repeatedly bring up topics you are anxious about.
no I can understand being anxious. I was too initially. I took a step back to think about it and there's not much evidence that points to nuclear war.
they have no good enough reason to
even if they did nuke the US they'd be totally demolished afterwards
probably not gonna get a good scholarship
why is the educational system so broken and why does every single attempt to fix it make it worse
reading about college debt and stuff just makes me want to game end myself when I turn 18
sounds like my parents
best to do something you enjoy and not think about it too much
yeah
because inside you're really panicked and don't want to admit it. I guess I can't really speak for Fig but that's what it looks like to me.
because then it's really hard to get a job
im under the impression that it's actually worse if you're a minor
my mom (I asked her it as a hypothetical and said we were talking about it in my Government class)
they just lock them all up
according to my source they don't even test everyone
oh
charged?
yeah doing a bit of research, it seems like even if you didn't do drugs you'd still get arrested
so just to be on the safe side i asked them if they could maybe not be high and they said yeah
I don't think so. I've considered it but I've been told my whole life not to do drugs.
at least in a public chat
don't feel like saying the specific state
Mid atlantic east cost USA
it's not allowed
it's mostly just I'm scared of getting arrested for something I didn't do
I'm not sure what to do
apparently they're gonna be high
some friends invited me to hang out at their house but
need y'all's advice on something
never ever
B) I have to talk to my therapist about 3 hours after the hangout, so is this a bad idea?
A) what is a reccomended amount
ok so i have some questions
my mom once mentioned she didnt mind drug dealers having insanely long sentances because "they give drugs to kids" soooooo id be completely fucked anyways
also even if the police dont give me too much trouble
well, i mean im not exactly uncomfortable with the drugs, its more of the paranoia you mentioned
if i can be happy without something and theres a great risk to get it, then i wont get it
honestly until now ive lived by the philosophy i said above
and i can live without it
but if it happens im totally screwed
it would be objectively bad for me but
like
its mostly in the context of my earlier conversation here
hey
should i always take life so seriously?
idk i cant explain why but i have kind of a mental roadblock
like
idk im curious about trying but
I can't be in a situation where my mind isnt under my control
no!
but like this is how I've been brought up. to not trust people with drugs.
so yeah. I'm not even sure if I want to go even if they're not doing drugs
and talking to my mom, she said I can still be arrested as an accomplice
thats not how it's been presented to me
this too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4jJOk5MpFM
would be insane
their first two albums
oh man
tbh theres a LOT of music thatd probably be interesting to listen to while high
ive decided that if my friends seem like they are being super irresponsible i wont but ill consider it if it seems like they arent taking too much
also idk how responsible my friends are
because im not sure of myself and my parents
im not gonna try it
ok
weed i mean
and its not addictive right?
maybe I should start by just enjoying the contact high
two idiots with their heads in the clouds
they say "Iran doesn't have the technology to nuke us"
my parents are idiots
?
because of this
should I ask my parents to move away from DC?
what happened seems genuinely serious and Twitter's trending tab makes it hard to figure out the actual ramifications when everyone's screeching at the top of their lungs
they will take every opportunity to get "WW3" on trending
ok so I'm really starting to get annoyed at Twitter even more now.
so yeah went to my friends house, he didn't even bring up talk of weed. maybe he was just empty bragging idk. but it was fun anyways. probably for the better anyways.
fuck this dumbass shit
we cannot let this happen
no. he has a scarily high chance of being reelected, from what I've seen
Trump cannot serve another term. Fuck that.
ugh I'm freaked out
~~maybe the powers that be are trying to test me~~
I wanted to be so optimistic this year and its not even 5 days in and everything is fucked
maybe we will, maybe we won't, but we have the capacity to
we can do it tho.
I feel like
as important as it is to be realistic sometimes pessimism can easily be mistaken for realism
which we can
hopefully for the better, as in, not as violent and belligerent
no matter how small it is
honestly I still feel like there is some possibility out there that humanity can fix itself and become peaceful.
it seems like there's a lot of pessimism going around and it makes me anxious
maybe I should stay off the internet entirely for a long time because of all the WW3 memes
I love to see Discord optimistic
what if all the civilizations joined though
yes.
i vaguely remember something but i dont have the best memory
I think China is remaining neutral? could be wrong tho
fuck now im anxious again
My server doesn't have a shitposting channel but we're making one
i mean, they're really nice places and usually I like talking to people there unlike Reddit or Twitter
I dont use Reddit and Twitter much anymore
the other Symphogear server and r/anime I don't browse that often tbh
r/Anime is mostly shitposting, my server is also a lot of shitposting but it's way of keeping up with my friends
they helped me to be less pretentious
r/Music is actually a super nice and wholesome place, most of the people there are seperated from the subreddit and have very varying tastes in music
just in general. not this sever but the other Symphogear server, r/Music, r/Anime and my own server
the only social media that i browse consistently
and YouTube
Discord
I'm pretty sure that won't happen if things go as they should
bruh
I can't quite place why
but they still make me anxious
I understand that
but still its fucking disgusting
i mean i guess its not the school system as a whole
fuck the american school system
this actually makes me feel sick to my stomach
https://graphics.chicagotribune.com/illinois-seclusion/index.html
why?
my friend got a 3D printer and was watching a video on how to 3D print a working gun. should I be worried?
rest in peace
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/neil-peart-rush-obituary-936221/amp/
I mean think about all the things that give you any amount of joy. You don't wanna lose those do you?
I think his point is that Nazis/white supremacists see all these white (appearing) people in anime and think "wow. it's like a white ethnostate". Not a very good point imo but still.  <@99695384296701952>
yeah that's how I feel
although he does bring up one point in the video that I disagree with which is that "anime is designed to appeal to Nazis" which he doesn't elaborate a whole lot on (he does bring up that most anime characters are white which is a valid point but I'm not sure it entirely explains anime appealing to Nazis)
I've lost what little faith I had left in the anime community
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=AVa9Hps1sks
was about to say
although some of the articles could have been about mushrooms
some articles I found. I'd have to do some digging to find them again.
I've heard from multiple sources drugs are a no no if you already take some kind of medication
I didn't know that smoking weed is literally deadly for people who have to take meds
oh yeah also I'm really glad i ended up not smoking weed because I would have died
I'm feeling awful. I haven't talked about this before but there's lots of things normal people enjoy that i don't enjoy. The only thing that gives me actual satisfaction anymore is loud noises and that's damaging to my hearing which I'm already noticing is slipping away. My focus is terrible and also I can only focus on one thing at a time.  I hate my life.
for several reasons
by their logic i think, gay people haven't made any achievements and therefore don't need a flag, which is factually incorrect
exactly
<:tyler:590662019972333568>
I've seen some people say "gay people aren't a country, they don't need a flag"
I mean even if the rainbow is associated with gay is that really a bad thing?
the colors aren't blended in the gay pride rainbow? idk
I told him to just own it like a chad
had an argument with my friend today who claims that "gay people ruined the rainbow. I can't draw a rainbow without being called gay now"
whenever I try to block out anxiety and negative thoughts they mold together and eventually bust through a metaphorical wall and completely ruin at least the rest of the day
I'll remember that Fizzy
and it worked somehow
yeah. I made friends by just blindly walking up to people and asking them how they've been
^
and you can't really change that so no point in trying
from my observation
it's all about your confidence. you can be the most boring shmuck but if you're super extroverted people will talk to you more
people still avoid you
honestly even if you are an interesting person nothing really changes
I'm anxious rn
funny enough ive never actually RP'd
context
?
so  I assume I'm fine
ok so only some of the sites were saved interestingly and that one list was not
yeah
because people sign in on different accounts
oh. well anyways they use Chromebooks so I'm not sure if my history is saved or not
yeah but the school administration blocks that I think
chrome
nah I'm aware I'm probably fine and that this is just anxiety.
it's just a list of bad album art
<@122219992358846468> I don't think you can delete your history but honestly that wouldn't matter because the url isnt really suspicious
not really my cup of tea
it's a genre of music. I think it's basically superfast electronic music with lots of anime girl samples.
man I wish my brain wouldn't jump to the worst possible conclusion to literally everything
ok I'm overthinking it. even if the school called me to the office or something I could just explain that it was an accident and they probably would just tell me to be careful tbh.
(basically lolicore is a genre, and a lot of lolicore albums have gross lolicon album art)
basically I was doing what i usually do during free periods which was browsing RateYourMusic lists on the school computer and I was browsing a "worst album covers"  list and one of them was a lolicore album
i cant usually tell VAs apart lol
when i watch anime
yeah I don't really think about VAs or studios much
its unfortunate
so
My friend watches a lot of youtube
i remember an E;R video popping up in everyones reccomendations that was about why Steven Universe sucks. From what I know about E;R he seems far right.
I've noticed that alt right people often make fun of the left for being triggered over everything which I find ironic
yeah.
what do you mean by that?
although i dont think he's a bad person at heart. I think hes down the alt right rabbit hole, but not irreversably deep
as in "SJWs and feminists are ruining society"
he's kind of got the gamer mindset, this person
so I overheard my friend talking about cartoons, and he mentioned he thought Steven Universe sucked and was "too LGBT". I asked him what he meant by that and he wouldnt give me a clear answer. I've never seen Steven Universe, is he just being homophobic or does he actually have a point?
but yeah I'm past that
in fact, that reminds me i need to listen to a k pop album sometime
I don't think I will ever avoid something just because of the fandom
"fuck it, imma do it" (or replace imma do it with whatever you need to be confident about)
anyways I cleared things up with the mods. I edited my messages to tell people to talk to me in DMs
we eventually banned one specific user and then the drama mostly stopped
yeah our server was like that for a while lol
I mean people were asking me and I didn't want to lie to them. I didn't just randomly say" ___ did it"
yeah
what I should have done is just DM'd the specific people that were asking
I see what you're saying. But yeah the mod team are worried about drama breaking out.
well I named one but like even if I didn't name them they were very open about being dating so they would have put two and two together
no
and now some of the other mods are mad at me because it's supposedly a "complete invasion of privacy"
anyways fast forward to now, some people were wondering where he went so I told them about it
yeah
a few months ago we had to ban a user because he was lying about his age to younger users (some as young as 12) in order to edate them and may have even sent them nude photos
so as you probably know by now that I run a small server
gotta ask y'all something
so shes going to see her psychiatrist tomorrow and the plan is to tell them then
i dont know her adress
thankfully there is one witness and also photographic evidence of the bruises so if she can somehow contact the police she'll probably be safe
I feel nothing but disgust for a parent who beats their children. They are some of the worst people I can possibly imagine.
so i just learned that one of my best online friends is being abused by their father
but yeah on the internet people are generally negative
I really want to drop my pessimistic habits
I try to
lately I've been sort of realizing that I subconsciously think that people automatically expect the absolute worst in me
I didn't like it much but like it's a fucking YouTube abridged parody
idk what to say
damn
what happened?
nah. what about it?
and removed sensitive information
is there a name for this kind of thinking?
they want me to take some career class that I can still take without an extra year
they were super vague about it
I think this is more proof that they never want me to grow up
so my parents want me to do a 5th year of high school
see what I'm hoping for is a schedule where I can schedule 4 episodes and still have a few hours of total free time
but I shouldn't just do things based on urges
I have to push myself to give a shit. Once I do I start to enjoy it
because I don't have "urges" to watch anything
maybe I should just keep scheduling everything
but i still cant shake the idea that i *should* be doing something else
and its great
im just chilling and listening to music and playing a game
so yeah tl;dr my dad isnt really listening to me when I bring up genuine problems with the system
ok I'm here now
hes been pulling ahead lately I think
i mean I dont have a big knowledge of politics but I guess if I had to pick Bernie seems like tje besr candidate
good news: as I thought, my therapist is totally on my side in this issue and we have a meeting with my parents scheduled in about a week
one is kind of conservative but the others are decently liberal so we'll see how this goes
im actually getting pronoun roles set up in my server if the mods agree
I'm not a huge fan of being called "they"
just makes everything so much easier
ok was reading the argument earlier and I very much reccomend pronoun roles
oh ok
(how old are you? just wondering)
id reccomend going out by yourself maybe
do you have any IRL friends?
wouldn't we probably be suspicious if that high of a number of people were dying and being covered up?
yeah I would think fear is a bad thing
(it's not mine btw)
I'm not sure if this is good or bad advice

the other two haven't voted
one of the mods agrees with me and one doesn't so far
topical meme

chances are you aren't gonna get it
but I don't think it's good in this case if you're just some random person in the U.S.
that's probably how I would feel if my parents left me home alone
<@!183785454447886346> same age as me, 15
she found her old laptop which she is using to communicate with me
(this started a little while ago)
no, she's home now
on Discord
DMs
from how she's talked about it it seems like that isnt an option for whatever reason
mental hospital
<@!203444794737950720> one of my online friends is transitioning and her control freak father has beaten her and tried to choke her multiple times. she's gone to the police but they refuse to help her
she has nothing else she can do now. she is literally stuck with abusive parents who have beaten her multiple times and the police won't bother to help her
so yeah I've lost any little faith I had in the police that I had left
the police didn't listen to her, called her crazy, and hospitalized her
so an update on my friend:
holy shit
good point
anxiety-triggering is the 2020 meta to be popular i guess
ah
apparently someone on Twitter commented with a working link
tl;dr it basically makes transitioning illegal for minors and makes it legal for people like teachers to bully trans children
but they explain what it does simply in a thread
i guess they linked it wrong
I'm really fucking angry now
worst part is it's probably gonna be signed into law because IIRC kentucky is super conservative
oh man FUCK that disgusting bill
we're talking it over with my parents and therapist in two days
So my stress has skyrocketed thanks to a midterm I'm garunteed to fail, someone hacking into and deleting my social media accounts, my parents signing me up for things that I don't care about to take away my free time, already added onto my general anxiety and paranoia, among some other things. Today I thought about suicide. Even if I don't kill myself I feel like I might die of all the stress.
I'll retype it anyways. idk what happened to it
did a mod delete my message?
another thing that stresses me is that i can't be a real composer because I don't have any ear for pitch
I'm to tired to go into it but my parents hate it when I'm thinking for myself basically
they do that a lot
I think maybe I'm averse to it because I feel like my parents are gonna use it to dig into my free time even more
I don't have time for anything
I don't have time anyways
but I really do not want to meditate and I can't explain why
my mom suggested meditation
yuck
nothing works
but I don't know what to do about it
I feel like I have some disorder that causes me permanent paranoia even when I have absolutely no reason to be paranoid
they don't have a specific study their talking about so I assume they heard Through word of mouth
is this true and what are they deriving this from?
was talking in another server and according to them puberty blockers are bad for teenagers
I can't do that
yeah intervals
https://old.reddit.com/r/Drama/comments/djdmd9/we_banned_all_of_rteenagers_and_it_turns_out/
ive got 4 days or I'll probably have to fail Music Theory
I can't do it
I don't have either
ok but it's like at least half of my Music Theory midterms
today i will discuss my parent's rules with my parents and my therapist. wish me luck
please tell me it's like 6 hours a day
because that counts as addiction
don't do anything you enjoy
hey idea
*my parents have entered the chat* although that joke might not be applicable anymore idk!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ok the meeting just finished and fortunately enough it seems like my parents have genuinely listened to me and thought about how I felt and we've worked on a compromise for a new system that I feel would work better, and at the very least, they've agreed to extend my bedtime by 45 minutes so that's great. It seems like finally we're moving towards a system that really truly works.
yeah
also hi saki! don't see you often much anymore
it's a little bit confusing
also. I'd like to figure out for myself which candidate I want to root for with some research. The problem is I have no idea how to do said research.
lately stuff in the media saying "we have too many problems that we'll never solve so we don't have to do anything to solve them" annoy the shit out of me

it sucks
I am in a gifted program
<:staredog:667878479974498330>
yeahhhhh
as much as I detest lolicon artwork and that shit grosses me out, I also detest censorship and that shit grosses me out. So I've reached a moral dilemma.
I'm honestly confused about my opinion about it but I guess I'd end up agreeing with it for the most part, but I'm still not entirely certain
ok that video.....
it has good emotes and good art and a few cool regulars/mods
1- mods tolerate constant spam but no serious discussion
2- half the regulars have the blandest uwu weeb personalities
3- one of the mods is an abrasive cunt and abuses his power all the time, to this day I have no idea why he's been kept as a mod for so long
I'm glad it's not my server because there's many things wrong with it
no
so assumedly under 18
The Gen z role in the server is for locking people from NSFW channels
There's a gen z person in another server who everyone is calling a pedo because he thinks megumin is cute (from how he talks about it it seems like in a non sexual way). Are the people calling him a pedo justified?
basically
nvm its just ok
wait it segways into a sponsorship
love that joke at the end of the linus vid
that too
well, for most of history LGBT people have been told to be shameful for who we are and the pride movement is essentially us saying that we are proud to accept who we are. (from my perspective at least)
go ahead
the people on the student council who don't want a lgbt pride club because they "want people to be treated equally" have a lack of fundamental understanding of what pride is and are probably chuds
anyways to tie that tangent into what Voy was saying, most of my small circle of friends here have realized and accept me, but I never actually outright stated that I was bi because I'm not sure how people would react.
what I mean by that is that although most of the students there don't seem to conciously hate gay people, they make "no homo" jokes and get upset over being called "gay" for whatever reason. it's more a product of the environment these students grow up in rather than actual hatred, I would know because actually I too used to be passively homophobic when I was younger. In fact when I first started to realize I was bi I tried to tell myself I wasn't.
My school has a climate of what I call passive homophobia
yeah
just reading that tweet this guy sounds like an actual Twitter troll
<:staredog:667878479974498330> <:staredog:667878479974498330> <:staredog:667878479974498330>
probably sarcasm but this really wasn't the time
I guess I'm more stressed because the person who sent it to me sent it with text saying "why don't we nuke China?"
THE STRESS IS ONLY FUCKING PILING UP
https://apnews.com/05aa58325be0a85d44c637bd891e668f
I can't do this.
(when I say tech week, I mean, I have to stay 6 hours after school, so basically I get up, go to school, go home, and then sleep, no time for anything else)
tech week+sick+PC broke+work I missed while sick has me feeling more stressed than I can handle
(message sent twice due to bad connection but yeah that's also disgusting)
that's disgusting
that's disgusting
another server I'm in, the r/music server, has both a venting channel and a serious discussion channel for stuff like important news and events.
yeah. should explain what I said better, I'm not trying to attack people but hearing this stuff is really bad for my anxiety so I should probably avoid here.
it's like any topic can bring it into "hear ye hear ye we're all gonna die"
this is why I should just mute this channel
today I decided to start a fight in the Valk server and it's made me realize why I don't talk to people in real life
thought I should post it here
https://twitter.com/WhatTheTrans/status/1227021563712675840?s=20
I'm in theater tech and I haven't seen this yet but
I talk to a couple friends at lunch sometimes
honestly discord is most of my real social interaction at this point
yeah there's some people I'd like to get to know but I can never talk to them. I've just got a mental block that stops me from talking to everyone but very specific people
I used to be really social but it's like it's just been sapped away somehow
^ me
<:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
like, in theater tech people eat together in a circle but I just get my food and hide some rooms away
even being around people IRL is tough
idk why but talking to people IRL is really hard

I'm sure he was like "it's ironic bro"
yeah that's awful
oh shit
I'm not really up to speed with the whole "PewDiePie Nazi" thing, I've heard many differing opinions. All I know is he called someone in pubg the n word in a clearly derogatory way so I wouldn't doubt it.
that's true. he's still giving Ben promotion
which is hopefully the case
or is he just doing this for a meme
so voiceoverpete is probably a chud?
I was already thinking about it anyways
it didn't mess it up any further, it's just a solution that doesn't work  <@263534352422404096>
it was don't worry
I feel like I just don't like other people anymore
given my PCs fucked I might just leave Discord honestly
honestly I feel like shit because I can't talk to people IRL because I can't start discussions without either starting fights or sounding artificial
it's a really bad habit of mine
<@263534352422404096> other Symphogear server. don't go there, people there can be kind of toxic sometimes and it's less active than here
I could do that with so many servers but
the person arguing against me brought up pretty good points though
I'll say something is garbage to find out why someone likes it or vice versa
it's a really bad habit of mine
or, opinions
I force information out of others by starting fights with them
ok I gotta get over this
I get anxious over handing over a box with all my personal files and passwords to a stranger
it's not that I think they won't fix it
I'm not taking it in though. I don't trust other people with my PC
but Windows won't let me reset it.
I know why. The kernel or something is corrupted.
nope
the idea of other people looking in my computer just makes me feel even worse. idk why.
?
I'm not doing that
it's pathetic but I've really got nothing else
If my computer is broken I've basically lost all the things that made life not so bad and now life is only stress and no happiness at all
I'm having those thoughts again because my computer is broken
I actually find that when I think immediately I overthink and self reflecting leads me to straighten things out logically
I'm not sure. However long it needs to be.
Alright:
I've made the concious desicion to take a break from discord servers. It's become addictive and it's taking away time that I can spend thinking to myself and self reflecting and is probably helping alienate me from other people real life. 
I specify servers because I will continue to DM people and my DMs are open.
no
no
and when I do talk I regret what I said for the rest of my life
but it feels like I'm not supposed to talk unless I've been asked a question or something
I'm kind of upset because I can't talk to anyone in theater tech.
I miss him already
but I shouldn't need to rely on them to enjoy life. if I do somethings wrong.
most of the things I enjoy day to day are on the computer
no it's the right desicion. I rely in my computer too much
I might as well stop using computers honestly. it's probably better for me.
mine is still fucked and it wasn't giving the repair guy any problems apparently when he had it but when I start using it it starts crashing
gonna come back to vent for a second but I'm done with computers
I think he won in NH polls?
(also sorry for coming back I'm just having a rough day)
that I later recognize is awful and I shouldn't be thinking
hating who you are? I can't really put it into words well but as an example sometimes I just think extremely ableist shit
not just self hating thoughts but
you ever have like
every day I am pushed closer and closer to being anarchist
I'm not too educated on this topic
American democracy isn't really democracy from what I've heard
see you when you're ready!
‚ù§Ô∏è
I've heard porn (aggressive video porn at least, which isn't something I'm into) can lead to expectations so high it can cause dysfunction
like  (I'm just gonna put the next part in spoilers because it's embarrassing to talk about)
||like the idiot adolescent I am, I've been moderately consuming porn (not videos, just softcore images and occasionally softcore gifs) and I've heard people saying it fucks up your brain when you're an adolescent and it's making me anxious. I wouldn't say I'm addicted because it doesn't interfere with other stuff in my life. I probably shouldn't even really be discussing it here but thinking about talking to anyone IRL about it, even my therapist, just feels even worse somehow||
basically
can I talk about something kind of uncomfortable?
I think I'll be semi active in this one server and my own server because people here are generally helpful and no one else would want to mod my server
I joined the Valk server around the time AXZ ended.
I think I started watching Symphogear a little more than a year before joining
I think that was around the time I started steering away from those Gamer SJW cringe communities so it was the perfect time to join this server. Honestly being here has educated me a lot on stuff like LGBT issues.
I think I joined in like May or June of 2018.
talking about when we joined huh?
I'm out at lunch rn but I'll watch it when I get home
hey why are all cops supposedly bad?
thanks.
<@84811738653929472> my parents are I guess what you would call neoliberals? their viewpoints are a mixed bag. They're accepting of LGBT+ rights but they still have some faith in capitalism.
i really should not have brought it up. fuck
I got a weird short burst of euphoria from leaving
there are a few nice people there but I can only think of one of them that isn't already a regular here too
but yeah  <@84811738653929472> over there they call this server a Nazi server. that should tell you something about them.
yeah I did
honestly I'm not even sure Rahki. for my own health I should probably leave
||another Symphogear server. most of the regulars are kinda toxic dickheads||
||(surprise surprise it was Valk)||
this was mostly spurred by some guy in another server calling for a "state of sanity"
I fucking hate how everyone has no problem with labeling anyone they don't like as having a mental illness and being totally facist against mental illness. The worst part is I'm definitely guilty of it sometimes too but I want to stop thinking that way.
thanks for letting me know
yeah that's pretty bad
ohhhhhh
other than platform someone who is enbyphobic which ||imo from the way it's been told to me that wasn't intentional and she apologized so is it really that bad in the long run?||
what did contra points do again
I'm going to go do something else with my time. This discussion is bonkers.
... what
great now we're getting into religion
which isn't "no government", it's "no meaningless hierarchies"
what about anarchism
I mean
this is some weird ass logic right here rn
feel like this is relevant
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=piTAJEjfRC4
idk
yeah but that looks cringey {talking back}
what's wrong with that {curious}
also, from now on when I send a message I'll make things easier for everyone by inserting my emotion at the end {Serious but smiling lightly}
so I've decided to just lock up my server and make the 10 most active regulars part of a group chat
he's not a bad person. in fact he's super nice back when I knew him IRL but the internet gives us this smoke of this lack of emotion and empathy
we both have major temper issues and we express it in different ways and we have trouble with empathy.
to tell you the truth
I got back into contact with the guy that ruined a ton of online stuff a while back (you may remember).
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MSvWz6t3tfs&feature=emb_title
political views test

and leaving anti semetic comments
from what I've been seeing it looks like neo Nazis are dislike-bombing this trailer
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1dTJs6AnTgQ&feature=emb_title
9axes
<@279341087494242304> both are shows with pedo and incest themes
but it does have some gross themes
I'll say that
SAO and Goblin Slayer are more just edgy and bad
honestly I can see NGNL as also a gross show for gross people
but I don't think it's a form of child exploition lol
honestly if we're just taking "eromanga sensei gross" I agree, it's a gross show for gross people
That's why the owner recognition part should be better than it is currently
idk
and maybe some sort of GPS or something with specific areas like public spaces where guns can't be used
I guess I agree with that. But like, I'd rather guns have some sort of mechanism that allows it to only be used by the person who buys it, (something like fingerprint recognition but more foolproof)
I've noticed lots of pro gun people like to bring up very specific scenarios where a gun would be helpful to justify their point
got into an argument with a pro-gun person today
https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2020/02/25/third-of-poland-lgbt-free-zone-atlas-of-hate-homophobia/
hmmmm
I'm sorry I lashed out like that. this topic gets me riled up.
that makes sense.
I'm really fucking angry because it seems like people don't want to address issues with guns because they're so ingrained in American culture and just say "shit happens"
^
so we just throw our hands up in defeat and just legalize murder then?
<:Biknife:640008865106231296>
anyone else in support of parenting lisences?
when I hear "gay joke" I just assume it's ignorance
oh ok then never mind
where does he live?
maybe you need to have a talk with them about it
<@486087033652248576> ‚ù§Ô∏è
I mean, lots of people enjoy things that aren't computer-related
I mean honestly the real reason I want to stop using my computer is because when it doesn't work I feel awful
you think Bloomberg's gonna drop out soon?
oh
what about parenting classes in high school?
that seems like a good idea as long as they aren't in the government's hand and could be given to everyone who wants them somehow.
that's why I brought it up, yeah
jokes aside bad take on my part, sorry
but you do get that with multiplication <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah I guess realistically the system wouldn't work
saki good point
there's lots of people who just shouldn't be parents for many reasons
makes sense
ah
Tories?
yeah. why do you need to be in Poland? is there like some awful law that non-EU Britain is gonna put into effect?
I'm not keeping up with Brexit
why do you need to be in Poland?
what happens when no deal happens?
does she like it there?
(at least)
<@284390402210136064> gotta love one third of Poland being anti-LGBTQ+ üôÉ
the worst time to stay up late
but it's flu season
if you see me on Discord or anywhere past about 9:15 EST, please yell at me
ever since my computer has been fucked I've had this terrible coping method of staying up really late on my phone.
my brain honestly makes up shit to scare me
it's literally just dogelore but with edgy memes that:
-is racist, sexist, anti semetic, homophobic, aaand transphobic
-literally promote mass shootings!!!!!
r/DogeEthnostate
one of my friends found the worst subreddit
honestly sex ed in the U.S. is terrible
it's freaking me out
and yes
I'm not sure honestly it's just ||I learned recently that apparently the way most people masturbate is completely different from the way I've done it for my whole life, and when I try to do it the normal way I get nothing||
I asked my parents before but they didn't take me seriously
realized today that I'm probably impotent! fun
ok just left all my major servers. I'll be only using DMs now. I'm gonna stay in this one for emotes but if <@99695384296701952> could give me a role that makes it so I can't send or read messages that would be great.
(and YouTube and Reddit too)
I think my idea of just stopping using Discord servers that I had before was really good, it's just that I didn't really follow through

I'm an unbelievable coward (I WAS FUCKING SCARED OF TORTILLA CHIPS EARLIER TODAY), I can't talk to people, and I rely on one thing to keep me happy and don't know of anything else that makes me happy
I hate myself sooo much right now. I can't see anything positive about myself right now.
why was I told this was something new
wait what the fuck
margeret thatcher is dead
I don't know much about it but its been disproven a lot as far as I know
and giving them
there's like a misinformation that gay people have a super high chance of getting STDs
<@472513526393602059> the STD thing was sarcasm
<@87512939107450880> "muh STDs"
update: essentially what happened was the police had a high risk firearm search warrant, went into a house, and then shot and killed the person living there
It's likely that the shooter was apprehended but since I don't know for sure it's freaking me out
I can't tell if I'm overreacting or not
ok I think I'm overreacting
I'm scared
police are being very fucking vague too
holy shit
there was a police shootout just a couple blocks away from where I live
I live in a pretty nice neighborhood so it's really weird
I don't know anything else about the situation
well, potent is the wrong word. more like, it won't be in circulation as much
I think it's gonna be less potent by summertime because some people will have antibodies against it
about the article itself
You can't bargain with it
either we let injustice happen, or destroy the system causing the injustice.
I've realized there's no in between
the way I see it
it all seems hopeless
like, actually good ideas exist, but there's no way to implement them
sometimes I feel like we're regressing
but I just hate what America stands for so much and there's no way to fix it
yeah nukes further complicate things
me too but America is beyond saving
which unfortunately won't happen and probably wouldn't even work
I feel like us non-nationalist Americans should leave the country and wait for like 10 other countries to work together and invade and destroy America
I hate America so much

well I scanned the link and VirusTotal doesn't pick it up, but just to be on the safe side I'd just use the original site
it's the wrong link
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=bEEaqoSiIPw
<@263534352422404096> the url for that map is actually malware as it would seem
I don't really know, but He's trying.
I don't know. I guess He created us, and His goal is for He and humanity to truly understand and love each other. That's all I can think of.
I finally just stopped crying. I feel like I was crying for fifteen minutes at least. I wasn't even sad. I don't know what emotion I'm feeling.
so basically: God and humanity don't really understand each other, but they desperately want to understand and love each other. Ultimately God just wants the best for us, but he doesn't always really know what's best. The same thing with humans for themselves. 
The specific example that came into my mind was one I was thinking of for a really long time, being homosexuality. God was never truly against homosexuality, it's just that when it first started occuring, he didn't really understand it and thought it was something bad. As time has gone on he's understood that it's simply a natural thing and there's nothing wrong with it.
God isn't all-knowing or wise like many think he is. He doesn't really have this big massive plan for us. He just wants to understand us and love us.
I know I'm just a lowly human and I can't really speak for God but I guess that's what it means for me.
I don't want to force my beliefs on anyone. These are simply my beliefs.
I was in my kitchen washing dishes
and I thought to myself something along the lines of "well I don't believe in God but if he exists and could tell me kindly that he's there, that would be great"
then I went to my room. I was about to go to bed
and this idea popped up in my head and before I could even really understand it, I started crying
it took me several minutes to realize what the thought was about and even then I'm still struggling to properly put it into words, but I'll try my best.
<@203444794737950720> yeah, but if we take good precautions and people stay home, the people with the virus will eventually recover and less other people will get it
I'm pretty positive it  won't be passed though (unlike some extreme leftists I've talked to who think it's time to start shooting up cops)
VPNs would probably be made illegal
I'm sure this is unconstitutional in some way
https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2020/03/earn-it-bill-governments-not-so-secret-plan-scan-every-message-online
you get to pick between center-right and right
you don't
because their military is too massive
anyways, the problem is that you can't overthrow the U.S.
yeah
It's *probably* not gonna pass, and the chance is even lower if lots of people protest and contact their senators
The article wasn't written by extremists
I think it's worth talking about. I think people should contact their congressmen and senators.
just the idea of it happening terrifys me
it would turn the U.S. into more of a dystopia than it already is
and i would literally have to fucking filter myself for private conversations
if this happens I will have to delete my discord account
but like
i guess its been gradual since ive heard of it
i know its so obviously a bad idea and only the most out-of-touch people would actually vote for it, but I've been told for a while that Congress is pretty out of touch
if it passes
the bill thats gonna make it so that the government scans all messages and communitcations
im suddenly really scared of EARN IT
i promise when this is all over I'm gonna develop actual social skills
‚ù§Ô∏è
because this social distancing is gonna be around for a while
im feeling a little bad
is Sweden a nice place to live?
ive gotta fight i guess
if change doesnt come without violence than humanity is garbage
maybe optimism isn't what I thought it was
I don't wanna be a doomer, I want to be optimistic
which makes me feel hopeless
when faced with an option for solving a problem, people will think it's smarter to pick the violent solution over the peaceful one
idk I'm just seeing a pattern
but I can't actually prove in any way it wasn't just my parents
I remember my parents telling me it was from a doctor
I don't remember a doctor telling me this actually
I only have gluten and milk a couple of times a week during school weeks anyways, so maybe if I just stay aware of it...
but for now I'll just not have any
and I ended up not getting any
but then they also gave the substitute to other kids who could eat the regular cupcakes
I couldn't have any so they brought in a substitute
one time in 5th grade there was a class party with cupcakes
so
wanna hear a story
no
and they always say they'll do it soon but never do
it's mostly because over the years I've asked my parents to test me again
but then I have to eat mediocre food instead of good food
yes
so I should explain a little: I'm not supposed to eat gluten or milk products because it apparently makes me really angry
and for the past few years I've been eating it behind my parent's backs because I didn't notice any effect
and because school has been out, I've not had any gluten or milk food for a while, but yesterday I had some at a friend's house
so I'm thinking that might actually be behind my anxiety, given my anxiety has been mostly prevelant in the last year or two, which is when I started to add gluten and milk back into my diet.
so I'm gonna experiment for a week not having any and see how I feel
ok I've realized something
why does policymaking have to be like this
but no amount of rational thinking will stop random anxiety
im sure companies like facebook and google are probably gonna lobby hard against EARN IT
im aware of that
to them the only people who use vpns are criminals
they dont know that though
so they need a backdoor too
but the vpns use encrytion
they'll just think "oh them kids and their video gamers, theyll have to put up with it"
theyre so out of touch
but they dont know that
I guess stuff I don't expect that makes it difficult or impossible for me to enjoy myself
eh mostly anything that could fuck up my way of life
I can never tell I'm anxious until it's too late
I understand that it's not logical to think like this but I cannot stop myself with any amount of logic
it feels like my brain's melting sometimes
I take everything way too seriously
it's like I can feel my lifespan shorten
I hear so much each day
like, before adulthood
idk more and more each day I feel like my life's gonna end soon
I think this boogaloo thing proves for me that gluten and dairy isn't the problem as I've not had it in several days
kill zone?
?
ok Im reading more sources and I'm confused about if the boog targets everybody or just government workers
I'm moving to Canada as soon as I'm old enough. I can't deal with insane gun nuts.
favela?
after reading about the boogaloo I'm a little confused about if I'm pro gun or not but I think for now I'm not
from what I'm reading it sounds less like overthrowing a tyrannical government and more like "if you touch gun laws we will start mass shootings everywhere"
it sounds fucking crazy
now I'm against it
read a bit more on the boogaloo
and I dont have one
yeah
So, I guess I'm in support when the time comes.
And I don't think we're very close yet either.
I support a revolution when it's necessary. I don't think we've reached that point yet.
?
boog?
i think ive finally been convinced to become pro gun
im not saying violent revolution is wrong, im saying the example he gives isnt a good one
yeah thats what i thought
he said specifically the united states
it's got many huge issues but I'm not convinced it's reached that point just yet
yes, but is this really currently tyranny?
but is it worth violence?
i cant tell if its logical or extremism
not sure what i think of this

this makes me feel a little better, hopefully it will be taken seriously
https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-opposition-s-3398-earn-it-act
also lots of old folks in Italy
they're generally helpful but we haven't figured out a permanent solution yet
yeah I talk to them once a week
idk I have this terrible habit of catastrophizing
no
it doesn't really make me anxious
that's a minor thing
isnt poland the country that has a dedicated "anti-LGBT" third of the country?
<@!203444794737950720> waht country
he is awful at public speaking lmao
dr phil made a video on this wtf
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YfQripU0vYo
just dont panic and fearmonger
like, don't not take precautions
i mean yeah
i mean, its still unlikely
https://twitter.com/birdexecutive/status/1242517074905268225?s=21
and as solo said earlier the VPN companies would lobby against it
yeah I just thought of that. it's making me feel better now
it freaks me out
if it gets passed people who talk about piracy and drugs and stuff are garunteed to get arrested
it's just like
I wouldn't know what to say anyways
I want to do that but I keep forgetting to
if it passes I might get arrested because I've talked about the "high seas", so to speak, here and I have this fear deep down that if it gets passed that will be heavily targeted
i got worried about the earn it act again
trying to turn this pandemic into an opportunity to shill their garbage beliefs
fuck those people
true
I'm gonna have summer stolen from me
they're saying it might extend into the summertime and into the fall
fuck
aight
and gender dysphoria is like, the ice cream will literally make you vomit
i knew there was a word for that
THANK YOU
and the problem is, I know its a bad take but I don't really have any evidence that I can use to disprove it
tl;dw he basically says "people without gender dysphoria aren't really trans and are trivializing gender dysphoria"
he makes a pretty bad take around 6:13
this video isnt all bad, there are some genuine criticisms here, but
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gdK5okZfrD0&t
my mom has been surprisingly normal this whole time
to be perfectly clear: there was no actual gore. it was *framed* like a gore video but when I actually watched it, they suddenly stopped before the beheading and started dancing
I don't think it was a great prank but I don't think I'd ban this person or leave this server where I have tons of friends just cause he made a kinda meh prank
I got pranked
theyd get banned fast if it was actual gore, but it wasn't
well, then I would report him to the other mods
like, i felt like a complete idiot afterwards
it wasn't that bad imo
meh honestly like
like, it was called gore.mp4, the thumbnail is what you would expect the beginning of s beheading to look like, and the guy said "btw here's a beheading vid". there was no way to figure out that it was a meme.
he framed it as a beheading though
I'm an idiot
apparently they drop the machete and start dancing
so, I didn't actually watch to the end of the video
oh
yeah he's a mod
I fucking hope he gets punished
i don't feel like screenshoting it, I don't want to have it anywhere near me
I already know that someones gonna get really offended and honestly they're probably justified so like
actually I'm just gonna not tbh
from now on if you see me talk about personal problems anywhere please tell me to shut the fuck up and get over it
I'm sorry. it just freaked me out at first before I actually knew it was a joke
that server ain't a shitty crowd
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
they're more like this server
they aren't 4chan types who throw racial slurs around
like this is way out of character for them
an edgy community
this isn't really like
I'm not really defending them, I just don't think they're a psycho and I don't think I need to leave the server or have them kicked
but it's really just a bad edge joke. it's not really anything serious
I think it's a bad joke, and I'm not personally friends with that person
its ok. i shouldn't bother any of you with it
<@676272618839605249> I mean, it's just an idea. Putting it into practice would be rather difficult
 <@227652825876922378> yeah that's a problem
and there was like a button in every room that could also alert the police station in an emergency
what if police stations and schools were build directly next to one another
I had an idea on how to lessen the impact/amount of school shootings so I wanted to run it by yall
yup
which is very obviously not true if you do research
I think its mostly informed by this myth that trans kids are forced to immediatly start medically transitioning
its interesting because, what's the negative here? I don't really see the problem with it. It's just people experimenting and finding what works and doesn't.
"This is just a trend, most trans kids now will go back to their AGAB in a few years"
I've noticed an interesting transphobe argument
put it here because its politics-related
rrly good video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yts2F44RqFw
would be nice to have a political system that isnt black and white
i certainly wish it wasn't like that though
i kinda feel like voting green is the same as not voting personally, in this scenario
anyways, I wouldn't be bernie or bust if I could vote. I'd begrudgingly vote Biden purely because of the alternative
(not gramatically correct)
no progress or take away progress
choose your fighter
rapist who's gonna sit there and act like its not his problem while licking people's ears
rapist who's gonna yell at people and make the problem ten times worse especially for minorities
i was more so talking about the community itself and the parasocial relationships but yeah the platform is pretty bad too
youtube as a whole fucking sucks
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
`youtube`
`youtube streamers`
<@!472513526393602059> thats not how it works though
exactly
like, aren't people just gonna be dying to go out and meet up with people once this is over? they already can't stop themselves from doing it even when they shouldn't.
which is like so stupid to me
there are articles about the covid 19 outbreak saying afterwards people aren't gonna want to go outside anymore and everyone's gonna be more introverted and social relationships are gonna die
realistically
personally I think the best measure for making school shootings happen less is probably gun control but like, that's not gonna work out unfortunately
but reading things is just that
I'm just feeling awful because all I do is pick up opinions from other people. I don't develop my own
I don't want to have any opinions now
its probably because my parents basically drilled into me that my worth in life is following the instructions of others
i have a feeling that my opinions are too easily influenced by others
I dont encourage it and I don't want it to happen but it could happen
I don't know when but that's the path we're headed down as a nation I guess
I feel like a group's gonna emerge soon and they'll be ready to be violent
we're at the point where there's concentration camps
never mind ignore me
I feel like the chance is still very low but its creeping a little higher each day
and I'm either gonna be drafted or forced to join some far left resisitance that spirals into civil war
i kinda have this lingering fear that as soon as I become an adult all shits gonna break loose
people who don't know shit are fine with it
i want to think for myself more
so i have this friend and he calls me on discord a lot and he calls me so much that sometimes I just don't want to talk to him, and today he called me like twice and I couldnt pick up for external reasons so the third time I picked up. I started talking to him and immediately just realized I didn't want to talk to him and basically pulled a "oh wait my mom's calling me bye" and left and now I'm feeling bad about it
how do i figure out my political ideology
picking up opinions from others
does your brain ever just blast memories of things from long long ago that you regret?
it's not that I feel less attracted to girls, it's that I don't express my attraction because I feel like that's wrong of me
I mean I gush over guys a lot, but it feels different with girls and I can't explain why.
I feel attracted to both boys and girls but gushing over girls feels wrong to me
you ever realize you're really sexist?
my friend just pointed out to me that I gush over cute boys all the time but hardly ever cute girls. it's not that I don't feel attracted to girls but now I've noticed that I subconsciously feel uncomfortable expressing it.
we elect such smart and knowledgeable people to govern us
Jesus Christ I'd have gone to a different school for every year of high school
you're right
11th
yeah, but its still big...
I don't think it's completely out of our budget but it would be a big investment
but then I realized my parents would have to spend a lot of money and now I'm not sure if I want to go
so they want to move me to a different school next year, there's a private school we both think would be really good.
yeah so my parents have agreed this whole time that my school has been crap
second, he says the left ruined literature, but then talks about how one university removed a painting of Shakespeare to replace it with a painting of a black lesbian writer. That's all he says. It's barely tangentially related.
first of all "the left ruin art"
he essentially says that before the left, art was supposed to be beautiful and pleasant, but apparently the left made art shocking and avante-garde. I don't even think I need to explain the several reasons this point is terrible, but the reason I bring this point up is that good ol Dennis listed Jay-Z among a ton of avante-garde and weird art which I find hilarious and the most boomer thing ever
all the points made in the video are terrible for a myriad of reasons but there's two I want to focus on
they have a video called "the left ruin everything"
like
<@266379640069685252> PragerU is one of the dumbest channels on YouTube
and that just makes me set bad expectations for myself
but that's not a good way to live
I'm always just thinking about later and never now
Im just not very in-the-moment
I'm passionate about music
but I don't really do that
but I can't make my own point B
when I don't know point B I give up
no
because music is about trying new things and experimenting and I just go from point A to point B
but that's not right for me
I thought I could have a career related to some form of art but I'm not cut out for that
now I just feel bad because I don't know what to do with my life
All my life my parents have constantly made me feel like I'm a really creative person and because of this it's only now that I'm realizing I'm not very creative at all tbh.
~~good for them, I wouldn't associate myself with gamers either~~
I feel like
if Discord wasn't marketed towards gamers more schools would use it
I don't know how to master it
I'm having trouble enjoying things in the moment. I'm always thinking about how much time I'm gonna spend doing things and about what I'm gonna do later
i dont see transmen as much as transwomen online
but yeah, I agree with Kat
some of which are trans
and therefor interact with a lot of people who like anime
actually, it's probably because I like anime
like, I don't think it means that trans women are just men who have a fetish but I do wonder what the correlation means
a transphobe just pointed out to me that most trans people are transwomen who love anime and now I can't unsee it.
to be clear I'm not transphobic myself but I find this intriguing.
I was gonna research this and try to debunk it, but all the papers I've found so far point to it being accurate
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/624357800289501224/700347782044581888/yezomodv31t41.png
is it bad if suburban white kids saying "coronavirus take me already, I want to die" really ticks me off for some reason?
RIP
its gonna take forever to finish one game
but then you progress really slowly
given the length of a game
4 hours a day playing games
you have to spend like
but with gaming for example
maybe traditionalists have a point tbh
but those things give you a dopamine rush so doing them at all will eventually lead to addiction, i feel
so that an addiction can't develop
i feel like it's safer just to not
here's 2
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3050060/
https://search.proquest.com/openview/0737f331bb830d9e907a0cd107ef40b5/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&cbl=18750&diss=y
and it actually turned out to be accurate
looked at some scientific papers
thought "haha this is shit, let me debunk it"
I saw the image
so
what i saw
no
yeah! I'm not allowed to educate myself or do research!
how does it violate rules
why???
yeah
you can be imaginative
I mean
as long as it's without porn
from what i've seen masturbation is normal in moderation
porn specifically
ok, you can try to prove to me that this is incorrect
but nothing works
i dont know how to stop though
I can't get rid of them though
but I don't know if I was really having fun with it
maybe I just don't like video games
i already know i dont like rhythm games
but i dont know what I like in games
pretty textures, improvisation, and interesting rhythms
i know what I like in music
what do i even enjoy in games anyways?
i dont know what to do
ok I think 14 hours a week for me is probably my best bet
schedules dont help me that much
i think i really just need to find a way to get over it but i dont know how
but often they interest me in some way too
the obvious solution would be to stop going online at all but I've tried that and it creates entirely new problems
and it makes me feel bad when i progress through them slowly
everyone online frames their favorite things as things you have to do before you die
i think it's the fear of not getting to everything
idk i think I have a problem that I obsess too much over having completed a lot of things rather than actually enjoying them
I don't have an attention span like that
some stuff is *comforting* but I'm never truly *happy*
months and months. I can't remember what it feels like
to tell you the truth, I haven't experienced joy or euphoria in a very long time and thats why I assume my dopamine receptors are messed up somehow
no
but I could be wrong about that
like, it's already destroyed my dopamine receptors at this point so theres no reason to stop anymore
honestly like, I don't know if getting off discord was the best idea.
anyways, bye
im on board with anything that might work
what else can I do?
alright I'm gonna do something about my discord addiction
bye everyone
it was a short one, and i used a guide a lot
this is a normal thing that happens?
my therapist doesn't help either
I don't understand how though
i dont know what I'm supposed to be learning
i didnt learn anything
what makes more sense though?
what else could it be though?
they pretty much told me "maybe you'll feel better tomorrow"
I did but she wasn't able to offer any helpful advice
I hope schools reopen by September
well, I've still got two years of high school yet and I don't want to be lonely and isolated like this entire year
<@456226577798135808> my social skills are already terrible and I'm worried if we start the next year with online classing I'm gonna be completely unable to make friends
Maybe when the curve finally flattens some things like schools will reopen
They might like, have to reopen schools by fall if things have improved a lot
I keep thinking that there's no way it's actually going to be a year and a half, it can't be that bad
I keep thinking that there's no way it's actually going to be a year and a half, it can't be that bad
I'll only have one year of school though
but I'll be in a new school by then anyways
but I was already behind socially, missing a whole year is gonna turn me into a complete social outcast
oh well, at least I have other things to keep me busy
sucks that I might miss my entire junior year based on what the experts are saying
I want to be less negative
you aren't physically near people online. you can't actually do anything with them, all you can do is talk.
RL friendships mean so much more than online ones
there is one best way to do everything
but time is linear
I'm convinced I was happy before then and this is why I'm not happy now
I've had pretty much only online friends for like 2 thirds of a year and I'm not happy
but they aren't
but it's not the same
so I can actually meet with them
well, they need to be IRL friends
but even then, I need good friends to be truly happy
....that is when they went to high school, to be fair
well, sucks that I'll never really make friends in high school at all now
my parents told me that I'm supposed to make all my lifelong friends in high school
god help me I just want to enjoy my life
i never had a childhood and now i wont have good memories of being a teenager
I can't I can't
I'm not gonna not have friends for two whole fucking years
I'm not losing my junior year
fuck
aka i think for myself and not in black and white
no, I want to be a true centrist
I don't want to be associated with them
no I'm just talking about the left as a whole
not really
fuck the circlejerk left and the bigoted right
yeah I've become a centrist now
maybe Siege
maybe I should take up a multiplayer game with a group of friends!
but I don't have anything to do while voice chatting
idk. maybe I would be happy if I voice chatted more often
i dont VC like at all
and I don't play multiplayer games
voice chat is awkward
just forever text
online friends don't bring me the euphoria that I have a hunch a real friend could
no
but where else am I gonna make friends
I don't feel like I can really get to know someone at all online
like, the kinds of people who know everything about every tank ever and draw their waifus in military uniforms with guns
I don't know why but I just feel kinda yucky whenever I interact with people who are obsessed with war
its fine if you dont wanna boycott him, I'm just doing it personally
?
<@456226577798135808> yeah he's pretty much cardboard
I don't think he actually is affiliated with Higurashi
except without digibros personality
<@456226577798135808> pretty much a digibro clone
I think he's friends with the SMonroeShow who is a truscum iirc
<@284390402210136064> he does video essays
yeah I don't think I'll be watching his videos anymore
https://i.redd.it/s76orc304tt41.png
like, I had 3 different convos here today
i feel like i bring nothing but negativity to everyone I'm around
but if i disagree with one leftist thing now im the bad guy!!!
I dont really know why I hate the left. I agree with what they're saying, but hearing it over and over again makes me feel jaded in a way and i end up disagreeing
honestly i think I'm slowly going insane
oh
I'm mostly mad at the left because they seem to not want to bother explaining why their ideas will work and instead attack anyone who steps any toe out of line at all
?
i dont have fun without other people
I think I need to balance that out
A couple of weeks ago I realized that my opinions weren't well developed and as a result I think my opinions have been getting more aggressively negative and disagreeable
it's alright!
I'm a massive contrarian
I need to admit this about myself
honestly
what if I don't though?
i can sure laugh at all of them
they aren't that complicated though
but I know lots of people who base their entire personality over war history, guns, tanks, and the soviet union
I mean, apart from military strategy those things individually don't really mean much
terfs aren't real feminists. they don't fight for the rights of all women, only the ones they deem as worthy.
either is fine.
and paradoxically have trouble interacting with people
i am a people person
centrist man
i know
`cis het gay men`
but the general population doesn't know any better than "autistic people are stupid idiots and it would be bad to hire them"
I might be refused jobs
no, it'll bite *me* in the future
they think that's just what people with autism are like, usually
but they are, but the general person doesn't know that
Ultimately I know I can't stop all of these people from thinking like this, but I do want it to be the popular opinion that these types are jackasses
yeah, which is why I try my best to stay away from Reddit and stuff
the memes don't offend me so much that they make me feel bad about myself but I don't like that the culture cultivates these harmful views and generally try to voice my dissent to these things when I hear them.
is this a good or bad argument? I genuinely can't tell but I'm leaning towards bad

They didn't state what the changes are so I'm confused
confused about what this means
http://chng.it/ZRGrpxnMKw
his connection was being bad
oh
its been about an hour since he first heard the gunshots. we were talking for a while but then he suddenly stopped responding to/reading my messages. although, its 12 AM over there so he might have fallen asleep.
we're hoping to possibly move in with one another one day though, although i wouldn't count on it actually happening
his economic situation is not good
it seems like its over but I cannot be too sure
so I'm gonna stay up to make sure he's safe
My best online friend who I love dearly just heard gunshots right next to his house a little while ago (he lives in Venezuela)
but allowing them to be blocked from medical aid is on a whole new level of fucked
I mean he also blocked trans people from joining the military
religions should not be allowed to infringe on human rights
religious freedom is broken
how can he even make an excuse
but
obviously he cant actually justify this
like an excuse
I cannot see any way to justify this other than "i hate trans people"
how is he gonna justify this though?
***DOCTORS CAN NOW FUCKING REFUSE TO TREAT PEOPLE IF THEY ARE TRANS***
*breathes in*
https://planettransgender.com/trump-treatment-of-covid19-transgender-patients-is-optional/
typically when I know I can't win i just reccomend people to avoid the place
rather unfortunately
you can't change their minds
yeah if I'm on 4chan I'd just stay quiet tbh
I guess bottom of the line is I probably don't need to call people out if they're just being a shitty memer, but if I see genuinely ableist people I will call them out.
There's a difference between being prepared for something and accepting it.
I feel I didn't get the vibe they were saying "there are gonna be ableists out there and you have to be ready", I feel like they were saying "if you're on the internet you're just gonna have to accept ableism"
generally most people i see think autistic people are stupid idiots
on its own
idk it seems like kind of a lame argument to me
other than "i know one or two trans people who are straight"
because i dont have anything to argue against it with
i know its wrong but theres no way i can argue against it
since i dont know what really causes it it throws my morals into a loop even if im aware that its not true
generally the people on itsafetish think that dysphoria exists but it's caused by fetishization of being lesbian
i dont know what causes it
yeah but when my morals are challenged by what seems [even if it isnt] to be reasoning and facts it becomes a problem
what was the idea?
honestly i think I need to figure out how to stop my opinions from bending so fucking easily
i just found r/itsafetish by accident and for a second it was fucking me up because what they were saying initially made sense and then the rational part of my brain was like "you're a fucking idiot, they're cherrypicking hard" and I went back to thinking that they are dumbasses. but yeah that got me thinking I don't have any hard evidence and studies backing up gender dysphoria and stuff like that so if anyone has any I would be appreciative
how do you know its fake?
as someone who believes in god, i agree with that statement
down with class
if i do one option I won't have the other later
idk. anything you do can result in irreversible damage later on down the line. you never know.
well then if you don't you're screwed
if I don't I'm a waste
by now I need to be able to figure out what I want to do with the rest of my life like everyone else
i'm a waste of a human being so it would be better to just be someone's tool
but when I make desicions myself they're always bad
I've tried to develop a moral system for decision making and it always works out bad.
ok
not necessarily. I can find a partner and just do all of their cooking and cleaning and etc for them.
i think my brain just leaps over logic to agree with whatever i am hearing unless i already want to disagree
the problem is that i dont have any objective data i can use to back it up
i understand that
If I remove stuff in my day like music and fun stuff then I can be more productive
ok im gonna go work
i used to think that was full of shit but now I'm starting to think I'm the one who's full of shit
my dad tells me a lot that "when you're a kid playing video games and stuff is fun but growing up is about learning to find joy in serving others"
I'm not just supposed to exist for myself
that's bad
but just doing what i want would be selfish hedonism
<@!183785454447886346> but those people are trying to fuck it up. I just do exactly what they mean.
exactly
also they can't complain if i just did exactly what they told me to do
not necessarily
I would be most happy when no one is in disagreement with me
I think we kind of veered on a tangent a little, but point is: if I just do what's asked of me, I can avoid conflict and these things will happen less
of course
i'm just waiting for that one thing thats gonna fuck me up
yea
something that's ok one day can fuck you up the next
thats just an example
not necessarily
<@!203444794737950720> well then I'm totally fucked
what if I say fuck it and smoke weed and then some new data comes out that smoking any amount of weed causes hearing loss
and I make bad desicions a lot
I feel like bad desicions can permanently mess me up
these people have like 0 self awareness
someone on r/consumeproduct posted something about stalin hating gay people and someone commented with "wtf I love communism now"
<@!279341087494242304> thanks I'll see if they work
how can I stop myself from overthinking
but that results in me figuring out what video game I want to play
I want to play video games honestly right now
so what do I do?
i mean overthinking like, paranoia
I dunno. I can't be happy without overthinking everything so I might as well be productive
I don't fling insults at people who like Trout Mask Replica
like I can understand strongly disliking some piece of art but flinging insults at people who like it is just disingenuous
this whole discussion is dumb
it sounds awful
never seen goblin slayer but just watched through that video
Fundamentalists are people who think society should never change and every bad system should be forced on everyone
I just dislike fundamentalists very much.
basically these people brigaded a post I made
this is related to something from last night
it's either fucking apartheid or it isn't bigotry at all I guess
because there can't be different kinds of bigotry

SAME
whatever. it's over with now
gamingcirclekerk generally makes fun of "ewwww sjw" types
idk
but it's not like 5 people haven't already made a similar joke to mine, and a week-long ban for a slightly off topic post is fucking overboard
like here's the thing: I understand if I was the first person making this joke, I would be ok with getting a warning
reddit's fucked
Idk what i expected from reddit tbh
tl;dr: I post a meme making fun of a stupid fundamentalist subreddit that is similar to a lot of posts made on the subreddit before, it initially gets a lot of traction but then the fundamentalist subreddit finds out and gets their nipples in a jiffy and spam comment shit like "As a member of r/consumeproduct gay people don't scare me", which i sort of expected but out of the blue I get banned for seven days by a moderator because my post has nothing to do with gaming [when let's be real like a good third of the content on the subreddit has nothing to do with gaming itself]
anyways I guess i got nae nae'd
also a lot of people from r/consumeproduct seem to be doing the same thing by commenting dumb shit on my post
I didn't insult it. That message is the moderator telling me how stupid my post is.
?
oh nvm they're just hypocritical
was the mod high or something?
wtf


yes
at very least I think joining political spaces causes that
I do think peoples political beliefs have become more extreme due to the internet
that's why fundamentalists are often annoying as shit
exactly
I felt actually kind of happy for a second
idk I got a rush of energy after realizing that I offended a lot of idiots
because clearly I got under a lot of dumb fundamentalists' skin
I'm glad I did it
now that the whole situation regarding my post has blown over
tbh
my diet is whatever but since I don't always eat when I'm hungry I'm really skinny
I know if I do it more it's a slippery slope into just being a toxic asshole
I don't think I'm gonna do it again though
what danger?
I guess it was
I won't do it again but hey it was fun
how do I stop myself from going to places on the internet that I hate?
but JRPGs have different lengths than other games
yeah
I enjoy platformers
I'm 5 and a half hours in and not even halfway through
howlongtobeat lists Donkey Kong Country as 4 hours long
because for example
also I find setting up time to beat a game might be bad
10 hours is still long
but short games can't really hook me like a longer game
nope
fuck I can't do that
so
but then I will never beat a game
so that I don't feel like I'm leaving anything hanging if I stop playing a game
From now on I'm gonna list every video game I have ever played (on howlongtobeat) as completed and give them a score no matter if I actually have beaten them
for video games at least, I have an idea
because money
but I can't talk to a doctor
tv shows: i cant focus for long enough
reading: i cant focus for long enough on a book
movies: they take up too much time
games: i cant focus for long enough
nope
and I can't enjoy them
they all interest me for different reasons but all of them have problems
ive tried all of them
I'm not being pessimistic. I'm being realistic
anarchism
not anarchy
I guess if we're detatching the system from the people who are for it id say anarchism
unfortunately
the problem with that is AI isn't advanced enough for it to work yet
tbh if I went for what I value itd probably be an oligarchy controlled by AI
none of them do even that though
so as of right now I'm apolitical
I dunno. I just haven't had a political system presented to me that I think would work.
got into an argument that reaffirms once again why I try not to associate with the left
if it's two years I'm never gonna develop social skills or work skills
im talking about the article
fuuuuuck
I'm never gonna get to go to my new school!
no!
ok so from now on to resolve a tough desicion I'll just have a bot do it
and a lot of quicksaving
apart from the fact that I used a guide the whole time
yeah. I don't know how it kept me for 30 hours
self interest
that's the thing
well that wouldn't work
oh
hey, at least the political compass gave us a good meme subreddit
no one's ever explained communism well to me
people bring up blade runner or psycho pass or whatever but I don't think that'd be the case. those are dystopian fiction.
I'd trust a computer more than any person to make a good system of government
I believe that once AI is at a level where it can govern us better than we can it should
friend!
have a good snack
I honestly don't know much about communism other than for it to work everyone would have to cooperate and wouldn't really receive much in return, which isn't gonna work
yeah I mean like pretty controlled capitalism, for me
tbh I'd probably have to go for capitalism then honestly. it's pretty bad but it's the least offender.
well then I'm against it
oh
aka a society without any arbitrary system of class
if you can't then you're part of the problem
and you can try to talk things out
you can also be defensive without starting violence
because I don't want to sink to their level
yes
you don't
because that's hypocrisy
I'm also against starting violence to protect others
honestly now that I think of it
that's defending yourself/someone else though
I guess ultimately my political beliefs boil down to, I'm against anyone starting violence for any reason
15
but it means hurting
no one should be endangered
no
ok so here's my thinking:
in this situation, I'm in a building with 5 people. Suddenly 5 terrorists come in and threaten to kill everybody.
Either I:
Try to fight back which endangers all 11 people.
Or:
Don't do anything which only endangers 6 people.
By not choosing violence it isn't me who is endangering others
I dunno. I don't wanna endanger anybody
in that situation I would just be screwed
which honestly sounds like a tempting ideology right about now
"oh you don't think we can build gay luxury space communism? ok you're a conservative"
no I'm leaving because people are throwing strawmen
ok bye
people need to accept that there are times in life where things just suck and can't be changed. which is why I don't like talking to leftists because they usually don't understand this and think they can make everything a fucking utopia.
seems like you're getting really heated
which some people need to accept more
not if you can't talk things out. that will happen. in which case you're just screwed
if you attack others you are part of the problem
that's not what I mean
it doesn't matter what people think of me. this is my moral compass.
I think it's a little better
either, I fail and now I intentionally tried to hurt others, or they're still killed but I didn't do anything to hurt anyone
in that situation, I could fail
that's youre example
more people have been hurt/killed with me trying to fight
I knock all the terrorists out
they all start shooting and kill the other five people
let's say I attack the terrorist
let's take it back to my example:
I'd rather unintentionally hurt people than hurt them intentionally
it doesn't matter. it's not my intention to hurt anyone.
which is why I won't try to
that's still hurting them
^
for all you know no matter what you do everyone could die
that does not mean you are gonna save 100,006 lives
I dunno, I've been taught these values since childhood
not to me
innocence has nothing in this situation
no one
but that would result in hurting the terrorist
also my connection is kinda going down the shitter
which could have also been programmed into me by my mom, it's possible
I guess I just don't like standing up for myself honestly
I just don't like the idea that anyone is more worthy to die than anyone else
so maybe I shouldn't take it so seriously
this whole idea was beaten into me by the same person who basically wants me to be a child my whole life
tbh
wiggle room is bad though
therefore I wanna be morally grey entirely
I don't wanna choose who has to get hurt or not get hurt
but I know if I try to discriminate who deserves to die or not I'm just as bad as anyone
I don't like my ideology very much
to be honest
why?
I didn't say that
Jesus wasn't special though
because that makes me the better person
I've always known that I would have to have faith to this ideal no matter how little sense it may make sometimes
anyways, my morals are, those who start violence are evil and those who hurt no one are good
how do I curb it?
ok I have a seriously bad habit of going to places on the internet I hate
why?
the entire situation regarding the TLOU2 leaks is really stupid but I just want to point out how people on the internet can't comprehend a muscular woman
ok. we've resolved to forget that it ever happened.
do you have any idea about how I can get over my paranoia
and i was acting crazy paranoid
ok it was a joke
i think this genuinely ruined our relationship
he seems really mad at me now
they're just not saying anything now
DM
they're acting like I'm crazy but I'm being logical
this person is probably a creep
but this is what I've been told since childhood is sus behavior
I really don't wanna block him. He's my best online friend.
idk
gonna stalk me IRL or some shit
im legit worried they're like
and so I think I'm going to block them
and they're speaking in a way that I've never heard them speak before
like, they said "just one hour" and then i asked them what it meant and they said "I'm not telling you" and sent me a bunch of smiley faces
one of my online friends is acting really weird
ok
RIP
wondering if my anxiety and fluctuating self esteem could be connected
like, I feel like I somehow remember an election where the two candidates were a bumbling idiot and a bumbling bigoted idiot, but not from reality. from like a story or something. but I can't tell you where I remember it from
just had a weird feeling of deja vu regarding the election
they're just boring
my problem with shield hero is mostly the villains
yeah. I think its a little iffy but tbh it's not really that bad imo.
I dunno
I feel like they should have had Naofumi somehow set Raphtalia free after buying her, and she willingly follows him.
what's kaifuku?
what healer anime?
I can kinda see Mel and Rahkis argument but I disagree with it
again, the show isn't very complex
yeah I also disagree with that
granted, it's portrayal of women isn't fantastic, but I don't think that was the author's idea
But the show isn't just saying "all women are evil and lie"
No (which is a flaw)
I dunno I disagree
I see that as a fault of the fans and not the show
none of the characters are very complex at all
thats my problem rahki. it's just not that interesting after a few episodes.
I think it's sort of meant to further cement the world as really fucked up and requiring fucked up things to be done in order to stay afloat. Yes they could've gone about that better but overall it doesn't really detract from the show.
I understand the arguments of both sides so I'm good
It's the same points over and over again
I'm gonna leave this because it's not really a discussion anymore
I'm not saying shield hero is written well, but I don't think it's supposed to be taken as justifying "all women lie" and "child slavery is ok"
I don't think the author was trying to justify child slavery.
nothing more and nothing less
I just think it's bad writing
I think this is more subjective honestly.
people like Contrapoints are just scummy
well, if it's not intentional it's just something you need to keep an eye out for
it upsets me that a lot of people even on the left are quite ableist
this is more of a discussion for <#336297387863703552> but I just have trouble picking a medium to get into (i talked about this earlier)
maybe it's because I'm so indecisive
I'm not sure entirely
i feel like shit
I literally have very little people in this state that I actually know
suburban/rural i guess
Maryland
all I've heard about it is it's a painful grind where you want to kill yourself daily and nothing ever goes right
I've never heard any positives about adulthood
honestly I really missed out on the only worthwhile part of life
I'm just now realizing I never learned how to socialize as a kid which is probably why I'm just a blank slate of a human being with no personality now.
I wonder why I can't form my own opinions
someone could probably convince me that the earth is flat if they had any evidence and no one was saying anything differently because I'm so fucking gullible
I guess I'll just be apolitical
because I don't know any other way
and my whole life everyone else has always been smarter than me, so I'm therefore always in the wrong
I dunno. Maybe it's because whenever I try to form an opinion on something I'm told it's wrong
no, but that's where I want to be
I guess if I absolutely don't care about others I'd be capitalist
well then what's the point in government and politics at all?
but I just want what's right for everyone
yeah and it says that I'm far libertarian left which certainly isn't true
I can't figure out where I am politically
I do wanna try baseball though
I think I'll try baseball
I dunno what I could become good at
I wonder how I can build confidence in myself and my desicions
so that I finish as slowly as possible
I had the idea to limit myself to watching only one episode of each show I'm watching each day
I wonder how I can break this mindset
subconciously
I just happened to find this and it made me realize I unironically think this way

anyone else I've talked to here I don't really know and only interacted with me to tell me something to do
I only know my family and a few teenagers who are total doomers that I try to avoid talking to
(this is me saying this)

but I've already told him that.
at this point
I dunno what to tell him
of course, I've had the idea of "everyone on the internet is a pedophile" beaten into me since childhood so it could just be that making me worried
<@!99695384296701952> To be clear, I'm fine with him being affectionate, but he says stuff like "I consider you a boyfriend, on some level" sometimes that makes me feel a little iffy
I'm not quite sure exactly what this means but I'm almost certain that he doesn't understand what I'm telling him

and then he sent me this
<@!183785454447886346> he basically told me that I had told him this before and he understands (which I have, but I still feel like he hasn't gotten the message)
also about the earlier thing
in order to convince them not to do sex work
basically, he's taking nudes from sex workers and sending them to their families and stuff
what a shithead

I have this one online friend. He says he's 17 (and from the selfies he's sent me of himself, he doesn't seem to be much older than that).
I have a few online friends who I am a little affectionate with, and he was one of them. But lately I feel like he's taking it too... personally I guess? I think he thinks I want to be in a relationship with him, even though I've told him multiple times that for a few reasons I'm not comfortable with that. He also does a couple of things that make me uncomfortable. Every once in a while he will ask me to send him a selfie, and he also sometimes talks about wanting to move in with me in the future and start a relationship. He hasn't really made any sexual-related advances or anything though.
I can't tell if he's actually a predator or not.
If we're on this topic, I actually have something I want to ask about
lately I've been having this bad feeling as if I'm a very childish human being
or, at least, i come off as one
ok, that sounds good in theory
can somoene explain communism to me in as unbiased a way as possible?
yeah
I think he's stuck on this idea

thank you!
I'm gonna say "The same way I approach you. Affectionate and loving, but not expecting a romantic element to it"
how's that?

is this worded well?

what do I say
ok I think he clearly isn't getting the message
um

he is a very wordy individual.
my name is Cameron
no lol
(this is me, the blurred out part is his name)

sometimes I have felt romantic things for him, but I almost worry he forced them onto me
no
<@!183785454447886346> what do you mean by that?
I'm not sure what to say.

I think he might be mad at me now
I asked him what he meant and he hasn't gotten back to me
I'm confused by what he means

yeah, I wouldn't feel uncomfortable if he said that
if this doesn't work I dunno what to do.
no, it has a racist Jewish stereotype
I'm just wondering if I should contact the mods or not.
I mean, it's not like you have any idea who this person is. Plus they probably got it from somewhere else where it was posted publicly, if I had to guess.
hey someone posted a meme in my server and I think it might be a Nazi meme. can I send it here and ask if it is? (I'll delete it immediately afterwards)
I'm feeling better now but we still have to postpone for other reasons
I have to record my podcast in about an hour but I don't want to sound depressed
fuuuuuck
and some days I just don't work on anything at all
like, I'll often start a song, get frustrated when it sounds like shit at first and then stop working on it
that kind of happens
meaningfully
like I want to contribute to art in some way, in my life
it's more of a feeling of dissatisfaction, not really a lack of motivation
sure
ok
I'm not sure what he means

yeah we're good

if it was before our conversation I'll let him off the hook
and I don't want to, he's my best online friend
They're already at the second guardian, so it could have been before our conversation
I'm not sure actually when they started their playthrough
which creeped me out a bit for some reason
and named Ness after themself and Paula after me
they started a playthrough of Earthbound yesterday
basically
actually, nvm i'm overreacting to it
my friend did something uncomfortable again
I like politicalcompassmemes because it's a place where basically any ideology can flourish, but it's pretty transphobic there
I don't take risks very much
there have been times in the past where I thought I needed a break from social media but he kept telling me I didn't and now I'm starting to realize he just didn't want me to stop talking to him
I've realized that the relationship between me and my friend is actually even worse than I thought
uh
ok
how should I train my brain to have less anxious reactions to things?
that's what this channel is for
<@155150213445582850> I mean everybody, even extroverts
I'm scared that even when Covid has a vaccine and people can go outside again, people might not want to socially interact IRL much anymore
"You're making me uncomfortable" "You shouldn't feel uncomfortable, you have to get over it"
I think the argument is more
I'm done arguing too
welp

he's read my message but isn't typing
thank you all for helping me out, btw

he posts them in a server we're in and on his public instagram too, and he has a bandcamp where some album covers have his face
ugh
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>

15, almost 16
he's sent me selfies of himself and he doesn't seem to be lying
he's 17
alright, I think he's obviously guilt-tripping at this point

if he doesn't get that I'm gonna start getting angry
I'm gonna tell him "look, I've got my boundaries, I'd appreciate if you could respect them."

(btw English isn't his first language afaik, so that's why his sentences can be confusing sometimes)
I think quickchat as well as voice chat should exist
her points seem generally reasonable from what you are all telling me
I'm just justifying why it seems weird to me. She's probably a fine person.
yeah but plurality is an actual medical condition I think, otherkin isn't as far as I'm aware
you have to make the other side look like idiots. don't bother trying to change their minds, they won't.
that's the internet. it's not a place for making points and debating.
I mean, I'm not sure eating grass is good for you.
the deer stuff might be weird but it doesn't affect any of these people really
I saw that Keemstar tweet. Fantano actually responded with "Jesus can we just leave this woman alone already?" or something like that
I guess it doesn't affect me that much, so I don't exactly hate it. I'm just not sure it's valid.
ehhhhhh
that's uh
can someone explain why everyone and their dog is harrasing that one twitch mod? im out of the loop
which is unfortunate
I see a lot of people in far-right spaces who are unironically like this
this is fucking hilarious
https://twitter.com/FeminemiIy/status/1262493009439895552
I would be happier if I had an actual social life and used discord to keep in touch with a few friends from home
to be honest
he doesn't want me to stop talking to him
I want to take breaks often but that one friend keeps telling me I'm wrong and convinces me not to
when I get back to school hopefully in the fall I might just get off discord entirely
I will in a few months, hopefully
right now
I don't have an irl life though
I don't have any IRL shit to deal with
I dunno how to stay away from it, it's everywhere
that would chill anyone's bones
I will be emotionally honest with him and he will respect my emotions
we came to an agreement


I'm not sugarcoating it anymore. I'm telling him exactly what I feel.

I mean, I asked him about it a few times but every time he's immediatly told me I'm wrong and I would just accept it
<:kannafacepalm:638326704674308096>

because I don't want to not be friends with him. he's generally pretty awesome, it's just he does some things that are kinda creepy and when I call him out on them he gets super defensive.
hopefully this will help

It's just him going "it's not my problem, it's yours" at this point
he has been incredibly dense
ugh


he has an actual girlfriend IRL apparently but they are both poly
I don't think so
ok I'm gonna have a talk with him tonight. this time i'm gonna have another mutual friend of both of us help me out
that friend yeah
just like a regular selfie
is this creepy or not?
and apparently at some point he showed her a photo of me that I sent him
one time my friend came out to his mom about being bi
so
can I ask you guys something?
I'm not defending these subreddit's actions, because they often are nazi shitholes
Yep
I mean, no one's getting banned in the end except hopefully the people posting the CP, so there's not really any point except to gross other people out because you don't agree with them and they're breaking rules.
well also, I believe showing people you don't like disgusting imagery is bad no matter what side is doing it
(AHS is a subreddit called Against Hate Subs who essentially finds hate subreddits and takes action against them, however it seems like they have very slimy ways of doing so)
anyways, AHS is still terrible because posting child porn is completely unnecessary
but I think it's better to ban individual users unless it's a subreddit like r/itsafetish where it's designed around hate speech
that makes sense, I guess.
I'm still confused
I mean, it's silencing people of an opposite viewpoint
to be honest, I'm not sure if I agree with the idea of shutting down subreddits because people say hate speech on them.
The ends of somehow changing shithole subreddits (which is a vague goal anyways) is definitely not justified by the means of spamming child porn on said subreddits.
I think that idea is situational
for example, AHS and all the subreddits they attack. Obviously AHS uses slimy and gross tactics to attack other subs, but often those subs are shitholes. Doesn't justify what AHS does though. In this situation, yeah every party involved is terrible
to be honest I feel like I need to develop the idea that there are some situations where every party is bad
maybe Nichibros!
probably gonna finish my Eva rewatch and then watch something else
tbh, <@456226577798135808> I think I'm gonna drop Ultraman Leo, it's not bad it's just at the moment I have no urge to watch it
maybe I gotta watch nichibros at some point then
tbh I'm not a big fan of that kinda show anyways but it sucks that maybe 3 of them exist compared to the mounds and mounds of CGDCT shows
I wish there were some CBDCT shows, y'know?
man, I hate that
```they don't  include guys because "guys aren't cute"```
wait, do you live with Haru?
yeah
but if it was like biden vs an equally bad republican I would vote another party
but he's the last option
I agree
biden is a buffoon
like
(this is irrelevant because I'm not old enough to vote lol)
although if the greater evil weren't trump (or someone similar) i would probably vote a third party tbh
^
and now I'm realizing my views line up with the less extreme side of anarchism more than I thought
this came up because I finally agree with ACAB
considering anarchist as an ideology
I want to develop more willpower
I can't specifically think of any other places
but yeah now that i think about it I've never seen anything that wasn't far right shit
for a while I thought it was pretty inclusive and that it was just a few users who were transphobic
I've unsubbed
thats the main one i think of
r/politicalcompassmemes
maybe I shouldnt be on those subs anymore
this was just the generally accepted view on a lot of other subs I'm on, so I just thought it was true
oh wow
several people are saying it happened. although I don't know any actual proof and from an unbiased perspective, it seems plausible
https://www.reddit.com/r/WatchRedditDie/comments/fdvm29/rcoomer_banned/
but like, all the evidence has probably been deleted
don't actually remember where I found it
but yeah
don't look at the comments section, there's a lot of transphobia
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yUV9TyfYaEQ&t
<@!203444794737950720>
think it might be better for me to leave this convo because I think we've hit a brick wall
doing nothing is better than a lot more damage
he will cause some damage probably, but not nearly as much as another trump term
he won't cause as much damage
yeah, that's our reasoning
even my lib parents agree at this point that biden is a doofus
<@!193408538909868033> to be honest I think most of my guillability comes from a result of not having many counter arguments to stuff I hear
I'm gonna mute this channel now, seeya
ah yes! viva la revolution! many of you will die but that's a sacrifice I'm willing to make!
how do you know that, though?
long term with trump is US politics falls apart
but again, not to trumps degree
certainly
nah, he'll make it worse
let's say if you have two foods. one is absolutely bland and tastes like shit, and one is poison that will kill you in seconds. if you pick neither, you get the poison. probably a bad metaphor but fuck it.
and it will probably be terrible
I'm gonna try a metaphor
ok
which is unrelated to my original question
still, this is the quality of the products
I'm still confused
not a rhetorical question, I genuinely don't know
<@456226577798135808> what difference does that make?
I know vinyl records and physical music releases aren't so bad because the money goes to the band (with some going to the record label too, but it's not so bad)
so, quality of the products aside, what makes stuff like anime figures, toku toys, and warhammer figures not consumerist while funko pops are?
I have a question
random unsureness about my gender identity has been creeping up on me today for some reason
how do you argue against someone who self identifies as misogynist, homophobic, transphobic, nazi, etc?
I have a question
I unfollowed 2 of them (one of them is a friend so I didn't to be polite)
also 3 people I follow liked it
I get that most of the people who went to that poll probably went there from notch, but it still bugs me
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>

how would these sorts of things be handled in an anarcho-communist society?
marvel movies have a lot of weird differing tones, yeah
their movies are incredibly formulaic but they come out quickly and make a lot of money
so like, Marvel for example
that makes sense
Funko pops are pretty shit
those kinds of people upset me (tying onto my point from a few messages ago)
And sometimes they do have some merit. Like I don't talk about it here in the server for fear of being yelled at, but there are people out there who convince confused people that they are trans and tell them they need to immediately start transitioning, and that fucks them up later.
I dunno. I feel like their ideas sound so stupid to me that they have to have some merit I'm not picking up on.
I don't know why
but I will just randomly drop what I'm doing and go on /pol/ or something
I don't get anything from it but anger
you guys don't just have random urges to look at garbage?
I don't know
coping
like, when someone calls for trans rights they accuse them of "coping"
people on the alt right say it a lot
what the fuck is a "cope post"?
so, just entirely avoid debating open facists, pretty much
(I'm not actually in this argument, it's a hypothetical)
I imagine they think anyone who isn't a cishet white male is subhuman, and therefore doesn't care about those people.
or maybe they just only care about themself.
or turn it off
r
I just go around the blocke
I have tried blocking sites before
I've tried
I can't stop though
for some reason I seek it out constantly
Alt right stuff makes me angry but it doesn't really disturb me anymore
I mean, I dunno
because that totally works
they are the type to bake a cake for politicians they don't like
my parents wanted to vote warren
I see it happen, actually
I joined the discord because I couldn't find any other populated Evangelion servers, which sucks
evageeks is an Evangelion forum
also quick word of advice, avoid the EvaGeeks server, there's a few open alt right people who spread their toxic worldviews there a lot and the mods do fuck all about it
oh yeah and also, after I get to know people a little by talking to them over calling or face to face, it stops happening.
Interestingly Discord text chats are one of the few places that fear doesn't happen (although it does come up when I'm in a discord call with a lot of people)
to be honest, I think part of my social anxiety and over self-consciousness might come from feeling like once I talk to them, they will instantly realize that I'm not normal (I have autism, for people who don't already know)
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>

happens to me with my mom all the time
do any of you have any general advice for me? since i talk to you guys a lot
I'm worried she'll tell my parents so sometimes I leave things out
which isn't actually that helpful
the problem is, my therapist just agrees with whatever I say, pretty much
more often the latter
all lives matter is either a statement made out of naivety or straight up disrespect for black lives matter
I think they're talking specifically about police brutality against poc
I guess I feel like it shouldn't be the answer but probably ultimately is
not sure how I feel about this
https://twitter.com/QueenOfGeele/status/1265634003585044486
generally in these situations I try to be as indifferent as I can but that just makes her more mad
when I told her I was ok with getting an 8/10 on my test she threw a fit
also this is unrelated but my mom got mad at me again
I've sort of accepted that I'm probably never gonna be able to fix this.
I can never just stop thinking about things, and it constantly makes my life awful.
i need to talk to someone
this makes it so they can't do that
section 230 basically protects social media sites who remove content that they don't want on their platform
it's not internet censorship, it's the polar opposite
<:TsubasaNeutral:688429723205894149>

but still, I worry for the safety of someone who is actually vulnerable to this
I guess actual killings probably won't happen en masse, logically I don't have anything to worry about because I don't run any big accounts
I'm hearing this from other places
they're totally capable of it
they're gonna doxx LGBT people and go to their homes and kill them, apparently
4chan is doing an anti-LGBT operation in June
really anxious about June
but to be clear: this video is not anti LGBT, it is a warning that 4chan will be doxxing and harassing people on social media during pride month.
you know, there's other parts of the link other than the thumbnail
I'm not sure why you're upset with me warning people to stay safe
I don't get your point
to warn others
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65WXHtFzAvY
also, gotta love white kids in youtube comments sections telling jews facing anti-semitism to "grow a pair"
youtube drama is all garbage and never worth getting into
especially because they're apparently burning homes too
to be honest I think where I stand is I'm ok with looting of big chain stores, but I'm not sure where I stand on the burning
sounds like the start of facism to me
<:Thorushrug:592468985409437706>
anyways, apparently some CNN reporters who did nothing illegal got arrested
anyways, I hope it doesn't go through
so it might be legal
oh no, he's changing the law
but it's still a bad desicion
but twitter has a lot of money for a lawyer, so I doubt hate speech is just gonna run amok
basically, now if twitter bans someone for hate speech, they can legally be sued
you're not denying what is happening, you're denying the one thing that can be done now
I don't mean that kind of denial
because yes, this reality is scary
more or less, it's denial that we've come to this point
I understand what Aria is feeling right now, although I don't agree with it
gameplay was meh
pso2 i played for like an hour
yeah
I can't explain it
I dunno. I feel like my fears are gone now somehow
I mean, maybe psyched isn't the right word. It's sort of a combination of rage and hope.
I'm surprised by the fact that I'm not afraid right now. I'm actually psyched as fuck

I don't think he can actually do this. Like, he's gotten away with dumb shit but this just doesn't work.
yeah
I haven't really said anything to get my account deleted because of this rule, but it still makes me a little worried for some reason.
but Discord is still making me worry tbh
I just learned that, yeah

individual people who identify with antifa don't necessarily represent the core ideals
again: antifa isnt an organziation
this is the opposite of free speach
thankfully I don't think any of these people has actually stayed there for more than like 6 hours because the doctors don't like it either, but it's still fucked up
also, they've put people who are "too radical" in mental hospitals temporarily

I'm sorry, I went into a doomer panic for a second because of Ebola
reminder that a star in the night sky is overdue to go nova by about 100,000 years

I wouldn't be so sure about that after Covid

welp, *everyone's* dead now
and in other news, there is water in the ocean
the people that attack small buisnesses are assholes
yeah, I think most looters go to corporate chains
oh
that sounds like it could potentially be unsafe
<@186660127825330177> Hey, you can also be an anarcho communist <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(this is a hypothetical, this person doesn't actually exist)
while
but I'm not sure if that makes me really controlling or not
it's them sleeping with a lot of other people that makes me uncomfortable
I mean the other person
I don't mean myself
is it bad if I feel like I couldn't be in a relationship with someone who's sexually promiscuous? nothing against them as a person or their behaviors as long as they are safe, but the idea of it just makes me uncomfortable for some reason. is that bad?
random hypothetical i thought about
it's easy to find fake news during these times
oh, I'm sorry!
thankfully, I somehow eat at none of these places <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

yeah what krika said
we need a totally different police system
that person seems rather racist
I do worry that protests are gonna extend Covid isolation
for no reason
another night where I just randomly feel like shit
why do I always feel like I need to engage with politics?
maybe I just shouldn't tbh, it gives me a good deal of stress
thanks for explaining it
obv it does
<@226789636989517824> they just conciously or unconsciously don't recognize trans people right, plain and simple
is there any evidence backing this up?
my dad mentioned that even people looting big chains are fucking up the economy for low-income people, which actually makes me reconsider
I know several trans people who have no intention of doing anything to their genitals
not only that
(srrsly people who think trans people just want to "mutilate their genitals" can fuck off)
well, as long as it doesn't harm themself or others
you're doing great. keep it up

Oh man Yeezus is a masterpiece
I feel like that would get me bullied <@183785454447886346>
Even if that were true, I still won't know how to make friends in college or anywhere else
If I won't be able to go to my new school until maybe even after I've already finished high school, it's gonna leave me with no friends and zero ability to communicate with people and at that point I might as well not live.
I've already tried to kill myself 3 times during this quarantine and now I'm thinking of it again

thoughts on the CHAZ?
is it safe to say that when someone else turns their entire argument into making assumptions about your personal life, you've won?
Also, another thing about arguing
Once they've reached the point when they're doing that you've won the argument
if you want to preserve traditions that don't harm people, that's fine with me
I was talking about people who think we should do everything traditionally, meaning not letting women leave the house and stoning gay people
yeah
*I state a thought on a topic*
"Get out, you aren't adding anything to the argument"
people who believe all traditions are inherently good are drones
didn't know I was a reptilian
reptilians?
if LGBTQ people aren't people who are they?
i hate it

i just think this guy is fucking crazy and hillarious
here he tells people that if they don't like the same buildings he does, they're mentally ill

here is his amazing political takes
one of my favorite tweets of his is him saying "we have to go back too this style of architecture" and then using an image of a fictional building from Lord Of The Rings
and also shitty political takes too about how "the left destroys everything"
he spends all his time (not hyperbole, he tweets like every two hours or so) whining about how old architecture is objectively the most beautiful thing ever and modern architecture is a sin against god
so this guy

didn't sesame street introduce a character with autism a couple of years ago
I like it but I want to find something else
it's too much of a time sink
also, I want to drop this MMO
but if I did what I wanted to, which is drop Subnautica to watch the show I want to watch right now, then I'd not be finishing things and then I wouldn't be having fun.
but I don't know what makes me happy
basically, I don't know what to do
I'm just unable to break away from this idea
I want to be happy normally
but I don't want to have this mindset
there's a minimum but theres not a maximum
but there's not a definite length of time you spend to get to the end
I'm thinking maybe I shouldn't play video games anymore because that's not an activity about completion, it's about having fun, which I don't really understand well anymore.
and ironically enough I don't feel as fulfilled finishing short stuff because I know its short
but there's not as much short stuff
not actually playing/watching/listening to them
I feel like I've come to realise that with video games and shows and movies and albums and stuff the funnest part of them for me is finishing them.
and I think getting into Albion Online has made this a lot worse because nowadays I spend a huge chunk of my time every day just grinding in Albion.
part of that is maximising the time I spend doing these things.
I find the problem is that I don't see my time for relaxation as relaxing. I feel like I have to adhere to strict rules I've made for myself.
And generally both adhering and not adhering makes me feel bad
I'm here
I hope I'll be ok

look
I don't know if I've explained this before but the way I taught myself to jack off ended up being totally different than what everyone else does and it might have trained my pleasure receptors or whatever to the wrong thing, because I don't enjoy jacking off normally at all.
But couldn't I just cuddle with them?
Like, why would I if I could get more enjoyment in less time by just jacking off?
I'm worried that I've ruined my brain because I don't have any urge to have sex

The Relish Condoms <:PepeLaugh:723278751370051656>
the Relicondems
I didn't even know that, Haz
it literally was just "sperm goes into womb and makes children"
it didn't explain consent, LGBT stuff or anything like that
my sex education was literally just learning how it worked and nothing else
again, sex education should be better too
It's not really the porn itself is bad but if someone finds it when they're too young it causes bad expectations
I'm sure others like me have gone through similar experiences
well, at least with men, they all have extremely long penises. I've for a while felt insufficient but I'm realizing now that I'm perfectly average and I was putting myself to these unrealistic standards.
ok I just finally figured out a reason why it's bad to expose kids and teens to porn that I haven't heard yet: the body standards in porn are fucking ridiculous
I sure hope we can, and to do that we need better sex education
also, women in multiplayer games constantly having to hear gross shit in voice chat
eeeuugghhh
that's awful
where does that happen?!?
what the fuck
I'm thankful that my parents explained stuff like birth control and consent and LGBT stuff to me when I was younger, but not everyone has parents who do that
just look at the amount of people saying "anyone who has experience with women knows no doesn't always mean no"
there's no "I don't know/in between" option
also I answered that Winston Churchill was a hero because I was always grown up hearing he was a hero, even though I barely know why, so that doesn't even really count
yes
in fact if you actually understand free speech and want it, you're probably left leaning

I mean, I don't know for sure
legit pitiful lol
guy with a Pepe pfp joined a music server I'm in and dm'd several members with LGBT stuff in their pfps (including me) hulk r34
almost the end of the month and I have encountered the only pridefall attack I know of happening!
I'm not talking about people who don't like yaoi but dont mind it's existence
I mean, they're really homophobic towards gay men while getting hard to lesbians (which is also a kind of homophobia)
<@203444794737950720> it's ok to dislike yaoi and like Yuri but some people legit think gay men shouldn't be in anime at all while fetishising lesbians at the same time
it's really just a straight road ahead to unfulfillment
there's aren't many
as I watch my life get progressively shittier with absolutely nothing I can do about it
all I can do at this point is just daydream of the alternate lives I could've had
what do you expect
I mean it's turning point
that's probably why I got 40% conservative lol
half of the questions I barely knew how to answer
Chernobyl 2 is here

yeah but my parents want me to eat a meal
I don't have anything to make
all the meat in the house has been eaten up
plus there's no substantial food in the house
I'm not hungry
great now my parents are calling the hospital because I'm not eating or leaving my room
thanks a lot mom and dad
nothing new
I don't know if I can go on
apparently it also took down r/ChapoTrapHouse, however I've heard from people that a lot of people there talked about inciting violence and the mods did nothing about it, so it makes sense
reddits ban wave has taken down r/the_donald, r/Consumeproduct (one of the biggest directly facist subreddits), and r/gendercritical (basically, terf haven)
I think I might want to step out of the realm of constantly thinking about politics for a bit. I need a break.
also, one reason I wish I had friends is so that I could finally quit Discord. I'm addicted to it.
I can't feel better
how could I cheer up in a world like this
my mom telling me to cheer up for my sister's birthday party, haha
he has a huge fanbase though
(don't go to the replies please, one of the top replies is CW GORE ||a guy advocating for mudering communists along with a grisly image of an anime girl having her head blown open with a shotgun||)
"my channel is dying please give me attention"
yeaaahhhh, I'm hearing that it's only been like one leftist sub banned compared to at least like 20 alt right subs
yeah, I've heard of that
all the "anti consumerism" stuff was just a front
it had Nazi mods from the beginning
consume product was like that from the start
basically gru used to be ironically making fun of gamer chuds
they banned gru a bit ago
they banned like one or two left wing subs and a bunch of right wing subs
they are kind of the "dirtbag left", like the YouTuber Vaush
Chapo trap house is a leftist podcast
btw i wanna apologize for overusing this channel
I'm in the best place mentally I've been in in a very long time. It doesn't feel like there's any loose threads in my mind right now and I'm just excited to see what the future holds.
Another thing that happened to me is over the past couple of months i've been basically thinking about romance and sex a lot more then before, I've noticed. While this was initially hard, because obviously I'm as far from both of those things as possible right now, I've learned to turn feelings of insufficiency due to not having those things into anticipation of these things instead, and also taught myself that the fact that having sex and romance or not says absolutely nothing about me or whatever "sufficiency" i was worried about before.
I've also made several friends who go to my new school, which has helped me out quite a bit.
Another thing that's happened is that I'm kinda starting to ignore online political discourse. I know where I sit vaguely and can develop my own opinions on things, which is enough for me, and I've found online political discourse just kinda brings me down (which is why I'm probably not gonna be active in this channel after this).
so, I've realized that one thing I was doing wrong is basing my self worth on validation from other people. this was in turn sort of turning my personality into a bit of a formless blob. So I've been able to keep in mind that no matter what others think of me, I don't need to bend my values to fit others. This has helped me to gain a better understanding of my personality and my values, and has been a major boost of self-confidence for me.
alright. I guess I'll just find something better to think about while i wait.
so i was just in this discord call with a girl at my school
and
they were talking about relationships. and where do I even start, but to sum it all up before I begin, the way they talk about relationships makes me not want to be in one, at least during high school.
I'm not gonna say everything they said, but the general vibe i got from the way they felt about relationships was that they didn't really seem to hold it on an intimate level so much as a performative one. It seemed very much like they were more interested in just picking up someone, dating them for a bit, and then just leaving. And I can't imagine what the point is other than to brag to your friends about it.
And the irony is, she was talking about how she was so mature with relationships, but this was my mindset in like, 9th grade. If this is considered "mature" I really don't want to have anything to do with high schoolers lol.
I just want someone who I vibe with and where both of us make each other happier than anything else could. Maybe this is just one person and I'm overthinking things, but the way she talked about this stuff really bothers me.
also this might get me to stop thinking about romance so much now that i know it won't happen for years
and might get me to stop worrying about lockdown as much as well
since i know it's not really gonna get any better
i'd be fine with just asking a good friend who i think is attractive if they're down to hook up.
i'm not worried about losing my virginity in some super special romantic way now
but also relieved in a way
i'm a little dissapointed
tbh
do... what though?
but there's no real reason for me to get up
there are things that make mundane life easier to bear
there isn't really a lot i want to do though
it'd be like sleeping your whole life
because otherwise everything would just be boring
an actual struggle
also conflict makes the mundane even more appealing too
I don't know what I want out of life. I just want it to be fun, varied, and interesting. It's none of those things rn.
I don't really have a story at all. Life's pretty aimless.
i find myself sort of boring i guess. also, I don't have much to think about. my life is very boring not just to tell others about but to live in.
and even then there's plenty of struggle
which is why it's so appealing to me
not really. apart from romance
yeah
its not about entertaining other people. its about feeling like I'm part of something bigger myself.
but living my life simply isn't interesting to me
?
but just entertaining myself is boring and unchallenging
I have several hobbies and none of them make me feel fufilled or like I've made a mark on anything or have any interesting story to tell.
so I won't be bored. so I'll have a real problem with real implications to deal with
i sure wouldn't
but it makes life feel boring
I also haven't been involved in a lot of real conflict
Maybe that's why I think about love so much. It feels like my only chance to be important in any way.
I've never made a desicion that had a major impact on... anything. and I doubt I ever will get a chance to.
It's entirely possible that I'm feeling sad and down because I'm not important to anyone or anything.
You know
there's nothing for me to think about that's happening right now
i don't have anything now
I'm still not thinking in the now
but thinking about the past doesn't do anything either
i think about the past sometimes too but i dont think about it extremely a lot
there just isn't anything in the now to think about
but I want to think about something in the now
I mostly think about the future and hypothetical romance and stuff.
yeah
and there's not a story i can tell about my own internal problems
nothing makes me keep constantly thinking about anything but my own internal problems
i might see something and have a mild reaction to it and keep going with my life
i'm bored because I have nothing to really seriously think about
not when I'm bored literally all my life
but I don't want to be bored
I don't understand
but that still doesn't do anything for me
it just makes me forget i'm extremely bored for a little bit
when I'm finished watching kamen rider I don't think about it afterwards
but stuff like kamen rider doesn't make me any less bored. it's a mere distraction.
I don't really find anything significant though, I guess. I just want something to feel significant.
I don't want to climb the tree
he wants to climb the tree though. for some reason.
i still don't get why this applies to me though
it just doesn't make me feel fufilled
i watch shows, listen to music, and write poems
but i do stuff
but i dont like that
what do i have to live for then?
it's just kinda "huh nice" and then it's gone
most art doesn't
it won't really make an impact on me
its not gonna make any impact on anything
idk how
because if there's nothing more significant, life is just boring
yes
i cant distract myself most of the time
again thats just a distraction
i'm never solving any problems though
again, i can't force myself to like stuff
anyways there isnt much i enjoy
but I don't know what i could do to make an impact
but I don't want to be ordinary
my problem is that I haven't made an impact on anything and have no interesting stories to tell about myself
i think we've been sidetracked though
i cant force myself to care about something
i cant just make something significant if it isn't significant to me
thats how i feel about almost anything
it's a lot of work sure but there's nothing to show for it
it isn't significant
and i'm left with what?
i just do it and get it done with
i don't think there's really a story i could tell someone about it or anything
why is that interesting?
lets  say i set a goal to having listenet to 1000 albums by the end of 2020
i guess the takeaway is
-I need to spend time thinking about the past more
-I need to think about stuff I enjoy
-I need to know what I enjoy
i think that might be the core problem here. a lot of the time i feel like i need to justify why i enjoy things.
do i need a reason to like things?
honestly when shit hits the fan we're gonna get a massive uptick in suicides and I don't blame them much
but the upsides are usually less obvious
yeah I think pretty much everywhere has some major downside to it.
like it might just be better to off myself if society collapses. I don't trust people to put together a good economic system. I feel like it would just turn into fascism, monarchy, or feudalism
there won't be medicine
what do I have to live for when that happens?
but also I'm not sure why I'd want to survive
I've got a few conditions that would probably make it impossible
idk how I'm gonna survive the civilizational collapse and regression
ok I am feeling less pessimistic now. I don't think the collapse will be complete and utter insanity, even if it does happen
I feel like there's a massive and cataclysmic cultural regression coming and no one can stop it.
I try to be an optimistic realist in general but within the realm of politics I often become very pessimistic.
yeah
I guess I worry about stuff because I have a good friend who lives in Venezuela and his quality of life is immesurably terrible right now especially due to the pandemic, and it makes me fear something like that over here.
anyways I'm done rambling but point is I have very little faith in my ability to stay alive once the bloodshed inevitably starts
at this rate
its another reason I don't think society will function. us zoomers will probably regress to tribalism
you can't just have political opinions, you have to pick a very very specific ideology and follow it to the letter
what I hate about talking politics with zoomers is that it's all about being part of a group
it's why I don't trust society to work
not as many as the zoomer leftists but still
there are a worrying amount of zoomer fascists
young people are just more extreme
I live in the U.S.
when everything falls apart I'm either going to get killed or do it to myself
one of the many reasons I think it's bad for me to get into a relationship is I don't really trust myself to stay alive. I'm pretty weak mentally. and I'm not really in shape either.
she's kinda reverse-sexist in a way that makes it so you can't tell if she's joking or not, and she also talks about relationships a lot in a really immature and performative way. and she also talks about zodiacs and peronality types a lot. apart from the sexism(?) she's basically just an average teenager but for some reason talking to her makes me feel extremely irritated.
this girl my friend invited into our discord is that for me
you ever meet someone who makes you really uncomfortable by just being around them but you can't explain why?
they also might've gotten scared off because of some of the aspects of my sexuality. like not wanting monogamy in a relationship or certain fetishes I've brought up in relevant conversation.
i mean, i asked them if they wanted to talk about it. i remember one time i brought it up out of the blue but most of the time I'd ask if they wanted to talk and if they did I'd talk
<@!175076569868402688>
i think i scared them off by constantly talking about all the shit i've been thinking about internally lately. but what else could i have done since it's literally the only thing going on in my life right now?
coming from gen chat
I don't wanna be pessimistic because that's irresponsible but I just don't know what I could do anymore
it's so hard to stay optimistic and hope that your choices matter in this world
no
well, I can, but I can't go into my real issues
I have a therapist and I feel like I can't talk to her over virtual
anyone know any other ways I could make my brain happy again
talked to my mom and she says no antidepressants
i hear anti depressants are really bad for you
I think one day my brain just decided to stop being happy
I don't even know why i'm depressed
i dont think there's any way out of being depressed
i just don't extract any enjoyment from it anymore
i literally can't feel happy watching anime anymore.
i wish i could do that but my brain just won't let me
but now I feel like it's wrong to feel happiness except whenever i make fun of other people for being happy about something which seems the slightest bit meaningless to me
watching anime used to make me happy
man i wish i was immature again
I know I'm supposed to "live for today" but I can't because I feel like I'm always thinking about my lack of purpose
i just can't find any purpose
yeah the more i think about it i don't really have any reason to be worried
anyways it seems like she wants to hang out another time so I'm gonna put this feeling on hold rn
<@!175076569868402688> yeah
none of this is really based in reason, i just have a weird feeling that something isn't quite right
Ultimately for now I'm just gonna try to invite her next time we hang out. And if she does the same thing I'll start getting suspicious.
I guess if that was what scared them off, i probably didn't want to hang out with them anyways but that also sucks
Anyways I don't know any of this for sure.
-I asked her to get discord so i could add her to the group chat that everyone else was planning the  hangout in. some of my friends have anime pfps and anime-related usernames
-I post mostly about music on my snapchat story
-She only told me that she had something else that came up last minute when I dm'd her to ask her if she new the address of the place we're meeting up at.
I don't know for sure but there are a few things that could have scared her off
I'm a little bit worried that I scared this person off
while I don't think it's my ultimate purpose in life it's a good reason to keep going for now and it'll probably hold out through my whole life
I think I know kind of a secondary purpose of mine which is to continue to evolve my taste in the arts
like I do stuff that will make me happy but internally I don't try to feel happy.
see I'm wondering if internally you need to try to be happy too.
I guess what Im asking is, do you have to choose to be happy when good things happen to you? I thought you just became happy instantly but maybe I'm thinking about it wrong.
is it possible for me to just make myself feel happy when I do something that's supposed to make me happy?
I'd reccomend finding something like that. sort of an emotional reset button, I guess.
like if I'm feeling really down and hopeless I try to go down to the swings in my neighborhood and listen to music while swinging. it calms my brain down a lot.
do anything you can to make yourself comfortable y'know? that helps me
phew thanks
I think it's a genuine concern.
?
hey, do I need to worry about how the economy will be in a couple of years when I'm gonna go to college/start working?
<@!175076569868402688> yeah, and if it's that i feel like that will wear off
back then I was like "HOLY SHIT POP MUSIC IS SO BAD PINK FLOYD ARE ABSOLUTE MUSIC GODS"
nowadays I'm just like "wow I like this velvet underground album a lot"
<@!183785454447886346> well, I kinda alienated a past girlfriend by talking about music! but I think that was more because when i was 14 i was really fucking pretentious about my music taste
sheesh
I stayed at a table away from people and I think my parents tried to socially distance in the pool but still
my family went to a big crowded pool
i'm gonna be honest i'd probably be mostly happy if i could stop
about love
yeah during that time i want to learn to not care as much
i actually think edating is worse for me than being alone
i *cannot* edate sorry
i'm talking about dating though
cause of coronavirus
i cant really meet or go out with anyone right now
so how does one get there?
as in, it's helpful, or difficult to accomplish?
i wanna feel perfectly content without anyone else
given the current state of the world
its painful
i still cant stop thinking about love constantly during the less involved times of the day. is there something i can do to stop this?
there's actually something pretty major for me I feel like has changed but I've gotta make sure first before I feel comfortable talking about it
as painful as Covid has been I'm gonna come out a much better person, I feel
I've wrapped up a lot of the problems that I've been having and I'm working on fixing even more of them. but I'm mostly just waiting for change.
I have been feeling kinda meh lately y'know?
and don't invite too many people
it's fine to go out and interact with people sometimes if you take the nessecary precautions
good
I've hung out with my friends every couple of weeks but we wear masks constantly and don't get too close to one another
for myself at least
this shit sucks.
thankfully my family take Covid pretty seriously. I'm not super worried.
that's part of what makes it meaningful though
sometimes i wonder if this is gonna stunt my development in some areas or something
sadly this is the worst time possible for that
so i doubt i'll ever be able to get over my constant thoughts about love then
so humans aren't really natural machines at all then
if there's something life-threatening potentially on the line it's harder for me to, but otherwise i can do it to an extent
i can depending on the situation
that worries me a little
maybe people can't control their emotions using logic
and the "getting sick of someone" thing can be helped by making sure each of you has some space sometimes
eh. if there's no logical root, emotions aren't a problem
point is i'd rather find out than not. maybe that's my problem
still I think it's a problem that I feel like I can't be entirely happy without being in a relationship so I need to change that.
I know relationships are a lot of effort and work but if I were to get in one I'd rather I put my blood, sweat, and tears into that over basically anything else. 
Online relationships don't work for me because I simply don't feel as comfortable talking to people online as I do IRL, in general.
And the only experience where I've been around someone so long I've gotten sick of them is my family during quarantine, and I already just kind of tolerated them before quarantine anyways. I don't think people getting sick of one another is an inevitability so much as it has a high chance of happening, but even then you can also find ways to deal with it. 
And I should also mention that I don't really think I'd get shaken up a lot if someone broke up with me because that just means it wouldn't have worked anyways, most of the time.
now that I woke up
ok getting back to this
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
sad to see you go, but we all need breaks some times. remember, we're always here when you come back!
the idea that no matter how objective and solid your reasoning is, peoples feelings can't nessecarily be changed, is kind of disheartening
after the last convo I was in here my opinion on people is a lot lower tbh
no it didn't
something else is bothering me a bit, but there's gonna be some sort of partial resolution to it within the next week or so, and i dont feel comfortable talking about it until then
(imo)
that's the right way to think
no you're fine!
possibly even 6 months if I'm feeling really optimistic and nothing else extremely bad happens (which we cant count on)
i'm confident treatment will improve/they'll be a working vaccine/both within the next year
i was talking about social distancing not myself
why?
no
anyways, it wont be here for a whole lot longer so i'm not super worried
SomeOrdinaryGamers has a series on the deep web that's actually pretty cool
but his commentary videos which make up most of his content suck ass and have the most braindead generic Internet takes
yeah from what Kat is saying the movie just kinda sounds cheap but not really malicious
yeah if that's what you're worried about I'd just watch it
I'm sure they wouldn't just put actual child nudity in the film
(I'm not gonna watch it though because the film just doesn't interest me at all)
eh if they aren't comfortable I understand. but I'd develop my own opinion on it first.
https://youtu.be/vae_UVCzfio
he made a video like "j.k. Rowling did nothing wrong" or something like that where he spouted off a ton of transphobic bullshit
I remember him
that guy is an actual transphobe
oh wait Disel patches
yeah like obviously this is gonna get review bombed, it's the internet's new TLOU2, regardless of anything about it
From what I've heard from most people who've actually seen it, its supposed to have a message of "adults oversexualize children" or something like that, which makes the marketing campaign even worse. I could be entirely wrong though as I've never even seen clips from it.
maybe i dont need to change myself at all and i just need to accept sadness
and of course it gets immediately taken away from me
I finally find some happiness and something to look forward to
I can't get any stability
ok epic I just had another suicidal breakdown
my computer, any chance of having real friends, my health, any chance of making any meaningful change, all of it
I've lost absolutely fucking everything this year.
I'm feeling very violent right now.
I've just had this problem lately where I don't do anything I enjoy with my free time. I just sit around doing nothing because doing something enriching feels like too much effort.
Sometimes I'll listen to music, but I don't count that because whenever I do I'm just skipping through songs and parts of songs just to feel some sort of stimulation and not actually engaging with it like I used to.
see there have been movies that have waayyyyyy more disturbing and pedophilic content on-screen but use it in a way that portrays it as disgusting (as it should). Some of them are even considered masterpieces by film-watchers like S√†lo
nice
didn't Rick Riordan write a genderfluid character in one of his books
And we won't be stuck here for long term.
I think it's good to hope but also keep in mind there's a good chance things could fail.
I see Biden as a way to buy time rather than a figure who can make meaningful change tbh. But a way to buy time is a good deal better than what we have now.
For me I feel like however this race goes, it's gonna be close. Trumps definitely gonna fuck with it.
dems arent great but they're a little better than republicans
i'm confident if Biden takes office dems will become the majority, especially if Trump is tried and put in jail, because that  would probably result in similar things happening to some other republicans who are involved with him.
keep in mind im half awake rn so my logic might be slightly flawed
is my perspective
so if we can at least regulate them that could buy us some time before more radical change happens
<@!399293953171521549> trump supporters arent really the ones who matter here, its the corportations who are causing the emissions
oh God that's horrible
idk
maybe this is because of not sleeping at all last night?
im feeling really disconnected and alienated from things today for some reason
I don't like Vtubers for the same reason I don't like streamers in general, but in a more exaggerated way.
since I have autism
I'm lucky that I was born into a relatively affluent family because if I had to go to my public school it would have been horrible
yeah
plus there's really no way to grade intelligence. everyone knows IQ is bullshit.
that's more what I think
can you send me some data on this?
> Americans are also more inherently dumb on all sides compared to the rest of the world
even if it does somehow go through the people will hold him accountable
but this is such blatant dictator behavior, it won't go through
he does do a lot of illegal and unconstitutional shit
he does a lot of posturing to seem like he can do anything. he gets maybe 2 out of 7 of the scary things he wants done.
no he doesn't
no? you can't just pass an unconstitutional executive order
I don't think trump can just like, pass an executive order and not have it go through other people
he's posturing
it is illegal
I'm trying to break it
which hopefully more people break soon
it's like a vicious cycle
I've seen this in myself as well
can i talk about how I've noticed how people of different genders and gender expressions don't seem to trust each other a whole lot and that makes me a bit sad
obviously there's a huuuuuuuuuuuuge problem if people actually believe that though
If it's a roleplay thing that people don't genuinely believe it's not that bad imo. maybe i'm missing something though.
I looked up the gorean thing and I'm kind of confused. Is it just a roleplay thing or an actual genuine ideology that people believe?
I hate the internet so much
glad i'm not in texas
I feel like I'm always unable to commit to anything I wanna do and just laze around
I feel like I can't be happy or comfortable with things nowadays
ok here's something I want to bring up:
Equality: Everyone has the same starting point. Some people may have issues that gives them disadvantages.
Equity: Peoples starting points are more personalized and different, but makes sure that everyone is at an equal level of advantage.
Justice: The problem is solved entirely so that equity and equality don't matter (not always possible)
idk if that's accurate. I just got that from reading tweets and discord messages.
what I'm gathering is Biden made slightly more logical arguments, but he came off as a bit senile (as usual). Trump on the other hand spouted bullshit constantly the whole time, he may have come off as more confident but anyone with a functioning brain could realize he doesn't have one
I didn't watch the debate
that's good advice Iskierka I'll remember that from now on
update: It seems like the accuser has been proven to be a 4chan troll
ah, i must have misremembered
<@676272618839605249> I can't remember if you were a JPEG fan or not but if so you might wanna see this
TW sexual assault
and now......
I've never been a massive JPEGMAFIA fan, but I've loved several of his songs
oh my fucking god

yeah i've been saying "well, he can't exactly complain, based just on how he's handled this" as opposed to "fuck trump i hope he dies" or some shit like that
https://twitter.com/RationalDis/status/1311991838522445825?s=20
https://twitter.com/Hbomberguy/status/1312210702279426069
so idk how much higher a chance over Trump of winning he'd have
Honestly, although Pence might appeal to never trumpers, he doesn't have the cult of personality that Trump does.
Ok.
Do you think Pence also has Covid?
or roles people have to conform into
then what is it
culture is at its core assumptions of people based on meaningless shit
gender is at its core simply sexism
i mean i think culture is dumb and conformist anyways but that's besides the point
what's the meaning in gender
there are so many other things that give people identity though
what positive things does gender do?
if that's not true it's confusing and clunky and needs to be done away with
gender is roles that society made
but... that's not what gender is
cause then we get shit like "catgender" which doesn't make any fucking sense
it would make much more sense to just abolish the concept of gender entirely so there were no gender-based divisions between people at all
but abolishing the binary would make it worse
which it already is
i disagree, i think abolishing the binary would just make gender a confusing and meaningless distinction
I'm sort of feeling kinda bad just thinking of the idea that you can't abolish gender. i sure hope that's not true.
the scientific consensus on gender is that it's a completely made up concept and has no grounds in biology or the brain, right?
idk why i just never meet anyone I'm romantically or even sexually interested in IRL. my standards aren't like, that high.
i think people need to be creative with how they think of themself
instead of just attatching themselves to words and letting them dictate how they should think
it gives people roles to conform to
i think gender dampens self expression tbh
and not hierarchies
i think people should associate those things with themselves
no
we're just abolishing concepts that are entirely built on assumptions
why won't they
so, you want people to make assumptions about you?
gender, and culture, are assumptions
i dont want people to make assumptions about me at all
yeah being seen as a music fan is bad
no because racists generally don't understand race
<@!203444794737950720> yes
which can only be solved by just abolishing both
but there isn't. people make fun of each other on the basis of gender and culture all the time
see i guess i wouldnt have a problem if there were no negative characteristics attatched to gender or culture
but that's why that's bad
but i get the vibe that if I said "i'm a music fan" and someone assumed I was not accepting of other music tastes and then said "I'm accepting of other tastes" they might not believe me
that's not the problem
but being hungry just says that you're hungry
because all of those say things about you that may not be true and you probably weren't intending
but you don't have to identify with labels like "music fan" or "woman"
me listening to music says nothing about me other than that i listen to music
but the thing is
i'm against identity because it divides people
i am someone who listens to music and plays games
no i am someone who uses discord
i dont have any identities
i am somoene who does things as opposed to someone who is things
but then what does the identity mean at all
what if someone sees you as weak because you are a medic though.
I'm a gender roles abolitionist now
ok so I've changed my mind
I don't see any meaning
at all
what does it mean
but now I don't get it
I thought gender was a set of expectations and roles you wanted
no matter if your intent is to fit or break them
never mind im leaving
but like why would you want to identify with a gender
yes i know that but what does it mean now
what is gender based around
ok let's take this back to gender then
but the identity is the assumptions people make about you
it's pretty unhelpful and makes me get really defensive so I'd appreciate if people stopped doing that, for future reference.
I've noticed that often times when I don't understand something and end up in an argument with people in this server specifically, lots of people will dogpile on me in a really destructive way.
Btw
s
lets see how tomorrow i
wait i forgot to take my meds today
im starting to think maybe the reason i take everything overly literally and seriously could just be an autism thing that i'll never be able to get over <:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
(and i dont count "anarcho-capitalists" because they aren't really anarchists)
i guess american anarchists are a minority political view in the population
i know the chinese government is super authoritarian so them having info that i'm an anarchist could be potentially bad? but idk how much worse it is compared to the corporations that already know that.
and yeah
i'd have to auto-update
and i use android so it doesnt make a difference to me tbh. i could find the APK.
alright. thanks for the helpful info! <:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
me. like is my data getting leaked to the chinese government or this other company? (does it even make a difference?)
<@!99695384296701952> so is it still unsafe to install the app?
hey can someone explain the whole situation regarding the chinese government and tiktok? im out of the loop
See i think that would just move them farther right. Also the status quo is bad but I would rather the status quo over millions of people losing what little human rights they have left.
(Not denying that Biden is a corrupt figure)
Why would that be better than voting Biden in the big picture? Curious to hear your thoughts
I can accept that
I'd argue that principles are conflicting here but honestly I think I've seen enough.  I don't have anything else to say
But sometimes you need to make hard decision
Belive me Bidens full of shit
I empathize with where you're coming from and your anger but I disagree
But 4 years of extra time gives us time to make the population more alert to the rise of fascism
In terms of fascists in general possibly!!!
I don't think a second term of Trump specifically is possible if he loses this election.  There's a loooooootta things known that he's done that he can go to jail for.
phew
im also hungry that might be it
(for context earlier today I bashed my head against a wall a bunch of times, not super hard, but it could definitely have caused an injury. i felt a mild headache for like a half an hour afterwards and felt mostly fine until now)
hey if I'm reading the symptoms for a concussion, and then suddenly start feeling dizzy, and then stop reading them and go back to normal, that's placebo right?
these people are an actual cult

maybe that'll make me be fufilled. i've been selfish this whole time
I'm gonna stop living for myself and start living for other people from now on
you know what
I guess most of the reason I hate being an extrovert is because most of my interests and hobbies are mostly held by introverted people
If you're an introvert you're lucky as shit
I hate being an extrovert
Hey how do I become a genuinely unique person? I'm worrying that I'm uninteresting.
I don't trust my own decision-making and couldn't describe myself if held at gunpoint
Yeah well I dont really know who I am
No id spend it on things I like
i literally go days without spending time on hobbies that i actually enjoy and just spend all that time talking in discord
but if i did that now it would mean cutting off my only source of human contact
if i wasn't stuck inside my house 24/7 i wouldn't have this problem. i would just block all social media
actually i use it on my pc the most because i spend all my time at home due to quarantine
I think i'm addicted to social media to the point where it stops me from doing stuff i enjoy. How do I cut myself off from it without cutting off my only contact with other people?
Those labels don't mean a whole lot
But truthfully
I generally tell people I'm an ancom when asked
anyways i've realized the idea of having "no personality" is bullshit
as long as you think for yourself that doesn't apply
still getting tested though ofc
so he may not have covid
my dad can still taste food
Unrelated but why the fuck do people say weed isn't harmful at all????? Because doing research makes it seem to me like it can cause lung damage from smoking
I dont think i wanna do any drugs now if the drug that everyone is saying is 100% harmless is actually really dangerous
Ugh. I cant wait 3 days for test results.
I guess we don't know if he has covid or not, all we know is he's really really unusually tired
Well i mean if he has it ive got it
My family doesn't wear masks inside the house or social distance unless someone else is there
All my irl friends hang out irl barely socially distanced all the time and I just stay inside 24/7 yet I'm the one who gets covid
Im scared of the long term effects of covid. They have like a 1 in 5 chance of happening even if nothing serious happens.
He's getting tested today
My dad may have gotten Covid
that they absolutely deserve
i think they're getting some kind of consequence from the school
yeah
so today our school had an assembly about consent
and there were a bunch of freshmen who were spamming "simp" in chat
fml
I honestly don't know what the good aspects of myself are
I need to figure out an actual reason to live. I was waiting for quarantine to end but I dont think that will fix shit plus its at least like 5 months away. And before you say "your family and friends will be sad if you die" thats not the point. I dont plan to kill myself, but I'm not really happy or motivated at all right now and I need to change that.
good news is i'm entirely asymptomatic, and the rest of my family is also either entirely asymptomatic or is facing very mild symptoms. so lets just hope i dont get any lung/heart conditions from this
yeah
i have covid
no one can understand or relate to me especially in my generation my inability to stop taking everything seriously pushes me away from other people i cant take a joke i can't see sarcasm i'm pointless without others i'm gonna be a recluse forever i'll never have any friends i'll never get away from the internet i'll never be interesting to anyone i'm a boring person nothing will ever be fun for me i'll be stuck inside my stuffy awful house at my computer forever no one has any reason to talk to me
im waiting for the mail in ballots
eh
i dont feel like there's any reason to get up in the morning, I don't have any hobbies
So im scared to go to sleep
And now I have covid
My immune system is probably fucked because I havent been sleeping well lately
I might die in my sleep
because whenever they're online together they're playing Among Us which is a game I don't like
and because of a combination of school and covid I almost never see them IRL
i just never see or talk to them
I have friends IRL
so I'm dealing with 2 problems
1) I don't think i have any reason to get up in the morning. I don't really have any hobbies that even interest me enough to try, let alone give my life meaning.
2) I feel extremely alienated from other people.
If anyone has any advice please let me know.
that doesn't make a difference
oh I voice and video chat all the time with them
so i want to focus on the first one
so i've accepted that i probably won't solve that problem for a long time
when i'm online with people i dont really feel like they're there or that i'm talking to them
being online with my friends doesn't really make the alienation aspect any different
even then honestly
no they want to play Among Us
so i'mma wait
yeah i cant find like, any major news source reporting on it
alright
is the new york post good? idk
https://nypost.com/2020/11/05/vladimir-putin-planning-to-step-down-next-year-report/

i've honestly been put off from taking drugs because i've realized there's a really sublime and toxic peer pressure to it
i had the idea until very recently that the only way to be creative and wise is through drugs because of all the people who say it will "expand your mind"
i generally can't focus on shit in general
how do you get yourself to do that
but like
but how do you stop wondering about the other option after you've made the desicion?
like what game i want to play
what if it's purely an opinion thing though
ok i've been running away from it for long enough but i need to deal with my indesiciveness and be able to stick with and get the most out of the desicions i've made
how do i do this?
Anyways im hyped. Finally things are coming to a close, at least where I live.
But I'm not a doctor so I could be wrong
So getting both vaccines could pretty much mean immunity
Also apparently the flu vaccine gives you some level against Covid
but you don't realize until it's too late
i don't really get fooled by that kinda shit... at all anymore. after the events of the last 6 months especially
i wonder if i am
i mean how i consumed content back then was pretty different to now
im not quite so much like that anymore
but what do you mean, "why"?
are there reasons someone is guillible?
thats good
so i feel kinda dumb now
about a year and a half ago i didn't know if "tr*p" was a slur or not and so i looked it up
and i found a video essay of a feminine guy saying it wasnt and bringing up poorly sourced "evidence"
and for a little while i thought this was good
eventually i just naturally grew out of that idea from actually talking to trans people, and forgot about the video
and recently i figured out the guy who made the video is a right-wing grifter
(hit enter by accident mid typing)
can i talk about it?
i realized something that makes me feel really guillible
https://www.cbsnews.com/news/pfizer-covid-vaccine-effective-data/
majority are disgruntled students yes, and there are some trump supporters who go to the school
i mean iirc Sandy Hook was just some older guy
it's possible that i'm trying to cope with worry because my extremely progressive school is a prime target for a mass shooting in the wake of biden's victory
idk maybe i'm too cynical
they exist to keep the working class in check
the police dont exist to keep people safe
like that'll ever happen
but the ruling class are gonna squash them when people really start making change
there are other options
i kinda feel like part of living in the real world is being prepared for violence
it was only bad because lenin died
btw if you're LGBT you should absolutely arm yourself
they don't actually feel like they're in danger.
that's just an excuse
<@!263534352422404096>
i more so care about the revolutionary aspect
> and they do not change things
<@!278860841485598720> tell that to russia in the early 1900s
you're about to say "police do" arent you
i'd rather a few people die over taking away the one mechanism by which people can keep themselves safe and change things
other than gun control which is bad
but what do you do about that
sometimes i feel like only local news stations should talk about school shootings tbh
i think mass shootings are gonna happen in every society and there's no avoiding them without sacrificing the rights of people
i wanna say "the problem is people put too much value in their own lives" but i feel like that sounds kind of sociopathic so idk
i feel like under capitalism career goals can't really happen.
i have literally no idea what career i want to go into
i live in anime, games, music, etc to keep me distracted
there's literally nothing else going on
i mean my life at this point is just waiting for quarantine to end
i guess it's sense of accomplishment in the face of uncertainty and challenge
like idk
but danger could and probably would take away the baseline things that make life enjoyable
a life that isn't boring requires some degree of danger
any life that isn't scary is boring and any life that isn't boring is scary
i've realized it's not just that i consider my own life unhappy. I can't imagine an enjoyable life.
alright so i guess i'm still against most gun control in the off chance that we need a revolution, but i think mass shootings will happen less if we had better mental health resources and widespread teaching of gun safety.
I still have a similar idea of an ideal anarchist society from before but i think reform and nonviolent revolution are more pragmatic options before any kind of violent revolution, and if that were to happen, it would have to be decentralized.
and because of that it's not worth it to try to make it enjoyable
ive thought for a while that the reason life sucks so much is that it's a transitionary period between whatever was before and whatever was after
maybe i need to change my outlook on life
come to think about it it is kind of suspicious how all the leftists i know who are against gun control fetishize guns so much
living is really painful
religions with reincarnation are actually the worst
of course i mean the most to myself in my own eyes, but i'm trying not to think that way
i'm not talking about through my own eyes i mean the whole world
what do you mean by that?
i dont think my life is worth more than the happiness of the entire working class
is at least what i'm trying to tell myself
i dont matter much in the grand scheme of things
i mean it's better that i die over the whole population having no way of revolution
i'm in high school
nah
lol
Some kind of sport
You know what else might be interesting, and I can do more immediately (at least as soon as quarantine ends)
Actually I've been a little interested in psychology
i experience all of these symptoms of MDD

WHAT THE FUCK
political =/= partisan
but it's still political
oh it shouldn't be a partisan issue
Im not convinced to be that cynical yet
Im gonna be real i don't think the vaccine is gonna cost hundreds of dollars per person
Sorry I just came in
Wait are you saying white people aren't superior or that white supremacists don't exist anymore?
i dont stick to them super strong though
but my mind kinda needs expectations. its just how my brain works.
yeah i can see that
This is the most politically  level server im somewhat active in so if I want to validate an idea i come here
<@284390402210136064> yeah someone was going full doomer in another server im in so to calm my nerves I decided to think about it logically and post my thoughts here
From recent testing
<@278860841485598720> the Pfizer one is 90% effective
It would fucking stuck if they have to keep social distancing because a bunch of idiots refuse to get a vaccine
I have friends and relatives who live there
Im just hoping people in the more red states actually get the vaccine
My reasoning for being optimistic is
A) I could be wrong but its the government who will be distributing the vaccine and not Pfizer themselves. By the time its available to the public, Biden will be in office and I feel comfortable hoping he wouldn't price it ridiculously high.
2) if it were priced high, the economy would continue tanking because the working class would not be able to get the vaccine and go back to working semi-normally. The losses are far greater than the gains.
that's really depressing
but honestly i dont even think they would really benifit from doing that long term
oh god i hope they don't privatize it
idk. we'll see. if the numbers are to be trusted i'd say it's likely.
let's say both the Moderna and Pfizer vaccines both get approved for use
Will there being 2 vaccines means that more total doses can be produced?
it may be stupid question but
i have a question
i don't think i've been praised by someone who's opinion genuinely mattered to me in a really long time
you know what ive noticed?
which is probably a bad thing. how do i change that?
i havent really genuinely felt like someone else's opinion mattered to me for a while
or i guess i should say
What famous characters did he voice?
my friends all got into relationships during quarantine
it cant just be quarantine
idk i just wanna know why i havent been able to mame many relationships happen for so fucking long
no
yeah i'm incompatible with everyone
this is my punishment, i'm gonna be lonely forever. i wanna bash my head in
i have no one to talk to
i dont  have  a good relationship with my family
i hate that most other teenagers nowadays just think a friend is someone who you just play video games with
i hardly ever get to actually talk to people
whenever i try to say something or start a conversation they're like "ok cool" and then go back to among us
all my friends just play among us all day
I just don't wanna be lonely anymore
i dont care if it's the default or not. i dont care about being normal or whatever
i feel fucking dead today
i'm so lonely idk why all my friends are in awesome relationships/don't want to be and I'm here having never experienced that shit
i dont know what i'm doing wrong
I used to watch that piece of shit when I was like 13
Don't make me remember
Oh God rags
found out the reason i've been depressed for the past couple of days is actually because i forgot to take my meds for a couple of days. i feel pretty normal now.
i'm in like 4 different online communities
and always conveniently forget to invite me
although conveniently they're always hanging out with each other pretty frequently
and whenever i try to hang out with my friends they're always busy
i cant do that
there's no opportunities to meet new people rn
I don't want that though
i cant live like this anymore
idk. that's like, months away for me. and years away for some other people.
yeah
i have plenty of hobbies. right now i cant use any of them to meet people.
when i stopped talking to my friends for like a month none of them checked on me
people only talk to me when they feel like they have to
i'm just a skinny upper middle class white dude. there are so many people like me. i'm entirely uninteresting externally.
i dont know why anyone would want to talk to me though
but what am i supposed to do after that
no but it'll have an impact on me forever
everyone else is just fine but i'm screwed.
and i'll never learn because of quarantine
great so i'm screwed lifetime
Yeah that might be for the best actually
Im not implying theres something wrong with heterosexuality
Yeah exactly thats my line of thought
Is it really? Its just a suggestion
And someone told me this was forceful
I pretty much said "I would recommend straight people question their sexuality at a point, because we live in a heteronormative society where that's the default and isn't questioned"
I got into a debate with someone in another server
Gonna start using that
Tomgirl sounds like the best one actually tbh
I just say "passing femboy"
i actually havent done that
yeah i voice chat with them but it doesn't feel like it's enough
oh i just associate them with porn lol
prob shouldnt suggest that to me, i'm a minor for future reference <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
like League isn't very fun if i'm not playing with a friend
i think i need to do more activities where i dont depend on other people to do them
yeah i watch 3 at most at a time and still fall out of sync
i stopped keeping up with seasonal anime largely because i'd end up falling out of track
well AOT 4 is coming out
yeah i'm very extroverted
i think it's mostly the social aspect tbh
maybe i could hyperfixate on getting really good at League or listening to a lot of memphis rap or something
but still 4-6 months is a lot of time
yeah i live in a very liberal part of america
i think where i live we'll still be wearing masks but won't have to socially distance much in the time frame of march-may
it depends on where you live
I need some advice. I don't know how I'm gonna get through the rest of covid.
fun fact the guy who made the "why trap isnt a slur" video that goes around a lot is actually a pedo and uses nazi dogwhistles
this is the article i found on it
https://transgirlmedia.wordpress.com/2018/05/28/felix-argyle-ferris-rezero/
like what they are, and how Ferris is trans-coded
can someone explain LGBT-coded characters to me?
Specifically, Ferris from Re:Zero. I'm doing a research project for something.
districoict
Im hearing that its either a marketing campaign or an art project
Theres one in Romania now
So is there any explanation for these metal obelisks?
(And that the US approval follows shortly)
God let's hope it does the trick
https://twitter.com/BBCBreaking/status/1334032020947734535?s=19
The poster said that's photoshopped
that too
also from what i've heard, de-transitioners are fairly rare. From memory something like 0.5 percent of people who transition detransition.
if you change your mind, you can go through the AGAB puberty, just later
yeah
this is from the mayo clinic
I can't think of very much that I'm proud of myself for. how do I change that?
so gender dysphoria is simply a product of transphobic society
hey so can someone elaborate to me why gender dysphoria isn't a mental disorder? I've genrally understood that it isn't but I don't know the reasoning to back that up.
but that doesn't help me figure out the facts
2020 has put an overly pessimistic wool over everyone's eyes, and I don't blame them.
for news stuff
this year has kinda brought me to the point of not trusting anyone
iirc you take puberty blockers till you're an adult and then start taking hormones
it has the same problem
-underdeveloped physical features (weak limbs)
-not just short, but like, genuinely *small*
-childlike features (e.g. face)
it's still pedophilia. just like in the way i'd argue being attracted to a character who is canonically underage but looks 19-21 isn't pedophilia
yeah and it's still a depiction of what is physicially a child engaging in sexual acts
a body specifically exhibiting childish features
not small body
if you're into lolis usually it's because you're into the small childish body
ageplay isn't the same
you can feed your interest in all these things via roleplay. you can't really do that with lolis
I've literally seen it happen
the problem is it feeds a disorder that if left unchecked can and will harm others around them
that's pretty normal
<@!297554276539170826> i wanna clarify that if you just think lolis are cute but not in a sexual way that's not lolicon
btw here's a study on how a very large percentage of people who consume child porn have admitted to abusing a child
the difference is pedophilia is a disorder that can fuck with your brain
hentai isn't a realistic medium. but children in hentai generally have pretty anatomically accurate bodies. it's the face that's the unrealistic part.
that's why you need to go to therapy to get it in check so you aren't a harm to others
it can happen if you keep feeding your urge
one of them was a good friend of mine
ive personally seen two different teenagers get groomed by lolicons/shotacons
"damn westerners"
if you are a lolicon, yes i would say you have a mental disorder
lolicon correlates with pedophilia which is a mental disorder
and anatomy
because it translates into real life too. lolicon is fairly realistic, in terms of the body
or consenting adults, if thats what you mean
or around there
because boys and boys having sex doesnt harm anyone if they're the same age
i don't think we should burn them at the stake. i think we need to get them therapy and assistance to dull their attraction.
alright i think this has gotten out of hand. i want someone to just easily list what makes lolicon not pedophilia.
yeah maybe don't say the n word
OHHHH KKKKKKK
your arguments are bullshit and not convincing me
you're equating gayness to pedophilia
ok i'm not even gonna get into the implications there
yes because lolicons is attatched to pedophilia which is clinically a mental disorder
ok but even gore hounds don't have a mental disorder
i'm a fan of doom and i play it because the gameplay is snappy and fun
you're watching lolicon to see a small child get fucked
games dont lead to violence because you're not playing games to see blood spurt out and limbs fly
yeah short flat women exist. i dated a girl who was very short and had small breasts once. i can tell you, *she did not literally look like a 7 yr old*
like it's obviously very unrealistic
i mean, if an artist draws a child but with massive tittys or something like that and that's all you enjoy at that point it's kinda whatever
you're not litearlly attracted to the ink
you are attracted to the drawing of a child
even if they are 30303003 years old, their body is still a childs body, which is the point of attraction
https://web.archive.org/web/20080528040559/http://www.mayoclinicproceedings.com/pdf%2F8204%2F8204sa.pdf
lolicon is child porn. it is a child engaging in sexual acts
yeah this isnt' gonna end any better
they lie about everything
but you can't trust pedophiles
of course they're gonna say they aren't into real children
i do however, know that there's a risk that can be stopped
i cant read the future
about lolis specifically sorry
but what's exxaggerated? apart from the face
i'm not talking about tropes or whatever. as an artstyle in a vaccum
anime, the artstyle alone, is fairly realistic
tell me what's the anatomically unrealistic part about the *body* of a loli. not the head, the *body*
i have and i've argued against all of them
what the fuck
https://twitter.com/acvalens/status/1340338322326106112?s=20
i'm sorry i'm just feeling down for other reasons rn. i think i've been sitting at my PC for too long
i dont think all previous extroverts (quarantine has turned everyone who stayed inside into an introvert) were stupid maga people
stupid maga people are
it just really set in for me
i think normal socializing is kinda gonna be dead even after quarantine
the internet is the future of social interaction
people just won't really hang out in person that much anymore
which is kinda depressing
you know what i really hate
the idea of some "hegemonic LGBT ideology" pushed by right-wing media
like this concept is picked up by even centrists nowadays
like you ever notice how when two different LGBT people say things that contradict each other because they're different fucking people with different fucking ideas and experiences people will say "THE LGBT COMMUNITY IS TURNING ON ITSELF FINALLY!!!!"
not even just right wingers. lots of normal people get behind this idea too
may be a bit of a hot take but i'd honestly classify this as a type of mild internalized LGBTphobia.
or when an LGBT person says something stupid everyone will go "wow the LGBT community is toxic as fuck!!!"
like, please shut the fuck up
Rest in paradise, legend

like for whatever reason his livestreams just were never funny to me
i stopped watching him when he started streaming
yeah
i dont think he's a pedophile because the age difference was 19 and 17 but he was definitely slimey and manipulative
i watched carson when i was 14
why arent they FUCKING DOING ANYTHING
if they havent at this point they never will
protesters have fucking broken into government offices. they have no reason not to call in the national guard
they want this to happen. that's not why they're not calling in the national guard
im starting to get worried
i'm really worried that the national guard hasn't been called in yet

HAHAHAHAHA WHAT THE FUCK
https://twitter.com/always_margot/status/1346578062700400647?s=20
do you think there's any possibility of a coup? like, will the national guard just not get called in?
anyways ive calmed down now, ive realized they dont really have a leader at this point or any organization and are just causing chaos. i think its gonna be under control sooner or later. but until then if you live over there in DC PLEASE STAY SAFE. keep a weapon on you if possible and have an emergency exit to your house.
jesus i thought i'd gotten over my anxiety
the tear gas calms me down a bit, it seems like maybe they're starting to realize the severity
anyways
the government has a right to fight back against a fucking violent white supremacist takeover
i dont care what their right is, they're white supremacists
WHY NOT JUST SEND THE FUCKING NATIONAL GUARD IN
no they arent theyre treating it like a picnic
oh god at least somoene's doing something
just something a bit funny, to keep our spirits from getting too dark
https://twitter.com/faineg/status/1346815005359013888?s=20
<@!100447011131654144> yeah someone's gonna die and at that point they have no reason not to do shit
i think they're gonna reverse it eventually.
i think they may have because there havent been any confirmed deaths yet?
i dont believe in omens
fucking virginia of all organizations
The discussion ended a while ago but im still fairly pissed off
And he just ignored me
Yeah I told him almost all of the BLM violence happened as a direct result of police intervention
And when I told him that this is fucking terrorism he said "that means BLM is a terrorist organization too"
I was arguing with a "centrist" friend who claimed we need to forget this and it has no implications and the BLM riots were worse
God
This skirmish is finally starting to end, at least in DC
Any major updates as of an hour ago
One minute till people start getting arrested for real
Parler KekW
yeah i saw
This dude is really just larping as a Far Cry villain

can i vent about something ive probably vented about before but need some reassurance on?
oh man that first tweet got me so excited
Trump floss
^
Lmao
One time I didn't know who Margaret Thatcher was and someone posted a "yay thatcher is dead" meme and I thought it was something recent and came here and announced it
<@266379640069685252> I have done this in the past lmao
what does that mean
that's all?
like thinking about all the workers who are just slaving away where all there is in their life is work, it just makes me really question why these people are able to cope with it
everything is so exploitative
wdym?
how do yall deal with living in such a dreary world
This would be so good if it is passed
Or at least, the unabashed lunatics are
Hey, this means they're screwed now
ok, i'll do that next time he brings it up
(i doubt this is the only thing weighing on him but it's all i can really think of rn)
i'm really not sure what to tell him in these scenarios
see i've noticed that he feels uncomfortable being a cishet dude. a lot of the people in our friend group are LGBT. and he makes comments about feeling weird about being the one straight cis guy a lot.
hey I have an old friend who is definitely going down a neo nazi pipeline
he sends me homophobic hate speech memes because he thinks they're just funny, and he'll say he hates nazis, but he'll also say that the election was rigged and that BLM riots were worse than the capitol thing
and he gets extremely defensive when i try to call him out
My brain is probably just telling me to quit doomscrolling but idk how
If they asked about my messages that would be a mega red flag yeah
The most worrying thing they'd find would be far right forums that I doomscroll in. I obviously am not even remotely right leaning but for some reason im just addicted to the pain I get from browsing these places.
I always do non monogamous relationships so she most likely wouldn't be worried about porn
In a relationship
Im just wondering if its like a bad thing to wanna keep it private
Idk this is a hypothetical
Should I let her?
Hypothetically my girlfriend wants to go through my search history
Ok uh
need to talk to someone rn
Wonder what qanon is up to rn
I mean of course I could ask my partner about a non-monogamous relationship. I'm asking mostly of in the scenario where they decline that.
Former
i'm worried because I don't feel like one sexual partner could satisfy my sexual needs. is this like, a normal thing? or should i try to work against that?
ok so i'm confused about some stuff and need some advice about it
i was talking about online communities, but yeah i get what you're saying
any community that considers all outsiders the enemy is probably a toxic place to be
probably good advice until things are under control
i'm trying to understand why one would support the genocide in AOT but not real life genocide
i'm not arguing this
give me an example of this
because the enemies tried to kill you
that's a different story alltogether though
it doesn't make sense to me to have different standards for reality vs fiction
ok i can't understand supporting fake genocide though if you're not gonna support real genocide
and these people are obviously awful
i guess i'm biased because my first encounters with people who support eren were nazis that believed attack on titan is a metaphor for real life and white people need to kill all the other "races" and restore their "purity"
i'm against genocide for any reason
well both sides are bad. i think that's the point
||if you think that the innocent marleyans deserved to die, that makes it so that your logical position is that any citizen in a country is responsible for what the government and military of that country has done||
well
i mean, i think what someone thinks of a fictional genocide in some ways influences what they think of real genocide.
||the situation in attack on titan should be regarded as a tragedy resulting from unresolved built-up conflict, I think, and not a glorified story of uprising.
Again, I'm talking about people who glorify the genocide itself. not just people who say "i see where Eren is coming from"||
||i'm not saying there's a peaceful way to solve the conflict in Attack On Titan, I don't think there is, I'm just not comfortable with people glorifying innocent genocide||
||it's also presented as that they've been brainwashed to think this way. Eren himself literally says it at one point||
alright yeah that's what i thought.
i mean "dude the other innocent people deserve to die, fuck them"
i dont mean like "i dont think the genocide was good but it's just the logical progression of what was happening"
i dont think that makes sense to me
basically guy advocating for genocide in a story claiming that it doesn't matter because it's fictional
that's different though. I'm not talking about what you would do if you were in a simulation where your choices didn't really matter to you.
||this sounds ridiculous to me so i wanted some input from other people||
hold on i'm gonna go into attack on titan spoilers:
||I'm currently arguing with someone who is in favor of the genocide happening in Attack On Titan currently (not like "it was bound to happen", like it's a good thing) and they're saying that since it's a fictional story their views on the genocide and stuff don't matter to their actual beliefs||
hey is it possible for someone to have a different moral compass for fictional stories than their actual real life moral compass?
i think that's what solo is referring to
i think some people just look at fiction as a way to see things happen
it also depends on how emotionally invested you are in the story
fiction can be used to say things about reality. to me that makes it a lot more interesting actually.
i think it's highly contextual
thanks for explaining it to me
alright that makes sense
so i guess some people just interact with fiction in a different way than i do
that says things about you
why would you take pleasure in death and genocide though
*story
but s3 and s4 are part of the same sotry
nah. no one does. people aren't rational actors.
thats... what you just said
so that means you're ok with this genocide even if it was real
i'm not talking from a storytelling standpoint right now. i'm talking from a moral one.
not what you think is the good choice in terms of writing
so i'm asking more what you would have done in the story
i'm not trying to say the genocide is "problematic" or whatever
ok let me rephrase
i'm trying to understand what reason someone would support genocide in attack on titan and not support actual genocide. because how it's presented in attack on titan, that doesn't make sense to me.
if we're using the video game idea, lets take, idk, Doom for example.
in Doom the demons are programmed to come after you and kill you on sight. They are designed to murder you and so it's ok if you murder them, because you have no other option.
in Attack On Titan the marleyans are just regular people. They've been brainwashed to hate the Eldians, but that's just because of their enviroment and upbringing. It's shown that it's possible to undo this with characters like Gabi (in fact, it's fairly easy to do). Marleyans are not grunts that are programmed to kill Eldians for no reason like demons in Doom are. To me it doesn't make sense to compare them.
no
again
i dunno i like to actually think about the media I consume and how i interpret it. it feels like we didn't read the same manga because there are a lot of moments where AoT actually asks of the reader to engage with it's themes on their own level. to me it's very obviously not morally cut and dry.
why not
because how you look at that genocide in the story depends on your actual views of genocide
because this whole thing is a conflict between two governments
it's still political by this definition
but at the same time
alright i was wrong
hold on
in fact i think thats the dictionary definition
nah for me political is anything relating to power
hold on so what is your definition of political?
to say otherwise is incredibly naive
attack on titan is very political
what? stories are political wtf
Is fear of guilt by association reasonable?
idk if this has been talked about before here but there's this seriously bad anime airing this season that you've probably heard of called Redo Of Healer. If you're somehow not aware of it already it's generating a lot of controversy because it ||tries to justify the main protagonist raping, torturing, and murdering a bunch of people under the pretense that it's revenge, and also apparently also has homophobic symbolism and subtext in it||. the way that a lot of the anime community seems to adamantly defend it is really saddening to me and reminds me of how fucking awful the community is, which makes watching anime difficult for me.
That had more to do with the overall anime community having an intolerance of any progressive ideology and often tend to be to some degree accepting of far right ideology. This doesn't make anime bad, it's just that I like to talk about anime I like, and when I look into anime communities online more often than not it's at least a community with a lot of edgy dicks if not outright bigots.
im sorry with my first message i think by mistake i implied that redo of healer being bad invalidates all anime or something, judging by the response for which i've recieved
there are some weird fashy undertones in goblin slayer (the goblins being very weak and very scary at the same time is one of them) but it's not really a substantiated theme in the story so if someone likes it I don't judge them a whole lot.
shield hero has incel-y undertones and weird slavery apologia but i can understand the average isekai fan not seeing anything wrong with it initially. although i'd judge them a little if I explained the problems to them and they refused to listen.
goblin slayer is just kinda boring to me
i think it's reasonable to judge someone who says shit like "i'd do it too" when they watch Redo Of Healer
have to disagree on "unfairly"
In redo of healer, you're shown the victims crying and being visibly mentally ruined. And with the exposition and setup of the story, its written so that you're supposed to sympathize with the rapist and enjoy this torture and mental abuse. Shot composition is done in such a way to sexualize the scenes, and the cruelty scenes are long and dragged out. You're shown the "hero",  who has been exposed before to have been wronged by this person, laughing in glee. The overall theme is that the woman deserved all of this because she wronged the "hero". 
And before you say im reaching, I've been on anime forums and I've seen a bunch of dudes who say "id do it too"
In doom 2016, you just instantly kill demons. They dont have any psychological torment. In fact they aren't shown to have a capacity to be tormented. They're practically designed to be a force of nature.
Let's take doom 2016 as an example of a violent video game
So
Idk if you're doing this on purpose but you're just not engaging with what im saying
I dont remember goblin slayer well so I cant say much of it but I remember hearing something about the original LN writer being anti Semitic.  Which is kinda weird when that same person writes a story about a guy wiping out a race whose existence is only a net negative to society
I dont know if you read the sentence I typed, but I literally said that I wouldn't judge someone if they like Goblin Slayer in spite of the weird shit in the show.
If you're talking about Redo Of Healer, the show doesn't just have rape as a plot element, it goes out of its way to write in reasons that its "justified". If someone's watching it and enjoys that, I'd say its reasonable to assume they have some messed up ideas about rape and revenge.
shield hero has a lot of incel-y undertones and there's also direct slavery apologia
||he also does this in creative and torurous ways. like breaking a girls fingers, or having her gang-raped in a burning building||
thats not me saying that
i dont think anyone has rape coming
i mean
they show the main character geting abused by his future victims, when the rape happens it's portrayed as "they had it coming"
my problem with redo of healer isn't that it's basically rape hentai, it's that it's basically rape hentai, but sold as kinda a narrative, and with thematic elements that heavily try to justify the rape
also i'm not saying everyone who enjoys redo of healer is automatically bad. if you literally just jerk off to it as rape hentai but acknowledge that the main character isn't doing the right thing, that's fine.
i wouldn't right away assume outright. but i'd have it as a possiblity
i mean, if i see some media that has fucked up ideas as a key theme, and see someone who likes that media, i'm gonna wonder if they have those ideas
But yeah. If an anti Semitic person writes a story about a big armored guy wiping out a whole race of ugly creatures who serve no positive benefit to society and are simultaneously measly and weak but also a horrible danger to society and the women of said society, for me at least that raises some red flags
Well that was a while ago. My thoughts on that now are that you can or can't separate art from the artist and its a personal desicion. But also, when the artists ideas enter the art itself, that is not the same situation
Not even really a fan of her music but she seems to have had a huge positive impact on underground music. She had so much more she could have done.... RIP

yeah
all the plot points are fairly predictable
ngl shield hero and redo of healer from a story perspective arent really good at all at least in my opinion
like, all the characters have the depth of a pizza box
oh yeah also the loli stuff
lots of support for her!

the original tweet was about people who just randomly bring up how much their life sucks in normal positive conversations with no warning. i'm not sure what the "judging" part is about entirely.
circles was the one who brought a previous conversation about shows into it
Alright sorry about that
I havent really experienced you as being too overbearing
The wording is a bit weird
The tweet i was posting was about people who take every opportunity to tell you about how much their life sucks
It was? I just said that if someone was watching a show that defended revenge rape I'd wonder if they also think revenge rape is justifiable a while ago
Yeah it has nothing to do with what I just posted
Why are you so hostile lmao
These kinds of people have caused me to leave entire servers because they're emotionally draining and I dont wanna constantly deal with them
https://twitter.com/jadevrisrezi/status/1358131815781986310?s=20
i love anime boys as well but these accounts somehow go overboard in a way i can't quite place
basically I've been observing some weird fujoshi accounts lately and have been trying to understand why they make me really uncomfortable
Dunno whether to talk about this in serious or general chat but I chose here to be safe
what do you mean by that?
most of my IRL friends who are girls love yaoi but they don't constantly obsessively fetishize it
its not just that they love yaoi. if it was just that i'd be a hypocrite since I also love yaoi
well, idk about this light novel but from how you're describing it maybe it's an exception? but idk. it feels like usually when rape is explicitly shown in media it's either played for shock value or sometimes even glorified.
basically there's no thematic reason to show the act of someone being raped. not rape within the story and it's aftereffects, which is ok as long as its handled well, but an actual detailed account of the rape itself.
long story short twice today i accidentally overstepped people's sexual boundaries without intending anything sexual and now i feel like i just shouldn't be allowed around people
on second thought that's more personal stuff and i should find someone else to talk to
i mean, the first time was a complete accident, but i still feel sick
twice i overstep peoples boundaries regarding sexual stuff in one day
fucking kill me
my favorite is the headline "not again!"
reactionary in the twitter anime community
üëèüëèüëè
I mean in real life
I mean I can make changes but there isn't anything I can do to meet new people
I literally can't though, because of quarantine
My life feels like its been the exact same for the past almost 2 years and I can't do anything about it
I just don't like how life never changes for me
Think im gonna wait till I feel normal again to talk to them. Itd be difficult otherwise.
Well yeah, but im having trouble accepting that. It feels like I cant keep living like this.
Im not really upset that *they* rejected me, im not even upset with myself. But I feel kinda lost now
So as I said in gen chat I got rejected by someone I've been interested in for several months
had a pretty large fanbase of simps
Most people don't though
Yeah I understand the intent
But how are "men are trash" posts useful generalizations?
But I feel like they have negative psychological effects on others that should be put into consideration
The thing is I understand the intent behind a lot of these "men are trash" posts and I typically wouldn't disagree with their intent
I hadn't really heard or thought about it from the perspective of trans men before
What was more interesting to me were the harmful effects, especially on trans men
I see trans women and enbies say it too
I guess I dont think its a dogwhistle nessecarily
Thoughts? Interested in hearing some other perspectives
https://m.imgur.com/bKur7xa
But what if its my friend?
I cant just like, avoid it
Idk I see these posts all the time from people I don't even know
OP also says it plays into the TERF idea that women need to be "protected" from men
Well in the original image I posted it was some trans men who developed internalized transphobia because of these vents
just found out one of my favorite youtubers is actually really shitty
ugh
i'm afraid of seeming terminally online
so i figured out that i'm not afraid of seeming geeky
(before you ask why it's here, it gets into discussions about how women are treated in anime)
pretty great video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P4V3vEleTyE&t
Yeah
Yeah
It may be possible to make a good isekai story but very far from my preferred setting
Isekai in general is just boring to me. I like my fantasy worlds to be really fleshed out and isekai worlds not only tend to be really generic to one another but also have zero depth in worldbuilding
yeah that's what the video went into
yeah even though i havent seen re zero it seemed pretty interprative but it still makes sense
Coping with what?
Ive never understood being this unhealthily obsessed with fictional characters
Its not that I have changed political views suddenly I just don't know if I really wanna be invested in these channels
Im gonna distance myself entirely from political youtube for a bit
I feel like its become a part of my personality which I dont like
idk. i'd be a cartoonishly pretentious asshole at times, pretty much. but i'll find a way to make it enjoyable. like the joke is being played on me, sorta
i'll try to almost be a satirization of myself sorta
that sounds good
first of all, I joined a youtuber/streamer group. and i want to be able to figure out how to seperate my videos from becoming me. I just wanna make videos for fun during the pandemic and probably won't do it much after the pandemic ends, I don't wanna become my videos. (I'm mostly gonna be making anime and music analysis sort of stuff)
I need to talk to someone and ask some questions about two different subjects
That doesn't matter because I can criticize media while still enjoying it
Probably not
Or at least in that way
Im not gonna lie i hate trying to utilize escapism personally.
But idk everyone has their tastes
Not for me
i think it comes from ideas that makes sense but it gets some very fundamental things wrong
i think when i was a young child my parents must have incentivized me to just agree with everyone around me because now that i look at it i see in a lot of facets of my life i just try to please everyone
how do i stop this?
I feel really bad now, im sorry <@722121666641133608>
I literally just opened discord and saw the words "air fryer" and immediately posted the meme and then realized I was in serious and assumed "oh well they must've been talking about something else and gone on a tangent"
Oh wait I wasn't looking at the context I thought it had gone to a different more casual discussion
Holy fuck thats such bs
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
Alright that makes me feel a little better
Did it just go away eventually for you?
I DO THAT TOO
does anyone else feel like they're trapped inside their brain? I never feel immersed in life. I am never really focused on anything and I'm always stuck thinking about other things and never thinking about what i'm doing. When I look at things I don't feel like I really see them. I thought it was just because i was sitting at my computer all day but now i'm going to school some days and even then I don't really feel like i'm there. Idk what to do.
https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.businessinsider.in/science/health/news/1-in-6-gen-z-americans-are-lgbt-the-highest-rate-ever-recorded/amp_articleshow/81219722.cms some more positive news for y'all
I literally didn't understand until I was like 15 that a lot of people have very misinformed views on consent
Thankfully my parents were competent and they taught me about all that stuff and other very important stuff like safe sex, consent, and LGBTQ+ stuff
I literally never had sex ed in my school
There was a conversation about sex ed earlier
There just isn't that feeling when its over online
I got to hang out with friends in person at school every day
You know why?
I used to feel like my life was meaningful like 2 years ago
Id just feel psychologically terrible if my whole life was just getting to the next day
Its not something I need to feel ashamed of
What am I gonna tell everyone else?
I dont want to live if there's no sense of adventure in my life
Idk. If nothing of importance ever happens to me why should I live? What am I gonna do?
Because its me really existing in the actual world as opposed to me existing in a disorganized jumble of code and ideas
When I do something in tf2 it doesn't feel like I'm really doing that. But if I do something in real life I am the one controlling myself and doing that
Anyways back to the tf2 thing
Idk I feel lost when I dont do things for some sort of purpose
Everything is for personal development.
With these things I dont feel like I've actually contributed towards myself
Minecraft maybe but I dont like minecraft
You dont really have experiences in tf2 imo. I just treat tf2 as a game to keep my hands busy.
Ive tried to organize stuff but they dont want to. They just wanna play Jackbox or Minecraft in VC all the time
That's a reductive way to look at it. There's not much that can be done online but with irl friends you can have real experiences together
And you build dependancy
The internet is addictive
Im worrying it does
So im thinking of dropping those friends, good idea or bad idea?
And I have plenty of online friends. What I need isn't another online friend group, I need people I can consistently hang out with in real life.
I think they're becoming terminally online
I need some advice about my circle of friends
Hey has anyone else lost friends because of the pandemic?
At least where I am teenagers are somewhere not far off on the priority list. Idk how actually tactful that is but thats what I heard.
Yeah I have vaccinated family members now
Maybe I need to stop assuming that when I feel bad it's my fault
Huh
So im not doing anything wrong ?
I want to really experience things
I am tired of just hearing about others' experiences
Im also tired of saying something positive and then people dogpiling me and telling me I shouldn't feel positive which happens in almost every online community im in
And that's fucking ***normal*** to feel
I dont understand crypto whatsoever
so women who are sexual assault victims should keep forcing themselves to be friends with a man who watches a show that is designed for the purposes of glorifying rape, or else they're pieces of shit?
It would also 100% be abused by TERFs
I think its important to make walking at night safer for women but I dont think a super early curfew for men makes sense logistically
But I still stand by thinking that it's ok to judge someone for enjoying media where the main theme is "rape is needed sometimes"
Im aware that its possible to like something because of how terrible it is (I partake in this myself) but if I hear someone likes something and I dont know anything else about them im gonna assume they genuinely enjoy it. If I knew this person, I might ask them why they like Redo.
If they said something like "its so bad, its like watching a car accident happen, you can't look away" i would think that's a bit insensitive but I'd probably  stop caring much at that point. If they said something like "idk, its just cool to see terrible people get what they deserve" or something like that, I'd stay the fuck away
Im sorry, I posted what I said earlier and immediately forgot I said it. It was very provocative and uncalled for.
Thats my only reaction
Holy shit
i want to rant about some weird feeling ive been expeirenceing for pretty much the entire quarantine and want to see if anyone else feels similar.
I think for a while ive had this unconcious feeling built up as if i'm not a real person anymore. I think there's multiple factors to this, some obvious ones like lack of real social interaction but also some other ones that I don't think are quite as well known such as simply spending a lot of time outside the house and doing everyday stuff. I think above all it's that I don't really have many ties to the world that aren't basically entirely supplanted with technology and don't require me to leave my computer or phone. It makes me feel like I'm not really a person doing stuff in the world and like I'm just an observer from afar.
I don't think it's gonna last any longer than quarantine as long as I make it a point to have real meaningful interactions every day, go on lots of outings, etc, so I'm not exactly worried about it but it does weigh me down from time to time and I wanted to see if anyone else felt like that.
like that one dipshit youtube guy
eh i mean ive known of several far right femm dudes
but it's not really representative of femboys as a whole its just some niche community IIRC
there is actually a "femboy community" somewhere on twitter i think that has a reactionary problem
yeah thats what i was trying to get across
gender non conforming
yeah that makes sense. ive grown up in a time where twink is just like a normal identity, i can see how it could have used to be an insult though
same with twink. i haven't seen any evidence to suggest these words in and of themselves are slurs yet
i feel like theres a lot of left leaning people who self ID as femboys as well
i dont think i agree with that
honestly i think if lefties want to have more of a foothold on youtube they need to make other kinds of content aside from "why reactionaries are bad #130270". like i dont think it's bad content but i dont think that alone is gonna pull many people in
actually technically two but one hardly uploads and also does other kinds of content
i'm glad that i did end up there because i think my political views were largely improved by it but I think eventually you just grow out of it. there's only really one political channel i actively keep up with nowadays and it's just someone who i find personally entertaining
but the community is fucking terrible. and i just got bored of a lot of the channels making the same videos over and over again.
i used to be pretty involved in like, lefty political youtube around a year ago
<:Zababies:672238628398956594>
although the parts about people "being woke to get clout and fit into a group" are definitely a tad overstated the actual analysis of the subject matter seems pretty on-point imo
probably the most reasonable thread ive found on this topic
https://twitter.com/AsianGuyStream/status/1379457356833120258?s=20
ok. i'm just gonna try to stop thinking about it and proceed as usual
that's the thing. i don't know if i really know her yet. so i'm not sure.
1) i'm 16 almost 17
2) my last relationship was almost 2 years ago
3) we've known each other for less than a week, which is why i say i need to get to know her more
4) yeah
nah like we send each other hearts in like every other message
nah, we're both really affectionate to one another
holy shit dude
...wow thanks
idk. i guess the core is i'm paranoid that suddenly they aren't into me and are into my friend instead.
yeah but that's like, casually
i dont mean good atmosphere i mean i dont know if i should start something serious when i dont know her that well
1) we actually met because she thought i was really cute
2) we haven't known each other very long. we haven't even gone on a date yet. so I don't know if it's the right time yet.
continuing from <#336297387863703552> 
basically i recently met this girl, i have a huge crush on her and she also most likely has a crush on me.
anyways yesterday I was in a VC with her and some other friends and she started like, ERPing with one of my other friends
and i didnt say anything but it's making me feel really paranoid rn. it's not that I can't deal with her being with someone else but since we aren't in an official relationship or anything it makes me feel uncomfortable. i'd probably want to do an open relationship but since we haven't really gotten together yet it makes me feel really paranoid
what do i do?
That sounds pretty neat
This is a problem with straight smut as well but it tends to be more overt when it's there. While in yaoi it's more like dubious ideas of consent.
A lot of yaoi fetishizes rape, coercion, that kind of stuff.
There are definitely valid criticisms about a lot of yaoi, coming from a pan dude who likes yaoi.
Even though there's a lot more to it than that.
By just quickly saying "people don't care about reason" you free yourself from having to put effort into discussing/arguing in good faith because to you it doesn't matter anyways.
Eh I'd see that as a thought-terminating cliche. An understandable one though.
Thanks so much.
We're both in the united States
However I don't know what number exactly to call and what to say to them. I know his address, but I'm not sure exactly what to say.
We now have an arrangement set up where next time it happens he's gonna dm me and I'm gonna call CPS.
I have an online friend whose parents are both incredibly abusive and incredibly gaslighting
I need advice
I dont watch it as much anymore. Not because of the weird stuff I'm just not really interested anymore.
MHA has some weird depictions of women
I have friends who are MHA fans but that doesn't make them sexist

If not though, maybe try reading the communist manifesto
I think it should be pretty self-explanatory
<@183785454447886346> if you want a book that explains in fairly easy terms the end-goal of how leftists would replace capitalism, The Conquest Of Bread by Peter Kropotkin
one of them is also right wing. the other is a centrist liberal, but the fact that theyre siding with a right winger isnt a good sign.
seems like the new people arent a whole lot better
one of the top posts on the subreddits now is literally just an ecchi image with nothing whatsoever added onto it. it's literally not a meme.
and the "memes" themselves are as unfunny as it gets. and quite often pretty bigoted.
that subreddit is total dogshit
Thanks
Good idea, i can ask them
So I feel like I cant find an actual IRL community that I feel like I can be a part of. I clearly don't really have a place in my school's community. Its not that I feel lonely, I have quite a few good friends, but I feel like I dont really have a place within anything really. Dont know how to deal with this really. Any suggestions?
you have my absolute respect
(i am personally in favor of actually dealing with student debt, not whatever the fuck this is)
this is absurdly situational
wait why does this even exist

i'm disgusted
<:petoday:591030154285809677>
i think i changed my mind on misandry
benifiting from the suffering of others is never a truly positive thing for anyone involved. it's not something anyone should have a right to.
Hey i need someone to dm. Have some anxiety i need to work through
Yeah
People around me wont stop talking about sex/dating all the god damn time and it genuinely just annoys me a lot at this point and idk how to avoid that subject.
Hey i need a place to vent for a bit is that ok?
I almost envy asexual people
Its annoying for me because i am trying to get myself to stop thinking or caring about it but every time i get close to actually feeling content with myself these people make me feel like a loser
But even when im with my friends who are also minors they wont talk about any actual hobbies they have
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

Nowadays I've matured significantly since then and have actually solid values, but some didn't get the chance to change like that.
I wanna go into a bit of a personal story here. When I was younger, the time I could spend playing video games was significantly limited by my mother, who was a feminist (Not that either of those things have any correlation). When I was like 12-13 and started getting recommended anti-SJW youtube videos, a lot of then involved feminists who wanted to change video games in ways that in retrospect didn't really matter but were sensationalized by these youtubers. It tapped into that protective part of my brain. I'm not saying that's exactly what happens with weebs, it may be more related to society at whole or experiences with bullying, or for some may be totally unrelated, but I just thought it might be worth noting.
To get back to youtubers, I dont know if Hero Hei or Rev Says Desu or any of these other youtube dipshits actually care about this bullshit. I have a feeling they have an audience they know will eat that shit up and give them money and attention, and just keep shitting it out regardless of whether they care or not. Not to defend them, I just think the question here is of the people who watch that kind of content.
i'm always planning everything
also it feels weird because people never invite me to hang out
i dont have a friend group IRL
thats how it is for me rn
Again maybe I just need to wait until I'm an adult and I'm involved in adult social circles IRL
I don't believe it's wrong that some people prefer to have online friends
For me the question isn't really "are online friendships bad" (no brainer, they're good), it's more "are online friendships replacing real life friendship on a mass scale and is this a good or bad thing?"
alright. i guess im biased because im in high school where most people are still socially awkward.
probably because of the pandemic, but still
im gonna be honest i havent met a single person who self-identifies as an extrovert other than me in like, a very long time
it might sound like the answer the the question is obviously "yes it's bad" but the fact that there doesn't really seem to be any pushback to it interests me a lot
i have been thinking a lot about the fact that nowadays more and more people are just going full online. more and more people are severely introverted, have few or no IRL friends, and spend most of their time inside and online. especially because of the coronavirus. and the question for me is, is this a good thing or not? do I accept it?
Can I talk about some weird shit?
Will add that the United States greatly exasperated the spread of the virus by making it a massively partisan issue.
all he really did was encourage them to vote. canvasing requires some kind of organized effort.
also vaush has said and done some really <:MonkaS:823754078362009612> shit
i dont like him and a lot of other online political figures because they push their followers into being complacent and just watching youtube instead of doing any actual direct action
that guy is pretty much a cult leader
i'd advise not taking political tips from vaush
<:FrankCringe:702606383509405735>
yeah i dont wanna watch 4 hours of idiots yelling at each other over entirely meaningless bullshit
also admitted rapist
pick up artist
i dont wanna stop viewing myself as a failure. i want to succeed
Its not mental health at this point I'm just straight up a failure
how do i stop being such a fucking failure at everything
i wish i could run away from home
i never solve my problems i just temporarily convince myself that they aren't problems
i wish there was a way that i could just completely change my life and throw myself into someone else's body. i hate my life so much.
im tired of having people tell me i'm not a failure i just wish someone would tell me how to change my life so I don't live like this
i dont like a lot of breadtube because they disincentivise people against authoritarian left ideas which i feel are sort of unfairly demonized. i feel like there's validity to both more "libertarian left" ideas and authoritarian ones (i myself lean more authoritarian left)
having autism is scary because you literally just have no idea if you're some delusional loser manchild and everyone only ever does nice things for you out of pity
or if people think you're a delusional loser manchild even if you arent because of it
people like chris chan freak me out because i don't know if my mind is so fucked that i have no self awareness of how lost I am
because if i'm that fucked i'll never know
i love ableist attitudes being so hard-baked into society that they cause more anxiety over autism for me than actually having autism does
I've gotten more and more inactive over time but whenever I want to talk to people about anime or toku or other nerd stuff it's always been pretty welcoming
At least 3 years at this point
I've been here for like
I dont even care about if it actually makes you a pedo or not im just bigoted against anyone who willingly consumes child porn
went to a fun fair, saw a lot of friend groups, realized i dont have to live like this
LECTRIC UPDATE: I've decided that once I find my group IRL (ASAP) this discord account will become almost entirely inactive. Something happened today and I just don't wanna be someone who spends their days on Discord.
yeah but it still feels wrong to sexualize them
it feels really weird and uncomfortable to just sexualize random women.
earlier i was in a discord server talking about a movie and someone said something along the lines of "that actress is really hot though", and i got like really really uncomfortable. Is that weird or am I in the right here?
i kinda wanna rant about this but im not sure where to:
as many of you know, i am pretty strongly leftist. that said, I've been struggling with what kind of leftist beliefs i have lately, which some of you may have noticed. I've been part of an online friendgroup of various people. They're almost all extreme and often authoritarian left. Some of them do things like defend China or the USSR, and some of them watch youtubers like Infrared and BadEmpanada. That said, I don't think most of them are bad people, and many of them are really nice, funny, and awesome fellas. I really love hanging out with them, and even when we disagree i think we generally share the same overall ideals. But as I've been hanging out with them I've kinda been in conflict over whether I actually do share their more authoritarian and extreme beliefs or whether i'm a little less left than they are. I think some of you may have gone through this and I want some advice here.
I think I avoid that because I had bad experiences watching anime on the bus in the past lmao
Shave like 2 hours off for commute
I'm not quite there yet but that's my schedule
What should I do when I feel overworked? For the first two months of school I'm gonna have to leave for school at 7:30 AM and I'm gonna get home by like 8:00 PM
That was a decision based on wanting to switch things up
Like rn I'm on the soccer team at my school
I try some totally new shit when this happens
at the most depressed ive been all year. need someone to just tell me how to break the cycle.
Maybe if you've been in a lot of communities that regard you as a bad person, you should do some self reflecting
that's the cycle im talking about
to elaborate more
i spend lots of my free time inside and alone because i genuinely just dont know what else to do. i dont have time in my day to take classes or anything and my friends are all too busy for me all the time and i cant make new friends because school hasnt started yet and i dont have enough time in my day to start a class since school is gonna start in not too long. im not happy spending all my free time inside and alone. it's what's making me depressed.(edited)
if i could just spend a little bit of my time each day outside with other human beings i'd be happy but there's nothing for me to do but sit at my fucking computer all day. i hate it so much.
Oh
How so?
So I guess different cultures
I don't bar dive, partially because I'm not all that interested and partly because I'm also still underage lol
From my experience more women tend to say "tall guys are overrated, I tend to prefer short guys". Again, not a real problem, just what I've noticed
As usual, capitalism is pretty damn unfair
Geez
I thought it'd be like a slight difference
Thousand? It's that much? Damn
And with any height related issue there's also not really any reasonable solution to it
I was gonna point out how some women (and a few men) are more on edge around tall men since being tall is associated in men with masculinity and to some extent aggression and physical strength but it's not a real issue so much as an occasional mild inconvenience.
Nvm the more I think about this it's actually so trivial it's not worth mentioning
This is gonna seem a little odd so I will just preface what I'm about to say with: I'm completely supportive of feminism deconstructing gender roles and what I'm about to say shouldn't contradict any of that.
<@430379754190012426> in today's society being tall isn't all good
Hey can I ask for recommendations for a book that clearly defines the differences between libertarian socialism and authoritarian socialism, preferably without being too biased towards either?
This is batshit insane
Giving up.
idk if theyre all bad people. they just don't care about me that much.
so i need to just figure out how to be happy on my own terms without others before i can be happy with others
<@!263983345669505025>well, ive run out of people to meet pretty much.
and that's why i have to learn to just live on my own
i just am not worth the time of anyone down here.
it's not even one group of people. it's just every single person down in my area.
possibly the first one. i mean, i can fix that, that's part of the reason i wanna keep to myself for a while.
down here, with every single person ive met, you have to schedule weeks, sometimes months in advance, and it's either 
A, 30% of the time, they ignore me when i'm talking/leave me on sent
B, 30%, they tell me they have something going on and are super vague about it
C, 35%, they say they can make it and cancel it last minute
D, we actually do end up hanging out but we hadn't seen each other in so long it's awkward and we don't know what to talk about
might sound like im exaggerating, but a few months ago i went back up to new york to meet with some friends i hadn't talked to in like, years, and i could literally just be like "hey wanna hang out in an hour" and then we were able to hang out that day. it worked out.
no matter how hard i try it always feels like everyone is unusually comitted to avoiding me
anyways, i dont wanna need those things. i just wanna be happy on my own at this point. at least until i move ive given up on making friends.
might seem like mundane things but in my life it's very rare
people hanging out with me, responding to my texts, showing any interest in me
yeah
i feel like a weirdo/loser/creep/etc
like if i havent been validated for a very short period of time i feel like shit
well its more than that, im also just addicted to being validated by others
i want to explain what happened last night
i didnt take my meds yesterady idk why 
i reached this point where i realized im a different person in every social situation im  in
no one knows the real me. i dont think there's a real me. i just act like whatever will get me validation in every situation im in. when im by myself im always just thinking about how other people percieve me. i cant view myself as myself because i dont have a myself anymore. idk what to do. i cant even imagine living for me at all. like, it's a completely alien concept to my mind. i don't really have anything else to do at this point but give up on life. don't know who i am. if anyone knows what im talking about and can tell me how to turn this around please god do i dont know what else to do but just give up anymore
Meditating kinda keeps me alive because it keeps me in touch with the deep euphoria of being alive that I have. The complexity of daily life sometimes makes me forget that childlike feeling of just living within a day.
I say this because you say that existing and living and feeling makes you tired, it seems
<@170641480791228417> this is a cliche thing to ask, I know, but have you ever done meditation?
Bro rlly made off
Jesus there's so much groomer behavior normalized in certain circles online it bothers me so much
well yeah but i cant just constantly feel this existential dread for the next 8 or so months
there's nothing to focus on but the internet for me because i dont have an IRL social space.
anyways ive tried plenty and i cant find a single way to meet people IRL myself aside from school, and people at my school hate me for unknown reasons. so i'm kinda screwed.
well yeah but i haven't met a single happy person online.
i dont think that's a bad thing
i just feel this huge existential dread. world around me just feels so still and lifeless. it feels like the pandemic moved everything online and it's gonna stay that way (i live in one of the more covid-less areas of the country where things are starting to open up). i don't feel ok with this as i kinda hate the internet and if i could i would delete my entire offline presence, but that isnt really feasible in the modern day and i also feel like i can't meet people like me IRL. 
it feels kinda cringey to say i feel like i was born in the wrong generation, but i really wish i could have lived in a time before this sort of blending together of all of human culture and interaction. i don't think i'll ever really have a place in human society, my brain's too fucked, but at least back then, other people like me would have the need to look for each other and depend on each other. But nowadays evereyone like that turned into a terminally online chatroom regular. i don't wanna live like that.
people seem to think theres this disconnect between "introverts" who prefer online communication and "extroverts" who prefer to hang out IRL but nowadays I don't think "extroverts" even really exist anymore. like yeah people hang out with one another IRL still but things that happen in your own life aren't the focal point anymore, everything's centered around the internet, even if it takes place in real life. which sucks because this way of existance feels like the equivalent of just eating sand all day. it fucking sucks.
and sure, people wish it isnt like that, but to pull off bringing IRL life back into existence would require people to depend on each other. which in the modern age where everyone is mostly dependant on technology, that can't happen. bottom line is, i just cant accept this new reality.
Because even if you could prolong it forever, the break would become hellish eventually
Sometimes you gotta take breaks from that shit, but sometimes you also gotta just face it head on
Well my point is that if no one was mean life would have significantly less depth.
Are you familiar with "white torture"?
But in the right doses it can be sort of healthy for you, as weird as it sounds
Not that I try to start it or anything obviously
<@226789636989517824> if everyone was just nice (which could never happen. Meanness isn't a gene that you can eugenicize) the world would be really fucking boring honestly. Interpersonal conflict is one aspect of meaning in life for me.
A huge chunk of lefties aren't so much advocates for the rights of marginalized people so much as they just mindlessly attack the right for optical shit without actually bothering to analyze why the right is bad in the first place, and do no further education/activism past this.
>fallout pfp
Anyone else with some kind of mental disorder find themselves constantly blaming it for everything that goes wrong?
That's honestly kinda scary
can anyone educate me a bit on the ethics of hunting?
It's generally harder to meet people though if 
A. You live in a small town with  no groups for stuff you're interested in or even worse has a culture of bigotry against you.
B. You have more passive interests than active interests, which I see being common on the internet.
A couple of weeks ago I started hanging out with this one group from a grade below mine and now I feel like I click more with these people than almost anyone I've met in my area in the 2 years I've lived here.
I tried to break into it, and the people there were chill with me and I was chill with them but for some reason I just couldn't click with them. Felt very isolated from them. It definitely wasn't fun.
I go to a small private school and my grade is pretty much just one big group.
It's ok to just leave in either situation. I've had to do it sometimes.
And sometimes people abjectly don't like you.
A lot of the time it's not even that anyone dislike each other. It's that sometimes for really really complicated reasons you just don't click with a group of people, and honestly that's ok.
It really sucks when you don't belong in a social environment especially if you're forced to be there.
Does anyone here know anything about U.S. Law? If you are in another state and break the law of the state you have residency in but what you did wasn't illegal in the state you were currently physically in, do you get tried or not?
i guess we can do stuff for a month. better than nothing.
i looked this up earlier
juliet clauses dont apply in the state he lives in unless you're both underage
ohhh
p much me and this one guy have been wanting to casually date. we both live not far from the borders of our respective states. we're both 17 but he's turning 18 in a month and i'm not gonna be 18 until summer next year. in the state he lives in that's illegal for some reason but where i live it's not. i was basically wondering if we were gonna do stuff where i live could he get in trouble for that in his own state but idk who'd even give a shit tbh
tbh on the off chance that what i'm asking about is somehow illegal it wont affect anyone and no one will no of it, much less prosecute me for it. so yeah, im probably ok
i just needed to get that out
lots of people act so defensive around me. ive been called scary or intimidating several times. but i'm also apparently really chill to be around, my friends will always describe me as the chill one, which means i have literally no way to make myself not look scary
i fucking hate being tall
this isnt too serious but
Idk
AKA told them to go eat shit and die
I did the proper and high road thing to do in this situation
Earlier on Twitter I saw an NFT of MF DOOM, a rapper who died last year
literal modern slavery

are there tentacles?
is this a hentai

oh
i guess that was a rehtorical question
collosal titan or the giant rei thing from end of evangelion
who would win in a fight dya think
i have a serious question
please don't laugh at me
why does everyone like ssss gridman?
it really wasnt bad at all
idk what was wrong with me before
so i watched the first episode of gridman again
ill watch it again
idk
i remember a ton of frame skipping
i remember it being shit
i was watching it and me and my friends were laughing at the animation
maybe i missed something
did you see the cg
tf are you talking about
the animation was garbage
no
is it a good anime or
i think imma watch paranoia agent after i finish flcl
what is this about?
nice
Dragon Maid is probably my favorite slice of life anime ever
i will be SO happy if this is real
hmmmmmmmmm
I havent seen the new SH and PN episodes
jesus i need to keep up with my seasonals
lol the fucking CGI colossal titan
The memes have ruined senko san for me
who is then
also Giorno is easily the most boring JoJo
"Instead of a fair fight between the main hero and main villain, lets just have them chase an arrow around in different bodies until the hero gets it, giving him the most overpowered Stand in the series and allowing him to instantly destroy the villain"
the ending to jojo part 5 was awful
I'm enjoying it a lot
I started it
what should i read next
I'd give it like a 7.5/10
But as it went on I got a lot more invested with the characters and I enjoyed it a lot more
Nasa felt too perfect and flawless a character, and Tsuakasa just felt boring to me
It was a rough start for me as I disliked both of the main characters at first
Ok I caught up with Tonikaku Kawaii
<@!98541382393688064> Im already reading Tonikaku Kawaii and loving it thus far
added all 3 to my to-read list
ok
hmm
any slice of life manga reccomendations? preferably without an anime adaptation
thx
i need a new SoL manga
but it doesnt make the ending any better
well yeah
i disagree tho
I mean thats a fair argument
i think
yeah thats most people
i have not read all of part 6 or any of part 7 and 8 yet tho
part 2 is tied at second with 3 for me
change my mind
part 4 is the best jojo part
doesnt mean its particularly good
stardust crusaders on the other hand doesnt require much context
<@284390402210136064>  part 2 is good but its not the best place to start as it requires a bit of context from part 1
As long as you watch the other parts at some point if you end up enjoying it
theres nothing wrong with starting JoJo at part 3
I thought houseki was ok
~~gridman isnt good but thats my opinion~~
oh no
Jesus that translation is gold
You ok reatard? I am wood. Stoopid.
I broken his right hand
What? Bitch? Must be her brain broken. Fuck.
I AM THE FUCKING STRONG
Alright
I sure ain't picking up a dull action show
Next season I'm considering picking up a show or two but thats a big maybe
I mean really I don't watch anime anymore
Eh I'm here
There's exactly one manga that I am reading for a cute character (Uzaki)
So what I would do is I would use Handbrake to convert the files to 240p and then strain my eyes to see the subtitles
My only technology was a tiny iPod Nano and a Mac I could only use for 15 minutes of the day
I had a problem
So when I was 12 and was first watching Symphogear
Wanna hear a funny story
Oh yeah Handbrake
Thx
K I need a wholesome Yuri romcom manga
You're basically the YouTube incarnation of r/animemes, the dullest and most idiotic subreddit

I think I might actually like Gundam unless it's super political
Or in a shelter
Either that or I'll be dead because of nukes
I'm literally gonna be working for water on a dying planet
Politics are the reason my adult life is going to be miserable
I read/watch/play/listen to fiction to escape politics
Yeah nah
I hate political fiction
<@173112001684439040> when I was 12 Vivid was my least favorite anime ever, have fun
It's cute <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yes
Like if someone changed it to R Kelly's face edited onto Pikachu
Yeah I noticed but usually I don't comment on a new pfp unless it's really outrageous
Elitists can be insightful, but you definitely don't have to agree with them
gintama is ending?
If the videos are monetized it's even worse
The titles are god awful
I hate those channels
Not a fan of anything warlike
Naofumi started at like 20, dropped to -50, and worked his way up to like 40 at least
lets say all the others started at 0 and worked their way up to 50
naofumi deserves his own tier
I could cosplay Ogawa if i could control my hair but I think that's pretty easy
I've turned into the annoying hipster at this point haven't I
Honestly I hope NGNL gets a season 2, not because I like the show, given that it seems to involve incest I have a negative opinion on it, but I just want the anime community to shut the fuck up about it and that seems to be the only way
nGnL sEaSoN 2 sAdJeRk
What manga
what does that even say
eh i thought the anime was pretty unremarkeable
(is it weird that i unironically think that ishigami is slightly cute in his own way)
oh
nah ecchi can be good at specific times
hmm
is to love ru good or shit
(the artstyle and animation at least)
they're both good, they're just different
this was also announced at some point
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1205673330126123009
also I'm gonna watch gridman Now
<@188714906143424513> yeah basically
what y'all gonna watch
https://i.redd.it/rtkg8buoio541.jpg
also I want to say that there are moments where the animation does look kind of charming in its own way. but sometimes it... doesn't
but I still love it for what it is
maybe it would have been a better 3 season show
I love both seasons but yeah the second one is a little better
(in my opinion)
also, it's gory but not really "edgy"
if you can get past the grislyness and the lackluster animation you'll probably get a lot out of it
it's extremely good
Higurashi
THERE'S GONNA BE SOME NEW INSTALLMENT OF MY FAVORITE ANIME?
WAIT HOLD THE FUCKING PHONE
honestly at this point isekai has just turned into an instant turnoff for me (apart from some shows like Shield Hero)
you mean in a theater or in general?
waifutuber
tbh personally I think Astolfo is a he but I wouldn't get mad at someone for calling him a she anymore
```Japan from a legal standpoint sees genitals as determining one's gender, which is stricter than much of the world and is notably stricter than the standard that trans people (and their medical professionals) ordinarily apply.  If someone's ability to be a gender identity is constrained by legal/cultural standards, some people (particularly trans people) would reasonably chafe against that. 
Again, this isn't to stop people from using "he."  It's just providing a rationale that can reasonably justify other pronouns.```
Mostly having to do with how Japan views gender.
I remember someone had a convincing argument that Astolfo could be interpreted as either male or female. I'd have to find it tho.
ik
(a tangent off the earlier Ferris convo) tbh with characters like Astolfo and Hideri i feel like, I interpret them as male but I can't fault others for interpreting them as female or genderfluid or etc. (although Ferris is definitely a girl)
||(aka my pfp)||

I gotta catch up with the manga, I haven't read manga in a while lol and I'm behind on so many things
YOOOOOOOO
<@486087033652248576> YO
his sense of humor is really unfunny IMO
like his video on "trash" anime
gigguk is just if animemes was a YouTube channel although unlike animemes every once in a while he has something good to say
tell me what you are interested in
indeed
me
<@202444817043685386> you ever want music reccomendations you know who to talk to
i gotta reread bleach sometime in the near future
for example, Kaguya
mostly because a lot of anime these days panders to fanservice-loving r/animemes-subscriber waifuists
If I ever get back into anime I'm gonna watch stuff that's from the 90s and 80s and maybe early 2000s
<@!226789636989517824> „Çπ„Éë„Ç≤„ÉÉ„ÉÜ„Ç£!
is Uresai Yatsura worth 195 episodes?
That's unfortunate.
does it matter?
at the moment
but that's like 90% of anime
I'm not saying anime that use exessive fanservice and waifus shouldn't exist
i wish more anime were like AoT and didn't use exessive fanservice and waifus and took themselves more seriously
I'm gonna hate it but it isn't that long, I could probably get through it in 2 or 3 days
I'm probably gonna end up watching Konosuba again
2) These visuals give you just enough to make you wonder what they mean and their place in the story while still being fascinating.
1) The song itself is great. It kind of sounds like a My Bloody Valentine song, but even without the visuals there's something so weirdly unsettling about it.
so yeah this honestly might be my favorite anime ED ever
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rbfHY8mkhT8
ihni
just giving my input on one thing
<#448263431426932738>
idk im not in the vc

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bNITQR4Uso
lofi and future funk are often accosiated with anime
i mean you were all listening to anime and Kamen Rider OPs
really the only non weeb music i listen to is gorillaz and vaporwave. not counting lofi and future funk because i consider them weeb genres
for some odd reason no one hear likes non-weeb music (jk i dont care)
(jk im not totally fufilled in life just in this vc)
ill leave bcause satisfied
im fufilled
ok
oh
oh

Meddle might actually be my second favorite Pink Floyd album
the hard part is sitting thru 105 anime openings
those challenges are super easy for people who dont care about singing or dancing
igonre everything i said, it sounds great
wait nvm i had the track playing from discord and soundcloud at the same time lol
the sounds and melodies were really good tho
<@!193408538909868033> good idea but feels a little bit rough around the edges. Mixing might need to be looked at a little, the drum beat didnt always feel completely in time as well
<@!193408538909868033> I liked it for the most part, but one thing I wasn't a fan of was the electric guitar sound. Honestly I would just replace that with a bass synth (303 maybe?). Otherwise good melody tho.
My signal isn't great here and every track takes forever to load and I'm close to home anyways
I'll check it out when I get home

wondering how you would think of this one

yeah
they seem interesting, i guess i would classify them as breakbeat?
yeah ive heard some songs of theirs
check out Radiohead - In Rainbows
if you like coldplay
<@!472513526393602059>
its pretty alright. I'd say that i felt like it was a little sparse. Maybe some more dominant mid range sounds and/or some reverb could to it good.

<@!102691114762371072> weezer
<@456226577798135808> yeah. I highly reccomend Aphex Twin and the Tubular Bells album. All great stuff.
the PLETHORA of stands named after Pink Floyd in some form, Schottkey 1 and 2 (Schottkey Path 7 is the name of an Aphex Twin song), Weather Report, Tubular Bells, Earth Wind And Fire, and King Crimson,
I don't think I've ever taken specific music references from JoJo but I often pick up on ones that I really like
or idk how to put it
<@193408538909868033> fairly good, my only complaint is that the synth playing chords sounds a bit flat
reminds me of the train bits in eva
I do love music
oh no! again?
yeah I guess

they used to be my favorite band
oh nice new Gorillaz song
I'm puzzled as to why
it seems like Shirabe is afraid of me tho lol
genuinely one of the most surreal and somewhat nightmarish pop songs I've ever heard
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=CqHKfscXS64
thank you!
the entire song does actually
it sounds a lot better here
it sounds kinda loud and crunchy compared to the rest of the track
its a synth
the one that starts around 30 seconds in
the melodies themselves are pretty good but it sounds a little off
also this one key sound sounds not well mixed IMO
tbh. this piano sounds a little cheap and the pad could have been more prominent
on it
It's very good! Although I myself would have given the guitar more mid-range frequencies. But the melodies are great. <@!193408538909868033>
thanks!
<@!193408538909868033> can you give me some constructive criticism on this?

yes
ye
for reference
this is the song that inspired the one I'm working on rn
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GBzJO895usc
the bass and kick drum just kinda seem to blend together
thanks
yeah
the bass and kick drum sound off to me
what should I do to fix this?

<@!193408538909868033> need some advice on a mix
I can link you the server if you want
for streaming I use Amazon Music because I have to leech from my parents lol.
generally when I'm looking for reccomendations on music I either ask people in a music server I'm in, or I use RateYourMusic's chart system (both the popular and esoteric charts)
(pun not intended)
this is immensely cheesy and i love it to death
