lol
i put up a carol and body if anyone wants
i can host some too
thanks for the carry <:KanonLove:597703275848007680>
probably unkilled is what they meant
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
seeing this is pretty tragic though
i put some bosses up too
<a:AyaPeek:626304083548045323>
it just stopped showing them <:eve:601322405629132806>
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
cluttering up the list that is
out of curiosity does that actually matter or is it just annoying
red carol/body
i put up some bosses if people want to tag
that sounds tragic
<:eve:601322405629132806>
oh same actually
nn
<:AyaDed:432993129642328074>
<:satanialaugh:322185769189900289>
you're right, 3.0
wait
time for sheet 2.0 <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
<:ArisaSleep:626469313108508672>
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
very powerful clap
am i reading that right as atsui inu <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
<:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
i posted a dragon and both carols if anyone wants to tag them
ah k
i have both up as well in case you guys want them, but if not then <:YukinaShrug:585567198995677204>
back to work for me, gl with drops
i think you have to be mutual friends for it to show up before the 3 hour mark
body, dex, tech?
its from half of the elements iirc
29 red carols <:eve:601322405629132806>
i have carols up, though i think a number of people tagged my green carol already
nice
you do
so you just need 1 dmg and then you can retreat <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
gives you participation
doing damage
nice crystals
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
F
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
oh are you guys coordinating for last hits
didn't even do 4k <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
basically a leech
honestly i don't really do much damage so the best i can do is host stuff
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
anyone want any bosses? i can host whatever
grats on your new shiny LU'd card

dex in case someone needs
and then use rice if the ones you need pop up and you don't have stam
you might as well leech what you can get right now lol
probably yeah lol
whenever that is <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
well, at least until everyone does like a third of the bar in one attempt
so what you're saying is people should always pick public <:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
<:eve:601322405629132806>
i heard ones that are friends/followers only become public automatically after a while
might be sub 3 hours actually
i think it needs to be 3 hours or less to be visible publically
there's this one as well
yeah i got mine with spice's ignite biki <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
i'm short a giga red power and giga melody for the second LU on the free chris
just shy <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>

i almost broke 150k with no mlb'd 5*s and it as an assist
yeah ignite biki is pretty ridiculous
oh could you make some room quartz?
<:KanonLove:597703275848007680>
oh you guys cleared mine, thanks
<a:EvePunch:625501089655160862>
just like me<a:TsuguNoMoney:621497902451130389>
<:kokoroitunes:590786502397657109>
the other option is
<a:deskslam:522267950569357322>
nice
i generally just put a few up at a time in case people decide to pile on it
nice got a giga red <:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
time for <:EveBless:598401700117610530>
i need one giga red and one giga melody for my welfare chris
time to star
thanks
<:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
<:ShirabeCheer:671887003414954005>
oh 9.8 would you mind making room? if it's too much of a bother no worries
<:AyaDed:432993129642328074>
they do
lol
red-orange
yeah orange
oh rip
i'm still paused too
did anyone go?
go on 10 now, got it
oh is it time
i'll be here for the rest
xeno was 12 -> 11 iirc
give it like 10 seconds?
red/blue
11 <:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
oh
i'm in for both
k
we at 10 still?
oh are we up to 11
thanks <:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
alright
oh k
20s call?
10 <:eve:601322405629132806>
in case someone does

dunno if anyone needs these, but
oh lol
tech raids huh
ugh that doesn't show up well

you can check the materials each boss drops
generally you'll want to use more to secure either a last hit or a higher level of contribution
5cp = 2x and 10cp = 3x
it's for more damage
gl hope you don't have to <a:TsuguMoney:626303605837660160> even harder
<:chrissurprised:640435644430155776>
i doubt i'm full, but in case i am lmk
^
i put up carols in case someone wants to carr- i mean hit them
it's relatively hard to mess up
i'm down for whatever
prob do a second round of reacts?
you just need to follow
but i highly doubt that
and next time it happens you get banned
at worst that means they'll give you a "final warning"
yeah, remember this is very sketchy stuff <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
oh nice
chaos approaches
when everyone has reacted (however many people that is) then you unpause
and react to his message when you're in
you join and pause immediately
basically follow sanic and they're gonna spawn 1hp raids and let us know the type in chat
i can do a quick explanation
oh is it almost time for sanic runs
back to 19 i think
we're at 19
make sure you unfollow if you aren't in
try to keep chat clean until we're done if you can
currently we're unpausing at 17 still (17 means everyone is in and paused)
if you're joining and weren't in the previous headcount say something
just get in the next one shocker
we're unpausing at 17
16 final call it looks like
15*
we're at 13 currently
because you have a lot of time to pause
cya wayfarer
it's easier to keep track <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
yeah as soon as you see 18 reacts you can go
he's got the pasta
where's our straggler at
k we're def 19
lmao
wrong message <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
with wayfarer it's 19 i think?
body
18
17 unless anyone is joining back in (idk if wayfarer's in)
yeah
body and tech next i think it was?
<a:TsuguMoney:626303605837660160>
we're at 18 for int it looks like
17 it is
aka dex
miracle carol
üçõ
thanks sanic
i'm done too
lol
18 now
lmao
guess we're at 18
unpause guys
whelp
so people already had leveled up cards
they also released raids about a year after release or so i heard
with 40+ other people
so basically we all join what ever coloured letter hard raid agehao starts. then we pause as soon as we join..... we un pause after someone says go or we reach the maximum emote
pasta:
disclaimer they'll be hacked raids where the boss is going to be set to 1hp
alright
so are you restarting in an hourish?
<:YukinaShrug:585567198995677204>
huh k i think that's everyone
thal are you in?
rip EU
if not it might be best to regroup in an hour or something idk if more people will show up
green carol for anyone joining
oh thanks for the heads up
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
inb4 no one's alive
let's get a head count i guess
oh boy
raids are meant to have a lot of people
headcount on this i guess
so basically we all join what ever coloured letter hard raid ahegao starts.     then we pause as soon as we join..... we un pause after someone says go or we reach the maximum emote
i have the pasta still
that's 9
unpause if you haven't already
we hit 10
nvm
-polk so i think we're at 9
i was confused since it also took a while to come up for me
red carol
or red carol
oh normal reds?
people want them mats
yeah wayfarer
wait like a minute for the 10th
looks like we're at 9 (ignoring 9.8)
oh is it time
next one is up if you didn't refresh already
cya wayfarer
looks like we're at 8
headcount for heart on this
on a new atrribute (or we can just headcount every attribute)
and then say something when you're joining
and not if you aren't
the most consistent way is to react on headcounts when you're gonna do the upcoming attribute
oh, alright
got a straggler
9 it is
headcount on this
body
B
do the rare ones so pink for 9.8
we finished carols already
it's supposed to be a long-term upgrade so them being rare is intended i assume
unpause on 11
everyone does 1 damage
should be 11, but you should cut it off, ahegao, if it takes too long
<:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
thanks for the runs, i'm done for today
gonna stop after the next power
power/int/...?
what do we have left
what's our next attribute
soon i'm going to resort to LUing the aot chris welfare
all these mats and nothing to use them on
because she loses her pierce
don't you not want to LU FM chris?
there we go
gl
kk
are you stopping after the carols? sorry if i missed it
^ crashed
last one was 5, i'm in now so 6?
what are we on?
forgot to check
oh i'm dumb
hi
i'll be around prob
<:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
thanks for the runs
yeah
oh gotta go after this one
dang
unpause i guess
<:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
did someone besides accelerate leave?
ah
shouldnt you just be able to search his id
theyre gonna clean all of us and then itll be a free for all <:Ver:336656981144109066>
prob intended the 4 to be for both
in the screen that lets you host them
you can check the drops of each raid
thanks for the carry cais
yes, just isekai the bosses
i have carols up in case someone would like to carr- i mean help me out
need carols and int for my upcoming x drive biki <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>

<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
don't forget to press the button
yeah
we're still on 7
lucky's in it looks like
sure we can count ^
i assume everyone's staying for red carols
<:okhand:322185741306429450>
g
waiting on melua i think
it's hacked
if it's followers only it should be fine prob
on the react
don't forget to pause until we hit 7
melua's 6
zero would be 7
count is now 6
k
our count is... 5
thanks accel
which one first sorry
nice
didn't notice you joined in
mujtabaa killed already
taka are you in

5 miracles, i'll take it
i'm still refreshing
please read
i need miracles too
rip two carols
sigh
i don't see it
so basically we all join what ever coloured letter hard raid onii-chan starts. then we pause as soon as we join..... we un pause after someone says go or we reach the maximum emote
does someone in here not know how this works?
green carols first?
i'm up for that

also this one but i haven't jumped in it yet
i didn't find any red carols <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
oh that was just in general

looks like melua's carol is being worked on, both adds still up
or whoever's in there
feel free to @ me
destiny, could you let me know when the adds on yours are dead?
but i can help with yours after the adds are dead with my other account it's only like 200k damage in total though
i just put up a green carol on my new account as well

both adds down
we're at 8 with haz
i think haz made it in cause he reacted
haz is in for 8?
we're at 7
i mean doesn't he still have follower slots
power, int, dex, heart
we're on tech though
it's not too late
no
5 it is
head count for tech
k

we're at 6 because two people weren't in the headcount
they also aren't part of the carols
sounds good to me
headcount for body bosses
let's do body next then
what color do people want
k 6 for the last red carol then
ah k there
karu i think?
host -> set to 1 hp -> everyone else goes in
idk how suspicious you'd rate that
and then you use those <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
we could just have someone in here host
headcount for red carols
F
nice i got my miracles
10 years for refresh
also my b karu i thought you killed the second one too cause i couldn't see it
i'm the last person right?

go on 8
oh i need to stop
F
don't think shocker is so go on 9
go i guess
unless shocker is in
think we're at 9 for power
does anyone even need dex/heart?
power/dex/heart left
we're on 10 guys
headcount for int?
on both sides
it's two tildas
int's prob harder currently
power/int i think?
gogo
guess not
you joining?

<:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
lol
must've misclicked <:YukinaShrug:585567198995677204>
k nice

they only care about leaderboards i think
head count for tech
oh tech next?
headcount for red carols
i'm in so 8 i guess
oh it's time huh
thanks for the train <:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
looks like 9 for red carols
i included the previous head count lmao
oh i'm dumb and miscounted
k head count for red carols
head count for heart
alright
yeah
or did you already do those
are we doing red carols?
jesus that's a lot of giga fantasy crystals
head count for body
yeah
i don't do enough damage so
almost joined that on accident

slay it
yeah
we're going to 9 on this one
knightofancient hit the headcount without saying anything it looks like
k
sakimori you in the tech yet?
i need to max the welfare kanade so i can consistently do 10% on reds lol
oh didn't see that one and opened my own <:pepega:608529166706671626>
130k <:LisaThink:571224045513867264> not too bad
let's find out how much i can do
got lucky
i got the account from a friend who rerolled a few accounts for each x drive
with just x drive hibiki
5cp keeps giving me 240-300k damage
yeah that's also what i meant, max we can get is 8 from one of these
that's what you get max per giga from participation/last hit/highest damage
yeah each one has a different drop table
got one single 2 and one single 5

i only took one ss
i just got 15 miracles wtf
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
head count for red carols
it's time
sakimori asking the important questions
thanks for raids <:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
i think i'm good for today
feels rng lol
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
f2p+
did you solo that <:eve:601322405629132806>
in case anyone needs
alright it's up
it'll be a bit though just started
i'm putting one up currently
in case anyone's interested

<:worrywave:585558568217083914>
weekends maybe
thanks <:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
kk
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
i'm just joining for rarer mats
haz/kazusa do you guys need anything
kk
if someone got banned they would've said something prob
ah k
if you want in you gotta say something
i mean we're at 4
4 it is
anyone else for body? if not we're going to go
oh we didn't head count
it's time
i think we're good to unpause
oh karu makes 6
react on haz' message i think we're at 5
react when you're in
i'm alive
then backing out
haz is taking it to 1k hp
already have you added <:okhand:322185741306429450>
my  brain's been <:pepega:608529166706671626> lately cause of busy season F
that's what you meant by poverty lol
oh i see
i can try and help
last hit is pretty nice
i should've remembered that there were from the auto reacts
well if you feel like it anyways
do you have a bot here? if you do, you could make it a self-assignable role too
maybe it's time for a raid role <:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
got 5 miracles
k nice, thanks haz
i'm here to find out lol
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
make sure you sort by miracle
even if you followed it takes a while sometimes
i think we just wait a few minutes at this point
<:EveBless:598401700117610530>
<:ZoomEyes:573649151129288745>
oh i forgot to say, thanks haz
stocking up on them miracles
thanks
both have no adds
this'll die soon too probably
if anyone wants

hopefully it doesn't fill up that fast <:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
ah it was, i'll follow after i'm out
the one with the english name has adds down
also there are two public miracle carols up that are sub 1m hp right now
oh you don't have follower space, unfortunate
in case anyone manages to snipe in

that said i'm just posting public ones
<@!195566400541032448> made some room
sec

oh it's dead
in case anyone needs

anything under 800k is definitely going to die
just refresh miracles only occasionally
lol
ded

they die pretty fast after i post them most of the time
yeah it's dead
now

<:PharaDab:336657302914596866> is still alive though

this is currently up for anyone who wants


update to the first one
some lowish carols i found


rip
if you can snipe in


carol i posted is ded

will probably be dead soon

nice gigas
nah i didn't have CP so no worries
ded
if you can snipe in

update to jelly's
there's also this one
if anyone wants to jump in to this one, it'll probably die soon
if you can't do 3% with only 5cp, you're better off just tapping bosses once each with 3cp
hunt is last hit
if you can get 3% damage with a single 5cp attempt, then you should do that
but yeah if you want giga melodies, you can also host power bosses and hope people help you in here
hunt/highest damage for killing blow/big damage
contribution is 3/5/10% damage
yeah you'll want to qualify that with health bars because a lot of people refer to attributes with their colors
if you want giga melodies, power bosses are your best bet because a lot of people have int units
especially if it's one of the carols or the regular power boss
generally anything sub 60% or so with at least a few hours on it left is likely to die
and hit things that look like they'll die
yeah without damage you mostly just want to host and hope people kill it

lmao

<:AyaDed:432993129642328074>
when you only have 3 cp

i gave her a bop
in case anyone needs

cais/yamino will probably kill it soon

micha's almost dead
both adds are up though
probably dead soon

if anyone wants to try and snipe this one
good text <:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
basically have one of your raids be cleared
i'm confused at how i got that in my head at this point
excellent
nope i'm just an idiot


just double checking this works or proving i'm an idiot

i'll test it again
i don't think you do need to win
once the duration is up and you "claim," it counts towards the weekly
and then don't open it up to anyone
you can just host a normal raid
or are in a different time zone
if you're staying up
by lacking i mean i have 30 of both but that's less than the others
i'm lacking int and magic the most currently
long term proof
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
dex though
thanks btw haz
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
compared to mine

that's a nice haul
i'm in and paused
tfw you're the one that's short by 17k
never mind it's dead
if anyone wants to try to snipe
only the best hackers can get into the game when it's on maintenance
<:ArisaJii:597706210917220362>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
unless i want to max out 3*s
no units to use them on
oh i missed the train huh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
k i'm just dumb and missed that
do you have a different code <:LisaThink:571224045513867264>
wait
11 i guess?
i didn't click
it's ded
sec
gotta finish burning flames then
oh
hdk's int boss is low
nice i got a potato
because they don't drop with the carols
body/tech are probably the most useful
one more int left
gonna do my pvp match after the ints
slay it
different account
316772532
i killed the carol and wasn't the last person <:Ver:336656981144109066>
oh wow garie's dead
time to double dip
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
i bet they're in spice's carol
we got some stragglers
when you almost join spice's power carol because it's so low
<:ChisatoGun:572664185960529920>
rip
still paused
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
accel are you in? i think you haven't clicked yet
final count is 12 it looks like
earlier one was 7
count is at 7 for power
i usually claim them a set at a time
i'm done
thanks for the raids
kill it
one more tech
i killed already
wait it was at 11 <:eve:601322405629132806>
nice, thanks
can you make room as well so i can favorite you <@!204501539308568577>
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
probably some casualties here from that
k i removed a bunch
sec
both adds down

<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
definitely not

this definitely wasn't close at all

in case someone wants to snipe
girheim's is dead too
just killed it
if you want to snipe a last hit
46k*
i just joined it
iroha's is 60k or so

it happens way too often
you kind of just have to hope you don't get burned that often

<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
not the potato you actually want

looks like two people got it
it's dead
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
if you're fast enough


haz did one of those earlier
yeah
it basically just acts as if your entire team dies right then and there i think
you keep your damage
yeah dead
so i can't check
i'm still inside
micha's down

probably the same for this one
both adds down now
garie's basically dead

contribution is 3/5/10% of the boss' health
participation is just doing anything
top one has micha alive though
in case anyone needs

any of the categories has a chance to give you miracles
literally just ~~rng~~ skill
oh that was 6 hours ago lmao
yeah you can get 150-300k
nice
in case anyone wants

one thing you can do is look for already half dead carols/int raids and then post those

didn't expect to be able to do this now if adds are down
in case anyone's interested


for anyone who needs
it was only like 37k hp
managed to get a last hit
<:ArisaJii:597706210917220362>
it's being hit currently
this will prob die too

also

if you're quick
ah
i'm gonna do advant and then put 3cp into it prob

there's
if you still have stam

ded
i just joined it lol

in case you're able to snipe it

thats right
yeah
red means you're mutuals
lmao
you're probably just better off opening them and then asking people to hit it
those are pretty likely to die
yellow hp that is
there's not much you can do besides that
just try to hit everything that's yellow or lower
too lazy i'll join next time
we need the new mats for alchs/testament i assume
<:pepega:608529166706671626>
oh you're doing runs huh
<:eve:601322405629132806>
oh
i mean besides test
what else do you need fine for
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
i'll go ahead and put some up then
oh k
so i can't check lol
i didn't roll my 10 yet
do you need fine for testament
i can not be lazy and put mine up if you want
lol
i should max testament first k
fate pls
how hard are the bosses
guess i should get around to hitting everything too
plenty of rice in the pvp shop <:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
i need one more saint germain for guaranteed mlb all alchs <:grrrr:311273487799025664>
unless other people want
fine's up hal
also yeah it's faster for sure
<:hinalul:568704213992079360>
my jii got sniped before i could cleanse


i'll put it up soon
also yes she does remove the ko effect
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
rez charms?
which one
yes
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
you really need serena for fine huh
what
also lol instant death, didn't even have time to cleanse it
considering their track record with bandori/revue
that'd be even dumber
putting up the next lion
3 more rolls
k
for WW?
also looks like we aren't getting anymore story
oh a character song
the what now
alright time to roll test i guess
i see
thanks for carry
that's it
god i'm going to need so much exp
it's a good thing i have 200 rice
putting up a lion and fine then
i mean, yeah basically lmao
unfortunate since you need so many mats for alchs
oh i can solo lion lol
yeah
so many fines lol
~~just about~~ dead
<:KasumiXD:585571478699769865>
i'm killing it now
nice timing
time to solo my last lion then
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
i assume it's ded but i'd be in for it
i'm also in
in the middle of a lion currently
uh sure i guess
i'm ready whenever
i'm just dumb then
ah okay
what's your current name
nothing <:AyaDed:432993129642328074>
oh
i apparently might not have you added
wait what was your en code lol
nvm testament died, this'll take another 30 turns
i can just quit out
let me know if you don't want to wait lol

uh
<:kokoroyay:566526499549872128>
i have 4m left lol
need more lions <:AyaDed:432993129642328074>

this was a mistake
tfw i'm still on that same boss
if that's your second
also i managed to get into yours
thanks game
will do
and see if i can do both <:Ver:704169051391524875>
gonna be greedy
oh someone else has one that's lower
k
so close to having 6+ copies of all of them <:AyaDed:432993129642328074>
since she's mlb'd
oh i should probably make my cagliostro leader
gonna macro event stam in the meantime
no worries
kk
testament is quite something lol
also saw you killed mine earlier
i can do half her bar usually as long as the adds are dead
that'd be great
so far away

i prob don't have it either lmao
which acc is this one fate
oh we're going already i'll just quit out
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
give me a few minutes to kill this lion
have plenty of old mats
i'm good
there's a lion gotta get to it quick
i'd definitely take the lions, those are way harder to get since everyone can solo them
oh next is up
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
after this
time to open up my old account to host lions for myself
just 3 for now
