But I wanted to get in here before I forgot to later
Activity might be limited so I can avoid the spoilers until I finish the series lol
And I'm firmly aboard the "Chris is best girl" train
Hello! A friend of mine finally convinced me to watch Symphogear and I got through the first season and now four episodes of the second season and I'm just in love with the show
But I really liked some of the others involved and I'm worried they'll just blindly follow his word
At least he makes the choice obvious
It's like this is what he wanted
Like it was an amicable breakup for about a week and this dude just changes his mind in the night and goes public that she was cheating on him when she wasn't?
But all it takesi s one person being selfish to ruin things
I'll manage and I'm sure it'll work itself out
I made friends with a group through two people who were in a relationship and now they've broken up and it's pretty hostile and I'm gonna have to choose which is a super bummer
