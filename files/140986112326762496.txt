I'ma add it to my list of missed opportunities. No Chris terminator reload. No tsubasa akira slide.
I'm so mad they didn't actually have tsubasa do this at any point in the show. Especially with how many yugioh 's are in that

Tien after image

King kai-spirit bomb/kao ken

goku-????
Not to sound dismissive, but did you watch z?
king kai
krillin
So goku has no techniques he developed on his own
sure
stole = 'a technique developed by another character and then learned'
we've seen like 1 other person use instant transmission so I wouldn't say no one else can use it
thats just two stolen techniques mushed together
Does goku have any of his own actual techniques. Cause i'm feeling like all of his are stolen
and i am sure he could teach the evil containment wave to other people. Goku loves stealing techniques
Yeah, roshi is like moon/planet level. But like.... compared to most other pepole that is still bottom teir

what technique was that? i thought you meant it as the kis word thing since it was right next to each other

i'd almost think that there isn't because whomever tanya was (at least in the anime) doesn't have *time* for that. They are busy trying to win a war and secure their salary man life pipeline
Its come full circle
Who do you think she is? Eddie murphy?
To google i go cauE I dont know what that is
Very out of anime circles. It is really only due to gear that I have gotten back into it. 

Which I only bumped into through ttrpg space
Also whats up with the two sentence elevator pitch as titles?
What is maes hughes doing here?

It was brought up here, and in two other discords I am part of. With a bunch of people saying good things about it I was just like "FINE I"LL WATCH IT!"
on the subject of isekai, Fabiniku, seems good for the first episode that I watched. And the universe is conspiring to make me watch it.
irony of being on the gear server where 90% of problems are setup as cliffhangers and solved the next ep. But gear is crazy
some giant 'world ending monstrocity that some weirdass clowns released'
yeah i remember that thing.
ohhh wait
The part at the school? i think the last arc of the season
it started off that way for me with all the exposition ((although the delete my hardrive joke was good)). But on the podcast discord we were doing a 'group watch' with a bunch of people, and it was slime's turn
Same thing with Slime.

so much expositon in the first 2 eps. The naming thing was a cool idea, but the mc is so op that i just couldn't really care. Watched the first season, cause i binge, then dropped and ignored
Which is a shame, cause I liked some of hte reversal of expectations.

Like Megumin (well i just like megumin) 

Or how the big raid is a bunch of cabbages

or a few other things I can't remember now.

But on a whole, i watched all of the stuff thats out, and then droped it
I feel like it has 1 joke, and just keeps using that same joke
and like, the sunlight/golden hour stuff coming through the window is too much
too much yellow

What if that prequel was starting off with taking woody out of a toybox and starting to reminisce. Cutting back to playing with it as a childhood thing. We're lead to believe that its Andy, but in reality its his father and Woody was passed down from father to son. As the movie ends with woody being given to a like 2/3yo andy
ohhhhhhhhhhh, is your heart ready for this?
It kills me cause they could easily have made a woody movie. (prolly shouldn't just call it woody though). And have it be a western legend that inspired the show which made the toy.

its a consistent through line that makes sense.
It just feels a bit weird to have a person, who has no connection to *earth* but has a toy that is alive because toystory, but was an actual person/hero or whatever
it feels like something that was thought up by souless corporate exectutives
that looked like Chris Renfield, si that resident evil?

Also is that a glove/henshin device or cybernetic/prosthetic?

Fran also reminds me a lot of Kanna.
ep 3 ||I also 100% expect that little adventuring party she saved to come in and save her from the end of the episode. Mostly because they are in the OP, but also because Fran is not super overpowered. She is strong sure, but she isn't most isekai protagonists. Sure she wasn't isekaied here, but that is kidna semantics since she just carries potentially op sword||
fer sure. 

But she is also direct. She straight up wants power. Sure its for this whatever evolution thing that her tribe has never done. But we can also see its a bit more than that. 

She gets shit on for being a 'black cat'. She is trying to hold onto her parents dream or ideals. Which I would not be surprised that their quest for evolution was also to try and improve their tribe's standings.
Fran is the reason I am still interested in sword iskeai.
||Suletta literally falling head over heels from the flick is so good||
||She metnioned number 12 or something I think. About exchanging contact information? ||
||I don't remember class being on her list||
||Could technically be one herself since it was revealed (thankfully wasn't dragged out) that her mom is in charge of one too||
Suletta is such a goober and I love it
I am pretty sure Miomio already is in that tsundere way
As someone who only remembers *shining finger* gundam, and ignored most of the rest of gundam with how internconnected/deep/long it is. I am a fan
OH, I also love how they are playing with zero-g ||That head flick into full body rotation is pretty great||
||I am super down for Gruel's development here. The marriage thing is kinda crazy but fun. I wonder if Suletta is going to collect a bunch of marriage proposals. ||

||Mio-mio is also pretty cute, I wonder if in an episode or two Suletta's going to say it and she won't get mad at the nickname||
||Its kinda fun that the deal of the duel wasn't to get out of the marriage thing, but to make Suletta her fiance again. #goals ||
Yeah. She is almost a different person outside her mech. Which makes some sense.
||neat. I haven‚Äôt watched other gundam but glad to hear it||
Witch-3 ||i also doubt they would come out and say it either way. But seeing it and being able to *suspect* that she is autistic is a good step for awareness.  ||
||I was getting a similar feeling. But wasnt sure if it was more autistic, or her lack of socialization due to backstory. Definitely felt it though just waiting to see which way it went in more episodes ||
||yeah. She may have this tragic past we see in the prologue. But she still tries to keep positive. ||
Witch -3 ||I love Suletta being such a goober when it comes to social stuff. Like when talking with Gruel about 2 forward, she isnt looking at him when explaining her mindset. She cant even bring herself to look at him||
They both have that kind of dead expression to them. With more just under hte surface.

<@399293953171521549>

then you should be fine with the slang
Are you familiar with cyberpunk as the ttrpg or video game?
The dub vs sub is a little *weird* with edgerunners. Some of the slang doesn't get subbed very well.
Tee has started it, and its gooooood <https://youtu.be/_CYjPFBwaWo>. I binged it after watching the first ep with him.
It reminds me of those out of context spoilers, like when people would post pictures of jelly donuts and neopolitan ice cream and it is a spoiler but without context it doens't mean anything.

What do you think is happening there that would make it a spoiler?

I feel like you already know that answer
well they are on 6 of 12 I believe. you'd have a better idea on if/when that would be there
||Which imo is fine. Its nice to see a character that wants power for powers sake occasionally. And sure its because it was part of her parents/tribes goals. So I get that part. But having to rely on others would be a good lesson. Especially when they just picked up the 'kin summon' skill. Which when getting your ass kicked by a big bad demon would have been a good time to summon in the friends they made. ||
||I'ma keep watching for the season at least. But I saw the picture of fran getting her hands hacked off and thought, 'oh shit whats going to happen'. Then it was immediately fixed. Then he got broken, and was immediately fixed. Then, instead of using their cool plan to get at the DM to defeat the OP lvl 30 demon, they just stabbed it in the chest real hard. ||

||And i'm just like... okay. So your just op and nothing matters? Back in ep 3, when we saw that other group Fran saved I was hoping that ep4 would start off with them coming to her aid and becoming a proper adventuring party. But it just feels like its falling into the trash tropes||

gwitch ||`"On board with being suletta's fiance".`  I thought about this back in episode like 2/3. When Mio was all "Suletta will still be my fiance!" as a term of the duel. Where instead of that she could have set the terms to get out of the marriage thing isntead. So clearly <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868> ||
||This is part of my thinking. that the 21yr is the whole of the prologue event. Like back when that project started||
> Bocchi the rock

Just started this since I have seen a bunch of people mentioning it. As of episode 2 ||Ryo the blue haired girl is best girl via strong Daria energy||
did you watch any of the rest of it?
Do we have any idea how many episodes its supposed to he in total?
||for sure. But for example on the 21years thing, the whole program could have been started 21 years from that date. So she was just refrencing the whole project, and getting revenge for all of it. And then there is the whole 'trust my daughter' thing, and to who she was referign too. And there is just so many things||
gwitch stuff 

||We are kinda jumping at some stuff based on other vaguely defined stuff. The 21 years of revenge, could be based off a different event. The aerial thing could be  clever writing. Suletta could be Eri, just with a name change for her protection. Especially given as she was 4 way back then. Easy to change a kid's ideas on stuff. ||

or well I could just huffing some kind of ium
Bocchi the Rock is also good sol
Elma low key best girl
Ms Kobayashi‚Äôs dragon maid
and bocchi is probably horrified at the idea of it
I don't think miorine was even on the list as of last week
needs more volume
yeah. And I feel like I've gotten new perspective on other people who have to deal with that kind of social anxiety irl
the "not real' animation stuff bocchi does is fun
or well, people who have proposed to her
one of her fiance's
Few things are as artistic
and I really like their interaction in this scene
Ryo is best girl

So many black bars. Gotta watch the ep today
Miku in geah being best waifu previously
It was a few ships, and she was mostly mindcontrolled when that happened.

And well, did you watch the ep?
gwitch 7

||I'm sorry Miku, you have been dethroned as best waifu. Miorine now. Holy shit girl put it allllllllll on the line for her fiance||
I had kinda assumed that it was just a translation/culture thing but felt I should check
üëç
Also as someone who's not well versed in japanese at all. Is "That Girl" a translation/cultural thing? It feels like a weird way of saying "her" or some other way of refering to each other.
Its a curious situation on the highest surface level. Because back when Miorine made Suletta duel for her back in ep 2/3 she could have used it to get out of the marriage thing.

Instead, she just made it so she would stay engaged to Suletta.....
She has taken the title of Best Wife, from nearly every other wife in anime
I was wondering if the creator ‚Äúknew‚Äù but I get the feeling with the ending, that they did
soooo good
did you finish the episode?
I am sure that we are all about to be slammed with horrible gundam storyline/themes stuff. Likeya know corporate funded war and the like
Its good
Also Miomio is best wife
Shaddiq went up a few steps imo in that ep
||Not only "i will protect you", but "I'm gonna sacrifice parts of myself to protect you"||
||https://preview.redd.it/miorine-after-creating-a-kickstarter-and-beating-all-goals-v0-h9pdpkwbeb1a1.png?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=6612f29a2b06018cb9020b9ffe0f67a3dae019a3||
Suletta is like TurboSub. She need Miorine to tell her what to do and she will do
https://twitter.com/gutalalaman/status/1594503527275036672?s=20&t=ZqxwldfclcferlkspA3fHQ
Yeah. I am curious to see where it goes. 

I am also curious to see how the Suletta/Moirine goes. Mio is making some moves, and clearly considers Suletta a friend. But more than a friend? haven't seen much of that. But its also possible she never considered anything except a political marriage in her life for a while.

And Suletta is just a goober. A goober who is prolly heading to some dark shit if you have read any of the theories

> bocchi 7

||Bruh, Bocchi popping the balloons is so sad||

I would 100% get a kessoku band shirt
Went looking for some Bocchi merch, And the stands on amiami where the other girls are in some light (ish) envrioments, but Bocchi's is in teh darkness, just hits different
||I was not prepared for the feels from this episode. Drunk-chan is a real one. I hope she gets over her drinking through the girls. And the feels from the manager sister who probably gave up her band to take care of Niji got me with some real Lilo and Stich vibes.||
Just started bocchi 8

||Bro, i got hit with such a feel as drunk girl shows up for her||
||Yeah i was kinda hoping that since he hadn't taken a shot yet, that he would be a sorta 3rd party faction representative. not directly after Suletta/aerial, but still messing with both other sides||
||yeah, that *could* be a thing, but I don't get the vibe that Ryo would be into anyone else romantically. And they are all lke 15 right? not something we need to force||
||Well, maybe managerXgoth girlfriend who is also there at th club i don't remember anything about||
||Ehhhhh, i don't get any ship vibes from any of them||
||gah! whoops. ||
||some surprise for sure. But I think it was the moment that lead to the outside conversation at the end of hte episode||
bocchi 8 ||That Bocchi is 'guitarhero' on youtube.||
cause she is starting to figure it out
No. Bocchi Great
||yeah, he seemed like a bro. But now he is clearly  not. And I realy wanted him to just be a bro||
||I am also disappointed a bit in Shaddiq. I really liked him up to this ep. Then he suddenly got kinda scummy||
I feel like both of them are a bit to tied up in 'their thing' for it.

Suletta is just coming to school, and finding out everything there. Multiple attempts on stealing her gundam. The tests, finding a house, etc

While Miorine has all her father focused drama going on. Now the events of ep7/8, and fighting against that.

||We got that little affectionate head lean against suletta which is really just a little tease of it. But we went 4.5 seasons without HIbiki realizing she was in love with Miku, so I can wait.||
||This also just feels like good old fashioned parental manipulation||
I do hope that Drunk-chan makes it onto the chart though
see the chart be

Bocchi
Nijika
suletta
miorine

is so on point
make it Miorine
And because I want to feel bad, what is old?
||yamcha that you?||
||Is it me or is there something up with Ryo's eyes. Like they draw the right(hair) pupil smaller than the other?||
> Bocchi 9

||The part in the preinto about the room being a black hole is such a good analogy for anxiety/depression. The way t just draws you in and doesn't let you escape||
I was really confused about what was on her head, until I realized they were upside down
Cant wait to get home and watch

angius just finished his blind watch. His stuff is good https://youtube.com/@Angiuss

Should check out Bocchi
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Bocchi/gwitch seem to be the big/popular ones for this season. I dont see nearly as many comments on other stuff like bleach Or spy family
I believe moderation bots dont jive well with threads
I propose a category for ‚Äúseasonal anime

Included gwitch 9 spoilers || https://old.reddit.com/r/Symphogear/comments/zcgey9/the_hamster_wheel_spins_on/||
or in the like, for as long as I can remember them being on the server
<:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
||I would 100% see him going to Gund-Arm and being like "my dad wants me to learn business. I want to learn business from you||
||That does make sense I guess. Thinking back on it, only the leader's antenna matters. And Trill(till?) was on their team right?||
||I knew he wasn't gonna say yes when they fielded 6 suits. If they were ilke 'this is all we could field' and went with 4 or 5, Guel 100% would have come in to save them. But I feel like he is on the tilting point of joining team earth||
This being on a cd is amazing
||Super happy to see her come back and take the shot. Although its a bt like 'wasn't she eliminated?"||
||minute later and I am satisfied||
> gwitch 9

||I'm like 7 minutes in and they are talking about not having enough pilots. If they don't got o Guel and ask him I'ma riot||
That‚Äôs horrifying
Oh Ryou is still great and I love her.  But the other3 of the band are great. 

> 8

||and drunk-chan crushed my heart in a way that skyrocketed her up my best girl chart||
> bocchi 8+

||Considering how little she has been a front and center in the last two eps Im okay with that||
4/4 kessoku band

Its really early to make any kind of judgement obviously. 

The super talented at <shows thing> is something that makes me ü§¢ at a lot of shows. Especially isekai because they tend to be super power fantasy
Back in the beginning of the series ash sucked. He got through his initial challenges with friendship and creative thinking. Alongside w fair bit of heart and hard work. 

Sure later on he may have been great, but those early days laid the groundwork for him to struggle
Although imo a ‚Äúscary talented battler‚Äù isnt interesting at all. Cause like‚Ä¶. K?
Surname‚Ä¶.. ketchum?
Even with Bocchi‚Äôs social anxiety being the crux of the show, there is still growth and agency on her behalf.
My dude lost his fancy earphones
its true, you could be `reincanred into the best friend of princess knight and working at a yuri brothel`

But as a what!?
uhh, lesbian brothels
https://media.tenor.com/ZAHrrdiccbYAAAAM/the-powerpuff-girls-curses.gif
ironically i prefer the 'lesbian brothels' naming than "That one time that something almost interesting happened but now i am going ot make an anime out of it" naming style
Where did season 1 end aa far as chapters
> bocchi 12

||I went back and checked. She used Drunk-chan's sake bottles to do the sliding thing with her guitar. Which I wouldn't be surprised if she slid one of the bottles over towards Bocchi when she noticed the problems she was having.||
I'm not sure if Bocchi is something I can repeatedly rewatch. 

But I'll be damned if it didn't carve a little spot in my heart under the stairs.
Yo, this visual is so good
ahhhh shit. Bocchi 12 just hit me 

||At 5:45 when Kita covers for Bocchi, while she figures out how to handle her busted string. Her friends looking out and covering for her. || right in my heart
I didn't notice during the watch that she was drumming with guitars
||I think I am happier to see her improve adapt and overcome in a situation where she would have normaly crumbled. The fact its Drunk-chan's bottle she uses is just icing on the cake||
I wish they did it this way
This is typical Ryo
KitaXwanting to be noticed by ryo
Best girl
> bocchi

I will also say that there is growth, you can even see it in the first episode. So its not like the whole season is flat. There is a lot of inspiration and positive aspects about how the show handles her anxiety.  She is working towards healing her trauma, and you do get to see it.
Yeah I get it. maybe the analogy didn't land
You gotta put on your own oxygen mask first. Take care of yourself.
||Yeah, that she sees a lot of herself in Bocchi and is trying to prevent that. I legit teared up and had to pause ep8 because Hiroi's showing up first to be there for Bocchi just hit me in the heart in such a way I was never expecting||
found the clip <https://youtu.be/YBKKGYku6og>

> bocchi 9+

||Its funny that she says that drunk chan is more outgoing, but its only because she is basicially killing herself with drinking to try and avoid her problems||
I getcha. ngl, there were two times on first watch i had to pause to wipe proto-tears away. And it certainly envoked a strong emotional connection. And I am not someone who has had to directly deal with anxiety to the degree in the show.

The wife has some anxiety issues, if anything the show helped me understand what is going on in her head more. That the irrational spirals Bocchi goes on are just that irrational but its not something that she can stop because they are irrational
ohhhhh
whatchu mean?
If that was your concern
It treats the anxiety subject with respect (imo). Sure there are jokes made around it, but its never AT Bocchi for the way she is.
Sorta.
I would say gundam if your not a binger so your ready for the finale. 

Or Bocchi.
Or when she needs to dispense violence
still waiting for the last ep of hte cour before the binge
Thats some art right there
> bocchi

I have this crazy idea for a series of posts about

This is why `[each character one by one]`is the most important character in bocchi.

Cause its a little crazy how much each character feels important
Shoulda been drunk-chan
It won everything it was a valid choice for except best op, and I think best supporting female character
Her battle with chris shall be legendary
cour 2 of spy family really drug it down for me
What would be your other choices for anime of the year? Which anime had an impact on you

Theory ||sus-mom is gonna fly aeril to where suletta is||
Well its computer people, but they are transported into a game.
actually while we're getting crazy. 

Beastwars and transformers are isekai
Perhaps you should ask if Reboot is an isekai
They go into the computer if I remember it right
althouhg I imagine there are those people out there that would get pedantic about it. since its the same world, just a different time
I would say yes
what about prophane accessories?
That was one of my biggest pedantic hates about episode 2

I cant imagine that it wouldn‚Äôt get a season 2 ar this point. Its crushing sales everywhere
Bruh. 

Thats so poetic
Im hype
That is kind of a perfect translation.

Would be cool if they did samus with the power armor on the *near* whole time, and some voice alteration, then reveal herself at the end. Kinda like in the original game.
Oh god, I am an idiot.
now i'm thinking about who would be their 'main 3'.

Mario bros, obviously. Dk and Sonic?

Samus?
What if that is what the mario movie turned out to be?

"I'm here to talk to you about the smash initiative"

Or just having a letter in a post credits
Lemme pose a terrible truth. 

This stuff had always been happening through the years. It is only recently, through our constant and increasing connectivity, that we are hearing more about it. That its being called out or persecuted
Because they are above America
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Waiiiit you somehow made it all this time and didn't boccher?
I feel like jack is the kind of show that could still get a lot of people inspired with how it handles Art direction
Those shows and Samurai Jack wrre so good
Thats fair. 

I dunno how much importance it is in the source material, but I havent seen any reason so far that its an important aspect
The little pie chart that popped up in the first episode, is something I was hoping would pop up in the other two
https://youtu.be/ViOqUak8-bI
It also gave me the idea to rip parts of the main idea here, chained echos, legend of the gilgamechs off if I ever run a ttrpg where it would applicable for thr setting
I saw the thread on r/anime about hte baby vs the dragon, and a bunch of people calling the MC "Girl Goku", which I found kinda funny. Which is why I went and watched the eps
Which thanks to Symphogear I know that Chris, means "the anointed one" which makes sense
And they seem to switch between calling her Chris, and Ingils (or however its spelled)
thats why I'm like.... Uhhhh, little weird there
yeah
Its pretty gay right?
Whats the temperature on "reborn to master the blade"?

I just watched the first three episodes and I think i am kinda into it. Granted I was into Sword isekai until episode 9~ or so when it broke its own rules

> sword isekai 

||During the fight vs the demon in the dungeon. Where the greater demon was level 30 or whatever, then Fran/shisho just kinda beat it anyway. Where going for the objective would have been a better ending. Like if they could have just beaten him despire the 13~~ level difference, why didn't they just do it.||
hence the transition to anime!

80/90's was prime OP time.
Fantasy knockout was the other one I watched some of and i dropped it after 7 or 8 episodes as it was just kind a mehhhhhh to me
Yeah. Without any of the cringey aspects that would be easy in the genre.
Ah. That makes sense then. I wasnt sure if was a thing where ‚Äúhero king‚Äù versions name became a surname or something that got passed down. So she became her own descendant or something
> reborn//squire

I like a lot of the little things they have done so far. 

Got the ‚ÄúA GIRL?!‚Äù Joke/idea out of the way before the first Op. Mc seems just fine being a girl as we see her growing up. Even the little apology for previous actions is cool. 

The isekai bullshit comes, explains itself, and moves on quickly. Like with what runes do, or how magic ‚Äúworks‚Äù. Which feeds into my next thing. 

I like how Mc isnt Op just because she is Mc. Its a trope/cliche that ‚Äú*objects from a past civilization/lost technology is kore powerful than things we have today *‚Äù and thats all she is. A relic from this previous civilization brought forward to current day. So they are just skipping the ‚Äúgo find lost ancient relic step  of fantasy. As well as giving us the lore from stuff that she knows, and is learning how things have changed.
That was a big +1 for me as well
What about ameri-mecha? https://youtu.be/poV2mZuVOjI
ya know, I feel like they should have incorporated that into the picture here. Feels like tha tmakes sense
CSM people in charge fucked up the distrobution which is what screwed it up

I only saw the first episode of that show (more this weekend I think). And they got me good with the 'gotcha' isekai.

When they said "dude got hit by a truck', I was thinking *oh shit, bro got isekaied*.
