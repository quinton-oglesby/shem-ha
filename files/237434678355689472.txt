Hi all, Kanade has agreed to help get the items from the Dub Gallery Akihabara event (http://www.cocollabo.net/sp/symphogear2019/). If there is something you want from there, please fill in the form by 4th July so that Kanade can plan his schedule for the trip down. Also, please note that for this, we will be pooling in for Kanade's travel fare down to Akihabara cause it isnt cheap for him to head down. For this, we will require a minimum number of people to want to buy something from the event to make it worth for Kanade to make the trip. I have made it such that you're able to edit your responses, so if you have submitted wrongly you will be able to change your responses, or contact me cause I will be able to delete the copy of your response in case you filled in wrongly.  Kanade would like for us to pay him for the travel fare first, and then pay him for our items once he gets them(just in case some items have run out of stock), so once we have enough responses, we will wait for news from Kanade.

~~and i think they cant really let XDU die~~
~~love live final live occurred a year after the movie aired~~
ðŸ˜¦
im actually sad that its the last season alr
oh they updated animation for giga zep
https://tenor.com/view/purga-the-juzgue-show-lady-nada-ellaesmina-dragqueen-gif-12794460
and testament
i just like the unison songs
actually
fuugetsu
ðŸ˜¼
join it and you will know
i'll check later
it is?!
i havent went to search for the song
idk
Shenshoujing getting repaired
ðŸš”
he wanted to rape maria, shirabe and kirika
TT
why did they do this to her
im sad for tsubasa
its saddening
but
yea
after she managed to step out of it
them digging up Tsubasa's sad past again
this is saddening
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Maria going all onee-san on Tsubasa
rofl
kiri's transformation scene is pure fan service
i swear
i prefer testament OP though
rofl
xoming soon
testament v2
oh is that
TOBI TATTE
i still prefer AXZ OP
https://nyaa.si/view/1159531
~~i hope we get the extra 10 seconds in the bluray version~~
ðŸ˜¦
I should watch on day of release so I can discuss too
ONE PUNCH
i think he will die from the power he wished so hard to have
i doubt he will though
Tsubasa shall put a blade in Fudo
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>

i cant give it to you cause i got this
i guess shit's going to hell
well
wew
tsubasa's lips
hahahaha
so many jii happenings
TT
someone save tsubasa
i hvent watched it but
puppy!!
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
maybe that's why carol hasnt been released yet
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
but they're reliable allies
they were annoying last time
wew
carol's back
ohhhh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gBugbh8naGw
https://tenor.com/view/ahah-miaouw-cat-dog-fighting-gif-13756004
AXZ i think was fine for the hype
Oh now Fudo fucked up
anyone noticed this?
there MIGHT be a movie
or if the gears arent
the relics will be destroyed or sth
i feel like at the end
depending on the ending i think
well
but let's see how they do the ending
ðŸ˜¦
i actually still want more symphogear after this season
this isnt DBZ
or early episode 10
i think they'll solve the miku in episode 9
rofl
we're hyping ourselves up
Shikikan samas would quit the game
i dont think we will get a madoka ending though
https://tenor.com/view/tiny-text-gif-5154350
but he fails and goes crazy
and then fudo tries to take the power into him
it would go like hibiki getting shemha out
i think
now now
somehow hibiki would punch shemha's soul into oblivion
nah
gear users have a 25% chance of dying
that's not true.
she has plot armour
i was wondering why metal balls were there
ah ok i see
but more cool
pachinko is slots?
so
we're gambling in XDU too <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
but i was like if i started i'll probably spend whatever i brought there
i wanted to try tbh


<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
ask Kanade for his opinion that Japan loves Symphogear
Pachinko <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
https://tenor.com/view/avatar-korra-feels-feels-trip-overwhelmed-gif-6366388
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
headpatting basa
its a yearly award
well
Father of the year award
Maybe the Tower of Babel is the key to defeating God
just like how Basa convinced Shirabe that she is kind
Basa will fight Shirabe
shrugs
or sth
i reject the notion
and basa would be like if that's how the sword is supposed to protect the nation
fudo gonna take the power for himself
well i guess after shem ha
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
everyone knows that so idk why i spoiler tag that
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
||Cause its a confession from Shirabe to Kirika||
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
apparently you never checked the lyrics for Draft Folder
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
"Otono no kaidan wo noboru toki wa"
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>

Zababa?
https://tenor.com/view/gilgamesh-kunai-gate-of-babylon-fate-stay-night-gif-14427496
only gungnir i think
let's see how it goes
well
so
they died by miku's
ok i mean
ya but let them die by the gear users' hands though
since they arent exactly human
yet
and i dont think they died
they got killed off in the most unfulfilling way
but
or was it underwater
i forgot where he died
maybe
he's dead on the moon
Fudo is just an old fart who cannot move on w times
hmm
though i want him to go into mental shock and him getting tortured mentally
i actually dont want fudo to die
Basa getting her revenge on Maria
~~gear users can breathe in space~~
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
that scene was actually kind cute though
with a bang

bikki grabbing chris' boob
hmm
miku going around triggering flags
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
why not both
that's Hibiki after punching Shem ha's ass
https://tenor.com/view/loki-enough-avengers-god-gif-11548394
hopefully they add the extra scenes in the bluray release
Chris went bankai
rofl
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
fuck
im sad
TT
watch the last episode
im gonna do it
cause they all cant get past the great firewall of china
~~at least there's still XDU~~
yet
so i guess they wouldnt let it end
symphogear does roll in quite some money
well i mean
there's technically still so much to tell
they gotta explain the backstories of the alchemists in details
Symphogear: story of alchemists
Song artificially creating artifacts
inb4 Symphogear sunshine
~~symphogear movie in between then~~
THE UPCOMING ONE WONT BE THE LAST
they had 2 more lives
when love live anime ended
~~symphogear movie~~
she was

TT
im definitely not crying
ðŸ˜­
im not crying
and thus the strongest attack is a hug
that title
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
carol
rofl
he was never shown was he
we wouldnt either
but Tsubasa was praying for her father
it does
well
maybe he's serving his time on the moon
maybe?
shrugs
so its a cliffhanger regarding the gears
technically they didnt show anything
you know how they usually hang it around their necks and hidden in their clothes?
well
Gungnir datto
we all know what happened after they looked at the stars <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
datto shite mo
~~they gotta animate the extra 10 seconds of kiri's transformation~~
man
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
i am but a fleeting moment
or has it
hasnt killed me yet
~~idol hell~~
<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
no one minds actually but i thought i'd throw that in for the fun of it

"I want Miku for myself"
AXZ: I think i need an explanation to the explanation
Symphogear raising flags
waiting for WW to be released
and im lazy to really read the story + my phone doesnt have space
AS isnt easy
ðŸ˜¦
there's nothing to look forward to anymore
what do i have to watch now
now symphogear is over
first sunshine movie ended
my life is over
nice
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
i think he sent to you alr right hahah
Have you got your stuff from kanade?
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Hi Saki
who said it cant survive another 5000 years
Fine created the symphogears and it survived 5000 years
yea
just blares Chris
Kanade would just mindlessly and tirelessly slaughter noise
if Tsubasa died
well
Symphogear's strongest attack: ~~Gay~~ Hug
hahahaha
let's not forget that Miku can actually beat most Olympic participants
Biki literally fisted Shem-ha ~~out of Miku XD~~
yea
idk how to describe it
i thought metanoia was kinda dark(?)
like sth more hype than test
i was expecting a more upbeat song for OP though
???
waiting for WW version
SIFAS
and yes i do play SIF
idol hell
TT
i want more of Nanjou's voice acting
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
you arent in the bully rosen club yet
ahahaha
unless you changed your ign
havent rolled you yet i think
are you in S1 arena?
oo
ðŸ˜¦
<@106866895076003840> i dont see you in game much anymore
supporting Symphogear all the way
Shem Ha
they would have released it last year
if they wanted to release
never
play XDU
who the fuck can outrun a noise rofl
i mean
and it was a foreshadowing of Miku getting a gear esp w her amazing stamina
S1 was the appetizer
well
Around the world in 80 days
Bikki and Miku will go on a honeymoon
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Zwei Wing v2
Tsubasa and Maria
physical education teacher or sth
i think kiri would be like
Kirika music teacher?
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
applicable to real life as well
how to save your waifu: Hugs
god doesnt exist in symphogear anymore
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
the staff left the ending open for a reason
you may kiss the bride
I now pronounce you wife and wife
taste my flames
that'll come out for XDU
maybe the staff wanted to show like elfnien no longer needed carol to "protect" her
well i guess at least
that carol had to disappear
its just kinda sad
i mean
well i guess
i thought she deserved another chance
yea but she pretty much redeemed herself
maybe the staff didnt like it that there're two souls inhabiting a single body
i mean it can go both ways
ðŸ˜¦
so they both can create new happy memories w the gear users
i would rather have the staff make elfnien and carol lose half their memories each
but she fully redeemed herself alr
she might have been a villian
ðŸ˜¦
i lost my shit at the part where carol said bye
i half lost my shit there
yep
hahahaha
rofl
that one was the most literal
oh wait
and adam
except ver
hibiki fists all the evil intents out of villians
maybe
kinda
Maria and Basa mama for each other
Maria and Basa are the mamas of the group
Bayonet Charge
what's that song
shit
cause of uh
there's no chris one so this will have to do
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
everyone of them likes chris
rofl
Chris has evryone
~~XDU carol event~~
Fukkatsu no Carol
"you're no longer the weak kid that needs protection"
hahahaha
So does Millhi, Hibiki
"I want Miku for myself"
probably wont happen if the only thing different in that timeline was basa dying instead of kanade
maybe one day the devs will make a season 3 for AU Kanade
error 404 not found
cause Kanade didnt have bikki to pull her hand
i think
but slightly worse?
yea
hmmmm
when your brain doesnt spin fast enough to note your grammar mistakes
<:GWcentralPikaLUL:377110562116468766>
sometimes it messes up
for my grammar
im sorry
that event was over
had
~~until Tsubasa died in an alternate universe~~
she's just overly friendly
esp AXZ
they've been confessing throughout the whole series
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
