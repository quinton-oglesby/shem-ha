if only we had a bot who could stop external emoji spam with out turning them all off
also wasnt Saki made staff int he first place to do the bots?

<:thinksgender:401602471035666432>
I mean I was just really depressed and dysphoric and was gonna kill myself, then I randomly watched this anime and related so hard to Hibiki, like I had a person I really loved and respected who killed her self when on my 15th birthday, and just the way that Hibiki dealt with the trauma she endured was really similar and comforting to me, so I ended up just going by Hibiki on the internet and using that as an "excuse" to embrace my feminine side which ended up being the first thing that felt right to me, needless to say I've since come out to people and started HRT and had fun family times â„¢ like weekly eviction threats and stuff
Well symphogear is what helped me realize I was trans
Not like we're plotting to put chemicals in the water to turn the frogs gay
Dw about it
On Thursday I went and smoked weed and cuddled with two other trans girls
All trans girls are beautiful
Tbh
<:transhugs:358356870127157249> <:traalove:355977253311610881> <:transhugs:358356870127157249> I wanna meet them all
I approve of this
Yes!! <:transheart:430884332358336513> <:transheart:430884332358336513>
I'm truly among my people <3
Omg are there other trans girls here?:o
This girl sounds super interesting
<:transegg:351574219600953354> <:transegg:351574219600953354> <:transegg:351574219600953354>
I could have started mine immediately but the one doctor I could go to for informed consent was super booked in the summer
LMAO they made hets into a real thing?
I've only been out for a year and on hrt for like 8 and a half months
Congrats
Omg
And that's totally valid too!!
I know a lot of people who started and then stopped for a while and started again
But you can stop and start hrt freely
And it's all because I'm finally right
My life is finally getting back together
I'd like myself if I stopped
It makes me feel so stable and good emotionally
For me it's just
I mean
If your estrogen is too high it can cause estrogenic cancers that are less likely in AMAB people
Like I can not ever live my life with out hrt again
That's what I said
Because it can cause cancer
But my mom looked stuff up and keeps trying to guilt me into stopping my hrt
My mom did the same thing!! Luckily most of family is dead or has disowned my immediate family unit
Gl Vi!
but yeah i can see how that could be annoying
2hu?
its important though to understand that once you change once even if not legally its really hard to change a second time
not everyone even changes their name
I went by Alex for a really long time and just recently changed to Alyx
yeah and thats totally okay
Like it feels weird and kinda sexual with the extent they really make those children suffer and it just makes me feel icky
But the others were not as good
I thought Yuki Yuna did good
Someone told me symphogear was gay and they sent me the beef stroganoff song
It also makes me so sad when the poor anime girls have to suffer <:traasob:367669572645552128> <:traasob:367669572645552128>
It doesn't have to be edgy to be good
Like give me empowering feminity
Yeah I want good pure sparkly magical girls to make a come back too
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Like aaaaaaaaaaaaaa
Same hat!!!
Vi did you also have the constant dreams of finding the magical thing that transforms you into a magical girl?
The only time I look down on people for stuff like that is when they try to talk over queer people when it comes to queer people's expierence other wise it's just as bs as cishets looking down on you
I know!! I'm so excited to meet more trans people!!
I'm still holding out hope my mom will come around
I'm glad he came around! It can take a lot for parents to understand and like I also kinda get how for them it can feel like losing a child somewhat
It's good she understands that at least!!
is she accepting?
lied to their family a lot about a lot of stuff
most trans people i know
thats honestly trans culture
yeah that'd be a lot better i feel
or will you have to go back home during hollidays and stuff
will you be able to live at uni for the full 4 y ears
ðŸ˜¦
yeah
its hard though
and if they treat you like shit you can just let it go
and give them one chance
that not all family is blood and not all blood is family
and come out to them and just be able to understand and accept
try and build up a support network at uni
thats the best way to go with unsupportive family
yeah
oh
ðŸ˜®
to shine or glow in Maori
flower in Persian too!
moon in Albanian
and grace in hebrew
it means hope in Kurdish
and it means so many things in so many languages
Hana is so pretty
yeah
ive been thinking about actually changing my name but I was gonna go for Hana but then people associate me with D.va ðŸ˜¦
yeah i can understand that ðŸ˜¦ i sitll get deadnamed by my mom all the time and ive been using my name for 9 years
They drew the pride flag geahs right?
It's pretty
I like dls art style
I'm ready rn tbqh fampai
Straight people actually exist?
Ty for being you
I honestly love you people
Sounds like we should get rid of all states federal and local <:ancomflag:403752428694011914> <:ancomflag:403752428694011914>
I mean if we just made all trans people use the bathrooms they were assigned at birth
Public bathrooms are one of my greatest fears as a trans woman
And yeah honestly opiods > most commerical pain killers
"Ronald Reagan's grave is a gender neutral bathroom" is my favorite phrase
I'm glad he's dead
Honestly fuck Reagan
They are pretty great
Or how opioids where an epidemic that was left as a "criminal problem" for years when it impacted poor black and queer communities but now it's effecting cishet white people and suddenly it's a "national health crisis"
And one was used by the white upper class
But one was predominantly used in black communities (after being introduced by Reagan)
Or like how crack had much harsher sentencing than coke even tho they are the same drug
We smart ðŸ¤”
So we outlaw the plant heck yeah
Or how big pharama worked to keep weed illegal (which was also driven by Nixion era racism to win over white southren voters)
Even Google could barely do it and it was too much for them to continue
Look at ISPs in America and how damn near impossible it is to start a new isp
Then you pay off politicians to close off the market
You want nice free open markets until you can take control
Which is also part of the whole "get in power and pull the ladder up behind you" idealogy that drives most capitalist
Or rather can't devote your life to starting a bussiness
The whole point is most people have to slave away 40++ hours a week to simply not die, so unless you're already so privileged that you don't have to you can't really start a business
Or people who live in a poor area and can't afford a car so they cant even get to a bank
Which is privilege
You still need to have start up capital or at least the credit to get a loan
That's also true
And like even with small business owners and stuff I don't seem them as en enemy inheriantly but rather as other people who are a convenience scape goat for the rich to turn the workers against each other
The capital class tho is the people who own the means of production, such as factories or businesses, not the 1%
1% of income maybe, but no one who's actually a laborer outside of very specific labour aristocrats (like celebrities) are in the 1% of wealth
You're ignoring the privilege required to even get into the corporate game
I mean I don't see anything good about having a non working class of parasites controlling the means of production and enslaving the rest of humanity through wage slavery, as is the system of capitaly working as intended
It's all stolen from the workers
Especially cuz the people who have all the money do little to none of the labour
Money is bullshit
All the straight trans girls I know deep stealth
Those are really close
That's more surprising to me
Oh wow
I've only ever met straight trans girls online
A lot more common than straight trans girls I've found
There's a lot of straight trans guys
That seems about right to me
And all my irl friends are trans or lesbians or bi
Like the only other place I really hang out online is a trans only discord
It's certianly a different experience
Also that's the best bi joke I've ever heard
Just get qt girl dick Ibu
Hi
I low-key forget straight people exist sometimes
Did you just assume their humor?
I just assume no one is cis
Lol
Me too
Tbh
I would hope they were trans
I mean
Heck yeah
But just going out and about
If you're going to pirde I'd say you wouldn't really want to
But like context is your friend
I wouldn't ever tell anyone not to wear it
I mean pink blue and white is the best color combo on Earth
Male failing and then using a urinal is top tier power move tbh
But the bigger issue is any symbol like that can easily be taken and used against vulnerable people
Start wearing pride colors imo
All bathrooms would be gender neutral?
I know another trans girl in the UK who has to wait a really long time for hormones
Yeah the NHS is fucky and tragic
The head of the EPA has like 17 corruption investigations
Idk it seems really bad
Yeah
Hell yeah Anarchy in the UK
But most Democrats are moving to abortion is okay sometimes
Yeah Brexit is bad
Tbf
I mean I just know the memes about the papers attacking him
Ah
I'm not English
Or at least was my understanding
Now he's for a hard brexit instead of a soft brexit and staying in the EU with tons of concessions
He also was against brexit until it was decided on wasn't he?
But the papers told me he wants to March the Tories in the sea
Jeremy corbyn
You're from the land of the absolute boy
Heck yeah
I mean there's a difference between "trans people are okay with me" and being actively positive and inviting of trans people into your spaces
I'm always really down to help educate people
Like do you have any trans terms you have trouble understanding?
Yeah that's totally fair and valid
She might just not have the same exposure to trans people, ever ancom I've met has been super trans positive
I'm actually much closer to a post leftest than an ancom tbh
I'll tuck it back in
Ty Tongzhi
And terfs deserve the wall
Those are terfs
If y'all have questions I can help answer
Like passing
It's kinda a bs concept created to try and force trans people into a cis world
No one has so stealth
You just don't know they're trans
So you might know a few
Makes it easier to tell when places are good or not
I just mentioned I was trans cuz I don't like waiting to come out
It's a safe space
So please don't invite cis people :P
Everyone on the server is trans
I dm'd y'all links
Oh yeah do y'all wanna join my trans server?
She does
<a:heartz:453408150784049172>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
I hope I can meet them someday
Tiny Miku sounds super interesting
<3
And ever since starting hrt I've had maternal instincts turned up to 11
Like it's just such a powerful validating feeling
I've been kinda a mother figure for some young trans girls I know and having them call me mom literally melted my heart the first time
I just wanna be a mom
Really tho
Free from the bs of the rest of society
I honestly just wanna be able to build my trans commune and live their with my chosen family
Are you an imperalist?
That's imperalism too
But who's enforcing the rule of the empire?
More like I say abolish borders
I'm just gonna put chemicals in the water to turn the frogs gay
Tyrants need not apply
The UK and the us at it again
We can be allies
Laura Jane Grace is my VP
I'll make America gay again
Every vote for Alyx for president
The titty Skittles lady
That's my dream job tbh
Heck yeah
I am too broke to pay for medicine
And like if something goes wrong medically I am just going to die
I mean I have to pay for everything
Where as I made an appointment (online) went in had blood work and a script for hrt
Yeah it's like a year for therapy then a year of therapy and "life experience" as your preferred gender than some time only on AA then finally estrogen
"my God they gave a black man more power than me better elect this incompetent fascist now"
And an aquarium
Lots of concerts and cons too
From what I've heard
Atlanta has good night life too
So hot tho
Savannah is really nice
:P
Visit me
The area around it tho
Atl is pretty lit
Heck yeah
I live in the North metro area
65 in the burbs 55 in the city
Yeah 70 is the limit on all rural high ways in GA
Durning night hours
People in Atlanta drive over 90 in the city
<:transhugs:358356870127157249> <:transhugs:358356870127157249>
Is that a good thing?
No problem
If I might get a chance to say it organically
I don't usually like to just shout into the void tho
Gl vi
But I come out within a day or every server
Right after I joined
I saw the symbols in people's names and saw people talking about
reddit is rude
aww
Eat the fridge
Just eat the food
Honestly hitting 100mph is amazing
dont most animals in heat fuck?
can you even change your documents in Canada with out srs?
just dont talk to cops
even the cops tell you
She had revision for comp sci to do
I talked to her Monday morning
The ping for pics girl?
And some people can stick to them
They're good for weight cycling tho
i could honestly eat rice  with every meal
I know a lot of people have really good results from keto!!
Awww that sounds really hard:(
Awwww
I eat popcorn while watching toonaime every week
I love popcorn
It's gonna be so bad
i should stay in my fucking place
tbh
how dare i
yeah
<:thinksgender:401602471035666432>
cuz we did this to her
maeb her parents will hate us
honestly tho
<:samehat:355226366276403220>
~~sorry if that doesnt sound serious enough im like really upset about that~~
lmao
"thats a girl"

but like i meet a lot of cool people and we hang out doing other things
for some people its more supporty
like
a bunch of trans people hanging out
is more like
my group
i mean yah
im sure you could find a cool trans group in ny

~~thats mostly a joke dw~~
so i can be mute
and still consider cutting my vocal cords out
super gross and manly
i sound
i bet you sound really cute
to Arizona
im probably moving
sadly
for my mental health
i started going to a trans group and its been really good
but yah i feel
i have a car
ðŸ¤”
im sorry Kriisa
i'll be ur friend
but i also never had an understanding of what a good baseline was
cuz i felt so much better with it
like it was hard for me to realize hrt wasnt magic that was gonna fix all my problems
about the therapy
thats really good advice
but
iidk
sureeeee
ur amaezing
Alice
~~i might~~
yeah!
<:thinksgender:401602471035666432>
Egg
Egg
Egg
<:transegg:351574219600953354>
What
Is scrmz egg or not
Wait
If you could grab a cheap purse you could just carry them with you
i know a lot of trans people who have had bad expierences trying to get the police to try and help them with abusive parents
and might not help
police are a fuck
but also
Ask her
Can probably get you a 90 or 180 day supply
Your doctor
Maeb someone else can host them
Rip Kiri Chan
it'll all work out im sure
yeah
XD
that Hana wasnt a name my parents considered
i made sure
and just an important character in that story when i wrote it out as a novel too
was my tabletop character as well
Hana
Idk if intersex is like genes or physical stuff or both
She might count?
Which idk
There's also intersex people
i dont htink thats bad
2 dollars
a choclate bar is like
Oh that feels good
And she was like
And called her a girl
About them being an egg
Then I just started memeing
"I'm a cis guy"
But then they were like
Another trans girl on this server
And was like oh cool
So I met saki
Ya
Oh
What
Idk when I joined
Yeah and like who knows how long people have been thinking about stuff
Everyone has their own speed
@what saki said
Yeah
What
Who
Probably
I'm cool vodka aunt
Plz don't try to copy me
Ya for sure
Tbqh
I probably shouldn't have done what I did with saki
But ya
Cuz honestly this place is so busy I don't read anything but pings
Is there an egg to crack
Less than a week
In like
We also found a place to get hrt
Ya
B4 screaming about marxism
I'm also gonna leave this convo
That's just supporting the status quo
Implying most of those kids don't just follow their parents when they're 18 anyway
the tories are going down too
yeah ukip is dead
48% of people said that migration was the important issue
The 'Leave' campaign campaigned primarily on issues relating to sovereignty and migration,[5] whereas the remain campaign focused on the economic impacts of leaving the EU. This choice of key positions is significant since Ipsos MORI survey data on which issues Britons felt to be 'important issues facing Britain today' shows that immediately prior to the vote, more people cited both the EU (32%) and migration (48%) as important issues than cited the economy (27%).[6]
i mean the trade thing is factually incorrect and the primary reason for voting leave is immigration
supporting racist policies is being racist
I mean they can vote for it, but they will be being racist by doing so
p much exactly
yeah
then dont fucking vote for it
its just a long form "im not racist but"
i mean it clearly shows that theyre okay with using racism as a tool to get what they want
thats true, but the same also holds true for voting for brexit which was run on fears of immigratns taknig jobs and racism against the polish, voting for that shows that you either dont care about or agree with the bigoted message the person is presenting
if someone voted for donald trump theyre a bad person who implicatly supports racism and homophobia
good they shouldnt feel comfortable to share bigioted views
ah yes better compromise, put the kids in the camps but let them stay with their families right?
Lmao you actually think being a communist and being a racist are comparable at all?
If you voted for Trump you are racist or don't think being racist is a bad thing
If you vote for and support senators who are putting Mexican kids in camps *you are racist*
America has Trump because America if full of fascist and we're in the downturn of a failing capitalist state so they're preying on people's fears of the "immigrants taking our jobs" and shit to get elected
Genius
So fucking up trading with the people who support the vast majority of your economy to trade with other people? That the EU was already working on trading with
Can you name one?
There's also the fact that there is no reason to vote leave besides racism
Brexit is a prime example of why you should take the 10 mins to not let insane racist destroy your country's future
I mean it barely exisit at all bcuz of how people are raised and educated in a system that activly promoted conformity as the only way to survive
I think they're just trying to make sure he is introspective
Ty for talking to me
I hope you can find what you want from cross dressing
Valid
Is there a reason youd feel more comfortable looking like a girl but not being called a girl?
Yeah but like,why? Would just looking like a girl make you happy?
But if you don't want people to consider you female why do you want to pass as female visually?
But you also don't want to lie to people?
Like does the idea of people seeing you as a girl make you happy?
Why would you wanna pass as female to correct people that you are male?
Also feel free to tell me to shut the fuck up at any point if my questions get too invasive
Also +1 on sweatpants
On masucline days would you want people to gender you male? And like if you were cross dressing and people were gendering you female would you correct them?
Is it like a constant thing or do you just wanna CD like that sometimes?
Do you wanna pass as a woman to yourself or other people?? Or both?
So like you wanna look attractive??
By worked do you mean you cross dress and pass as a woman?
When have you ever seen a character that's specifically called a cross dresser and specifically said to be cis gender called trans??
That's awesome
Cable companies are trying to kill streaming because  capitalism stifles innovation, companies get big and they use their power (through money) to oppose new innovations like how the oil industry is literally killing the planet to not lose money from renewable energy
are you like seriously going this *h a m* on rape apologia
are you defending the serial rapist?
what?
I think ignoring the role media has in influncing people is super dishonest
do we not need to respect the same sex?
some times victims dont want to deal with the legal process of facing their assaulter
plz stop tryign to shame people for not speaking out about other people being victimized
yall
they probably didnt think it was their place to talk about someone else b eing sexually assaulted
nah random youtubers >>>>>>>>>>>> a rapist coworkers to know them Xddd
fuck
actual
what the a
um
lmao
soem random youtuber
also this is just
its also just mega insensitive to say to anyone who is a sexual assault survivor to do this victim blaming bs
its a different server
its like a support server thing
if you'd be interested in joining a trans space on discord i can shoot you an invite
<:transheart:489188059712192512>
congratulations
lol
precure made me trans
not serious discussion
but also yes
precure is the best mahou shoujo
||the whole thing where the titans are like kept in ghettos and wear arm bands and shit|| <----------- snk spoilers
and then like if yall dotn mind spoilers
its the story of a white europen coded guy with a german name fighting to reclaim his homeland from subhuman monsters that consume everything in their path
yeah AoT SNK
but thats more of the author was bad at showing them as bad
and the fascist themes it ahs in the begining
just like SNK
yes
no HIV
got my results
I'm not too worried
So
I mean everyone I have intimate contact with also does hiv testing every 3-6 months
Ty
It's so stressful
Do HIVtest
Y'all ever just
me2
yeaaaa
fuck it
eh
and was just like
like i was the one who had condoms
10000%
it was on me
well i mean
=== big hiv risk
amab people and being dumb and not using condoms or anything
but like
i normally dont hook up with amab people
yeah
and get paid for it
but i also get hiv tested every 3 months
so i was midly worried
its normally okay but i did a dumb thing and had a dumb hook up
yeah exactly
its more of hierarchly power strucutres that used religion as a tool to grow that power that are the problem
I think religion still has value in peoples lives
also alien relgiion gang
nondetermnistically spritual gang
not just trans people either, lots of queer people end up finding their chosen family
Family is more than blood anyway
youre totally valid to be upset with your family
except my mom and my brother
i dont have any living family left to ignore me
i felt super uncomfortable
but yeah
i move here
it talks about the aliens
and are talking
we already matched
i had some girl on tinder message me and 11 messages in shes already mentioned being on suicide watch, falsely put in jail and a rape vicitim
on a totally unrealted note
so anyway
the ps3 was saved by having a bluray player?
also the npc meme is kinda an extreme right wing dog whistle
I mean is it that bad that there isnt anime tiddys in the games?
i dont like eat bean or bean water
Feels bad
or like food?
like transit?
subway
maybe she just needed to vent
i mean idk what she was expecting
yeah
to her
have no clue how to repsond
i just
i mean idc
the good word of marx also leaves me owo
its okay comrade
uwu be a communist
I love her commics
a dull throbing
its like
so instead of constant agony from panic attacks
at least i can afford klonapan now
owell
yay
but instead I sell my soul and my health working a meaningless job to get money that doesnt even really exisit
I am lob everyone
same
everyones S tier now
well except the totally voluntary ones in the bedroom
no hierarchies!!

<:guillotine:549181743152758786>
and gotta get ready to go to therapy
cuz im tired af
i wont go too much into it
idk
ya
its just current money has so much more money than there can possibly be real world matieral wealth to back up
has been around for a long time
the idea of using something as a medium of trade
I mean barter economies never really exesisted for very long
its just a way for the rich to tell the poors how they have so much more "worth" than them
most of it doesnt even exisit
money is a scam
but money also has no real value
It's informally backed by oil and formally backed by a countries creditworthiness
Money isn't backed by gold any more
And a boob job ðŸ˜‚
Still gonna get vfs
But like eh
I get ma'am's on drive throughs like 70% of the time
XD
I gotta be mute to pass
I wish that were me
Omg
You can always pay to bypass tho
Wow tf is that spelling
6-12 months waiting list to start the tutorialore like it
<:blobcatscared:575406901420883988>

Luck 10 and get banned from all casinos
No hard feelings
I was overly hostile too
I was a neet who couldn't leave my house with out anxiety vommiting for a while!!

<a:headpats:488943068846751754>

Between us

<@235364641125957635> maybe Nara can teach you to use lotion
So I'm trying really hard at both
My only uses are talking and be prtty

I have really good skin too
Just gotta mositorize
You might get acane from hrt then
O rip

All my cis girl friends

I actually have the best hair out of all my friends when I'm doing the full high maintenance stuff
My hair is very thick and lucious
I'm like a real girl <:cry:551830021958926340>
It's like cis girl body hair
If I Nair my legs it can take up to 6 weeks before needing to shave again
I shave my arms and legs like 2-3 times a month
It thinned my bad hair so much too
Hrt is magic
<:noelHeart:550421652580728869> <:noelHeart:550421652580728869>
Ya
And it's varying amounts
Not everyone gets regrowth
Nini
<:NekoLove:481593141766520833>
Nah
Pfff
That's charisma
Streamer and YouTuber drama is insane
Lmao
Aged like milk

Oh my God
This is some shit
Damn
But I also don't really wanna talk about politics right now
Free housing/healthcare/education/food
And if we're already making those social changes why not keep going
It also would just keep funneling power into billionaries
Ubi sounds like hell in our current society tbh
Yeah but the vast majority of money is still taken by people who do no work
That's a problem of devs not being paid enough not VAs being over paid
Ya we talk a lot
So I guess that's a bias too know
My game dev friends/sources are also strongly pushing to unionize
I mean tbf I'm getting my info from game devs and what they've told me of their Dynamics
Then more crunch
So there's record profits and lay off
Most games make more than enough money to fund development, it's just investors keep demanding more and more and more of a cut
That something is the idea of infinete growth
hatsune miku invented minecraft
everyone knows
whos notch?
Taki said he was trying to change people's sexualities with money and she thought it was fucked
I read about the James Charles thing
But ya
I was more talking about the chucke2009 guy
The fuck
<:trans_heart:492057892422418452>
There are white nationalist in the us government who openly admit to it
He just hid it more back then
He was always a nazi-lite
That's not true
Socalism or barbaranism
It doesn't have to crash
Like fdr did
Time to pack the courts again
>>>>:(
tankies bad
but like also
tbf stalnist massively increased quality of life for Russian peasants and proles, literacy and food and houseing security where at the highest point ever  and the average russians diet was more calorie rich than the average americans
ily
Nara
its ableism
no more gamer jokes
i mean gaming disorder is a mental illness
are also mostly huge fucks
game dev company owners
yeah
!
if gamers care about games they should help unionize game devs
they will find someone new to burn out
and if they wont do the hours
cuz they want to do it
to work people to death
so its easy
video games also have an industry problem of people seeing it as a desireable dream job to chase
ya
I think its just two?
yeah but thats due to shareholder pressure to have higher and higher profits every year
when they arent working employees to death
and even then thats not a problem
rather tahn good
people want things that are safe
its just corprate culture is bad at making art in general
i think big budget games are fine
and are super fucking skeevy
loot boxes are also a way to sell gambling addicitions to children
ceos and share holders
(not for me, for work)
hes talking about moving to Atlanta too
gonna go tho
im
tbh
i just want a hug
Which is just a big oof
He also lives in Hawaii
<a:ablobthinking:468995798512959508>
So it's like
But like I really like this one boy
Like one or two boys
I just like
I'm a lesbian
Identity crisis time
And like
So I think I have a boyfriend now??
<:GhostDab:516729461295677440>
And still too anxious to work
I'm on 4 anti anxiety medications currently
about the girl im talking to
my bf knows
o ya
cuz shes busy â„¢
im not seeing her until july tho
ya ofc
so idk if it'll be a big problem
she has a bf too
with me having a bf?????????????????
I hope the girl I was talking to wont have a problem
And we really liked each other from there
He was just kinda around to talk to me at like 5 am
On the internet
Which is like <a:eyesshaking:563824776766816262>
He's taller than me too
Just the one boy
Ya
ty tho
not just anyone
i want a hug from theo
Kriisa?
Aren't you breaking rule one by vagueposting at someone?
I mean we really don't want people here if they hold wrong and harmful beliefs on gender
Nice vagueposting kriisa :)
Like you can't really reasonably moderate a community if you can't handle critisim at all
Like really kriisa should have been in this convo imo
Mods should be held to higher not lower standards
I do respect and value you as a person Melua
A line to far
Okay that's fair
I also remember before you started letting kriisa back into your life
I remembered last time a mod escalated on this server
Context is important
And not making offical annoucments attacking people
But I'm also not a mod
I'm not saying I'm doing the best here
I mean my personal issues with Kriisa aren't really a surprise :) she's been a cunt she's being a cunt and she'll keep being a cunt and I just enjoy calling her our for hypocrisy v
She also demands pleases and thank yous and sorrys for way more minor things
Besides kriisas personal issues with anyone pointing anything she does wrong?
What's so hard about that?
Why can't kriisa just admit she made a mistake and say sorry
I asked for an apology cuz I think it's rude af to vaguepost
I just don't see why a "I'm sorry for vagueposting about you" is so hard for kriisa to say
At the very least an apology for vague posting is deserved
I mean you should at least apologize for vagueposting, you didn't have to use Alice's exact words :)
It's also like a thing you have to do post srs for trans women
I was so confused when I got pinged and thought we were having the discourse over another insult
But this is the second time this stuff has come up here
Not trying to like personally attack or anything
Like gee thanks i already feel like garbage and responseable for my suffering and coming forward is hard enough with legal bs not to mention randos judging you on the internet or calling you a lair for no reason other than "skepticism"
And like as a survivor of sexual violence it feels super shitty to see people doubting vicitims constantly
Really makes you go ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”ðŸ¤”
He didn't get shot by the FBI till he started unionizing desegregated workers
And a socalist
MLK was actually cool as hell
That sounds right to me
Ya
Probably
Me saying throw a brick at a cop isn't systemic violence
Gotta wait like 10 more years for racial tension to rise enough for systemic police violence to be a problem
O y'all are in Europe
The only time cops get tried for murder is when their skin is darker than the person they shot
And good people who are cops get fired or murdered for going after their fellow cops for corruption
Good people don't become cops
Cops preform systemic violence against vulnerable people
Which makes you a bad person
I'd rather not talk about it but being a cop is a choice and by choosing to be a cop you implicitly support who they are and what they do
Is it bad that when a friend told me they were going to go to the police academy my first reaction was a pre appology for throwing rocks atthem
uwu
We should throw bricks at cops more
Idk just feels bad I just wanted to vent and instead had to justify
I mean my friend just said "damn uhaulers moving too fast" and like they've been dating their gf for like 5 years now and they only just moved in together and she was still worried it was too fast
Hence me being here
So I've been keeping it dl
He doesn't really want me talking about it with our friends yet either I don't think
I've spent the last 3 months w/ him tho and he is moving to my state for work anyway
But we're long distance currently
We'll be moving in together at like 8 monthsish
Said I was moving in too fast w/ my bf
And then talk to a friend aboot it and they judge u aboot it
Y'all every just be excited and anxious for something at the same time
If you don't feel comfortable telling your Dr about drug use don't lie to your doctor, get a new one
But weed can interact with issues that are being medicated, also tons of things can interact with meds like grapefruit juice can mess with dosing or things with activated charcoal will purge meds out of u 

Not to mention stuff like high doses of weed and lsd and shrooms can trigger psychosis in people who are already at risk for it
So like an addiction to gaming and weed is more or less the same thing cuz ur addicted to the dopeamine from the high
But ya substance addiction does have some dangers that other addictions don't but most addictions do hang around in the "entirely dopeamine addiction" side of things
Benzos can also kill you from the withdrawal
And how even if you don't and of and decide to get clean detoxing can kill you from being dope sick
Mostly due to how mellow it is in comparison to how dangerous it is and how quickly you can od and die
Herion is a way better example of something that's dangerous to try
I mean meth and coke are bad examples
I'm sorry that I misunderstood the situation ðŸ™ƒ my b
But if the rules are being broken and nothing being done they aren't really rules lol ðŸ™ƒ and if stuff is being done to handle the rule breakers it's not really different from other trolling
Like if I join a Ufo server and they don't have rules against bigotry I don't try and force ppl to change that I leave and go to a server that does actually deal with bigotry
It's like how on another server I'm on they banned politics but ppl really wanted to talk about politics so those ppl left bcuz the ppl voted and they changed things to ban politics so the mods started dealing with ppl breaking that rule
You said that a million times better than I could lol
But like idk if they wanna talk about that it should be done in a place with out kids there but like someone being a child and someone simply not liking something aren't the same when it comes to talking about stuff
I mean I agree with that too
Discord general servers are like group Twitter feeds more so than a "public space" like in a restaurant or a grocery store imo
Like internet spaces are entirely social constructs that are created by the ppl inside them, and if the majority of ppl are okay with something than you should just move on and find a better space imo
I agree with melua
Yumi gave you an actual example of how you can do things differently
No you just need to understand that things like tone of voice and body language are not present so you need to be more careful of word choice and stuff
Because talking over text and talking irl are not the same thing
I forgot to edit part of my comment
I think irl there's things like tone and body language
Ya lol
But also staying up all night, executive disfunction and freeze responses are also symptoms of PTSD
Teenagers ðŸ˜”
