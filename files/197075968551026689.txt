Would XDJii, the P Jii that cleanses poison and another lv70 do good in that raid? Not really sure what the best ways around raids are
Yeah i imagined lol, i do that one only for weekly
I'll focus on that one, thank you
Is there a raid that has a "better chance" at dropping giga melody?
and until then, you better pray rnjesus for drops <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

it's been too long x-x
memory is really hazy but the gist of it i think was that going there and seeing all those people selling their works made him feel really bad or something
i remember one of the founders(?) writing a post about how going personally to a comiket, i believe, changed his view on the entire thing
lol
kinda like steam if memory serves right?
"The way to beat piracy is to offer a better service than pirates do", or something like that?
people in japan were already being arrested for early uploads and the likes
all i'm understanding of this is that i should start looking into anti-radiation suits
how 'bout no <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
at some point they also banned Isekai stories from a contest in Japan <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

>this is "haha our industry is broken and driven by ego and greed"

reminds me about that part in Shirobako where they were choosing VAs for the anime. Boy that was triggering me more than i care to admit
thank you, cast
(except chu2, damn she's annoying)
so i just watched bang dream s2(the music is legit amazing holy) but the site i used did not have subs for the music, can anyone point me to somewhere where(can i even say this) the subs include the songs too?
i remember reading that for the anime Nana cut her hair and they had Ange's hair growth match Nana's, was that true?
cross ange was fuckin wild, i enjoyed it a lot
in the link for s2 it was mentioned that stoplight would do s3 too but who knows when. I was hoping there was some news on it
some songs were not subbed <.<
finished bandori s3, fuck that was good. Will there be a batch like the one i was linked on nyaa for s2?
