It's a curse T.T
After having my trust in others betrayed way too often, I kinda find it hard to form friendships with people again, even *if* they are genuine, kind and caring.
I can relate to that.
Kind of a strange comparison, considering I don't think I've ever heard people being assaulted or killed for celebrating Christmas... <:ThinkingIllya:482206340131848192>
You know, other than it being "annoying"?
I can kinda understand the dislike of the fact that corporations plant rainbow flags on their stuff, because I am 99% sure it's not out of solidarity to us but targeted marketing to make LGBT people think "Oh, they care about us, let's buy their products"... but that's an entirely different story altogether. Main thing I don't get is:
But what's wrong with expressing support of LGBT in general?
No idea where that trans-heart emoji is from, but I hope you won't mind if I steal it <:Please:335185707129765889>
Having supportive people around you both irl and online is an amazing thing indeed. May not be the most active member here, but I'm glad to have found this server and this community too~ <:NepYay:703951769796870174>
Ah, okay. Yeah, that doesn't sound as worrying then.
Unless I'm mistaken, in that case nevermind me
It kinda sounds like it's trans folks going HRT on their own without supervision/guidance from a medical expert.
I am really concerned about the implications of that name alone, ngl
The right is on the rise in many parts of Europe too, so wouldn't recommend moving here
Yes.
lol
All of the questions are imo
Now, I'm not an expert on mental health issues, but that kinda sounds like depression, Lec
Wouldn't be suprised if more shut down over time before the law goes into effect, simply because they don't want to take any risks
I am willing to bet you haven't.
I'm curious. Have you ever actually read Marx?
A small minority maybe, but they're growing in their influence. The fact that you yourself bought in to their propaganda at least partially by repeating their slogans and mantras is proof of that.
One last and kinda unrelated thing I wanna say is: thanks, everyone. 
Seen a fair bit of communities I cared about devolve into a right-wing circle jerk the past few years. Glad y'all are the way you are <3
... just hope this isn't out of place :<
Thank you, Ardania.
I'd love to hear an example of what you receive as white racism.
<a:HibikiHug:656221774240808960>
Weren't they also more soc/dem nowadays than actual communist ?
Cause I think that if enough people vote third parties, eventually people will have to take those third parties serious. So I do not understand what is wrong with that
I'm just hoping that enough dissatisfaction with the USA's two parties and the two-party system will eventually lead to enough third-party supporters that a multi-party election will be made possible.
<:happyhug:752643631289991200>
Personally, I wouldn't mind corporations in general being abolished. Why not, I dunno, just let the workers own the company assets they're working at?
And continue to be so because of that sweet lobbyist money
Not as long as governments are just corporate puppets
But when looking at the way the world is currently going, I fear like a natural, non-violent change starts to become less and less likely with every passing year.
Don't get me wrong, I'm not trying to push revolutionary ideals... at least not intentionally.
You really think the ruling class is gonna let democratic processes de-power them? They're gonna just be like "Okay then, we'll just move our company to another country and all the jobs along with it. Have fun explaining *that* to your voter base lmao" to whatever party/organisation that would try something like that.
The idea of a revolution is not a pretty one indeed, but is there even a possibility to topple the current system without one?
`Sometimes I wonder if it's possible to fix any of it?`
Not without a total collapse of the current ruling class' system, sadly.
Maybe you just need a change of scenery too, new people to surround yourself with, but eventually you're going to meet someone you'll find to have things in common with.
Being alone and feeling like it'll last forever sucks... but it won't last forever. Give it time.
Can't speak for others and only my own experience, of course, but I remember not getting into a relationship or even developing real friendships until after I finished school, moved away from my hometown and started working.
So I can kinda understand him getting mad
Why someone would bring a dog that is known to be bad with people into other people's house seems like a poor idea in the first place to me
<@!782841825069236236> <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
CoB was one of my favourite bands growing up, so hearing about this has me literally fucking crying right now
https://www.nme.com/news/music/children-of-bodoms-alexi-laiho-has-died-at-the-age-of-41-2848749
Starting to feel like 2020 was just the prologue and the real nightmare's starting now
Always interpreted ML as basically Stalinism without the cult of personality around a leadership figure, far removed from what the people of the October Revolution initially had in mind for their new socialist state
Removing statues your country doesn't want to be associated with anymore is nothing new, it's been done throughout history. Doesn't mean we forgot the people or the crimes they committed.
ngl, I actually agree with several of those being banned
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Here's hoping they're actually doing it. Good riddance
Same. Had my hopes up for a moment before noticing "Oh, it's just a translation of a Russian article. What a shame."
So basically, yes, it is still exploitation.
I disagree with the lottery, because whatever money a single "lucky" individual wins is still in the end taken from millions of other desperate people that buy tickets and not win anything, therefore no amount of winning justifies the gambling industry taking advantage of people's addiction, which is fueled by their desperation and (in 99,99% of cases) false hope of winning money to better their life situation.
What do you mean, "sometimes"? Don't people always get rich by either exploitation or simply inheriting wealth?
Yeah. In the end, the winner is still, in a way, taking advantage of a broken system, even if his intentions are not malicious.
So basically what I'm trying to say is, uh... don't bother with those kind of people, I guess?
Problem is also that most of the pro-Russia faction from what I've seen are simply hypicrotes who condemn everything the west does but just blindly parrot whatever propaganda they're fed when it's any "anti US" faction doing exactly the same thing they curse the west for.
Aside from the fact that no, Imperialist wars are bad no matter who does them. Cause here's a hot take: you can find both bad? 

Opposing any wars fought for the wealth of a capitalist elite does not mean supporting a war fought for the delusions of a fascist dictator, and vice-versa. And besides, "but X does it too" is just a bad argument to justify anything in general.
This country's a bloody joke
Welcome to German politics, where they really wanna be liked by the international community but also don't want their precious Russian oil and gas ~~bribes~~ money to stop coming, so they just shrug and say "but both sides are wrong lol"
While on the one side it *could* explain his increasingly erratic behaviour... yeah, I still have my doubts
Oh deer, what happened here?
Because they fear it won't sell as good if the name refers to whatever their current "enemies" are?
If you think you need a gun to defend yourself, then I'd say you're part of the problem.
If someone wants to hurt you, they'll find a way. Only difference in carrying a gun is the illusion of safety at the cost of a high risk of injuring or killing someone innocent.
Do you honestly think being able to get my hands on a weapon would've made me "safer", full knowing that if I can get one, pretty much anyone can ?
Well then, if you want a counter example, I never once felt unsafe in all the years I worked night shift. Mainly, or better entirely thanks to strict weapon regulations in my country.
All of 'em?
idk
Prosecute the Texan senator responsible for that for human rights violations?
Are they like actively trying to cause an armed uprising? At this point, I sure start to think that way
Only thing I could thinking while reading that article was capitalism flat out dropping its mask and admitting its system is built on exploitation. Who'd have guessed...
I kinda would mind very much.
I was gonna offer a reply, but after that... I refuse to even further interact with you Broom
Okay, I'm done.
Which is just *one* of the many things the Wehrmacht and Waffen SS did
So rounding up civilians in a building and setting that building on fire while they were laughing at the screaming was... better than what the soviets did?
<@722121666641133608>
Continuing from general:

Basically it means that a lot of European countries (like Germany, for instance) are heavily reliant on gas imports, the biggest one until recently being from Russia. Now with all the sanctions in place and no more cheap Russian gas, gas prices have been on the rise, which pisses off a lot of people, thus causing them to call to lift the sanctions so that they can have cheap gas again, for which they willingly align themselves with other rightist/pro-Putin/fascist circles. 

Cause apparently, human rights and innocent lives aren't that important anymore to some people once a minor inconvenience happens to their sheltered western lifestyles.
Best of luck, Armis
I can't even drive since I never got my licence, and dunno if I'll ever want to learn it either cause I can very well relate to the anxiety/irrational fear of having to be in control of a vehicle with my questional cognitive abilities that could cause severe damage if driven by someone with exactly such an impairment.
It means twitter's going to openly accept far-right view points while censoring leftist ones or anything critical of Elon.
So... save the planet, kill the rich? 

What are we still waiting for? :)
Alright. Gonna add those to my to-watch list and then see which one to start with. Thanks <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I know the franchise is massive, so which series would you suggest to start with?

are my 3 favorites`
<:KananOfCulture:396858299607416863>
*cries in European*
ngl, seeing people talk about Higurashi kinda makes me want to rewatch the show... or maybe finally read the VNs.
<:KokoroNaruhodo:644846571111972864>
Oh, you're in season 2 already?
<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
Higurashi is a cute, wholesome and heartwarming slice of life comedy where nothing bad ever happens.
Enjoy the ride ^.^
<:wowRuby:585600371146096659>
Damn, I had no idea
And yes, that bit was indeed intentional <:NepWink:475053855516917763>
Hey, one of the main characters is called Cure Black, doesn't get much darker than black :^)
Nanoha has some dark themes over its course, but I wouldn't call it a dark magical girl series overall.

Either way, have fun :>
Does Bandori count as idol hell? <:ChrisThinking:738120822006218836>
idk, I love all the bands, so I don't mind the others getting some spotlight as well
Granted, seasons 2 and 3 heavily featuring ||RAS|| might have made me a little biased, but still thought the overall quality was better.
I always thought the first season was the weakest one, with the other two gradually improving
People hate season 2? What?
<:KaoruBrag:432993170486329364>
Hakanai~
<:KokoroJii:585567196374368277>

<:PareoJii:720504577673265232>
<:SetsunaOfCulture:588945049694502924>
So you are forgiven for not watching Love Live yet
Bandori and IMAS are good civ
Haven't gotten to finish Rayearth yet, but so far: loved every moment of it. Fun, wholesome characters, neat fantasy elements and for some reason I got hit heavily by nostalgia while watching despite only recently starting to watch it.
<:ArtoriaSparkle:592493992638152705>
Rayearth talk?
Pretty sure I will :>
Was hopeful for a moment there too, but alas... not available in my region.
Is EX-ARM another case of so bad it's good, or is it just bad?
<a:illyaPanic:393811760273948673>
<:kasuShrug:601671460150444042>
The anime doesn't do her character justice, she's better in the game~
is a popular argument that I cannot confirm nor deny because the game's in Japanese only and I don't speak Japanese
<:screamsinternally:422248764581871616>
With nothing bad or sad ever happening. Eveeeer.
Yuki Yuna is a perfectly normal magical girls show about cute girls protecting the world.
<:AkoSparkle:648743118400651294>
First new Madoka, now new Yuki Yuna?
https://i.imgur.com/1KQQcqB.jpeg
<:NitoOfCulture:352569513989898253>
Yeah. Didn't really like Umi at first tbh, but she's grown on me a lot over the course of the series.
Also, Hikaru best girl. :>
<:LockBliss:824830646571499562>
Took a while, but I finally finished the first season of Rayearth. 

Despite usually not liking isekais or mecha, this was a most enjoyable ride despite the outdated animation. Loved the characters, the setting, the old school fantasy-feeling that almost made me feel a strange sense of nostalgia. ||Ending was a lot sadder than I thought too. Did not see the twist coming.||
That being said, off to season two now~
Okay, but... second season of Niji when? D=
<a:RenaHauuuuu:692410049221361664>
Watch Higurashi
<:SayoBruh:432993341827710976>
~~Still haven't watched the movie~~
Season 2 Aoi Yuuki Committing War Crimes? Count me in~
Some might also argue that one should start with Heartcatch since it's apparently the most popular/well liked one. 

Or you could just jump into the currently airing one, which is also a pretty enjoyable one so far and since it's ongoing doesn't have as many episodes out yet, so the task of watching them all is not as high :D
I feel like starting with Futari Wa is a good choice, cause it's not just the very first, but also a good season in general.
<:Sigh:335185734258655233>
And yeah, that's fair. It was admittedly kinda difficult for me to enjoy Suite simply because of way too high expectations after watching Heartcatch
<:Yahane:356677867138056195>
Yohane!
<:RinaPanic:748591238323765478>
Liked what I've seen so far. And as someone who is terrible at drawing, can relate to Kaos too.
<:CasterDetermined:339521029594415104>
<@!171395487247630336> I'm doing it. Finally started watching Comic Girls.
<:happy:319324047064301568>
Didn't expect a Tropical Rouge crossover movie to be with Heartcatch, hey, I welcome any Laura and Erika moment we'll get
Way too high IQ for me <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Yeah. I'm not going to trashtalk it, since I'm pretty sure that it's a well made show for the people who are able to follow and appreciate it, but it just... wasn't for me.
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
`I think one thing that turns most people off from Lain is its pacing
And just the fact that it is very confusing.`

Yep. Tried to watch Serial Experiment Lain a couple of years ago. Dropped it after just a couple of episodes of being unable to understand wtf is going on.
<:aiConsiderThis:476659384118804480>
<:SetsunaOfCulture:588945049694502924>
<:PhosBruh:720542011890991104>
And just checked. Hokuto no Ken aired two years before the original Dragon Ball, so *that* is my oldest watched boomer anime as of now.
<:YuuHyped:762379673816530984>
<:ChrisThinking:738120822006218836>
I'm not even sure what the oldest Boomer anime on my list is. If I had to guess, I'd say the original Dragon Ball?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
But hey, at least being a boomer gives me the power to enjoy boomer anime~
<a:AquaCryGif:438206135162503178>
Okay, not as long back as I thought it was, so... feeling slightly less old now.
2016
<a:mariSp00ked:493210620225781772>
For me it was Sunshine.... why do I feel old all of a sudden?
<:JeanneSmug:634675638372007947>
Just Type Moon character design~
Do it.
Uh... you mean Lock?
<:JeanneSmug:634675638372007947>
Shouldn't we ~~thank~~ blame Urobuchi for making Jeanne a Saberface however, since I thought he started it with ||Gilles mistaking Artoria for Jeanne in Zero||?
<:MHXthink:368929065958113281>
And I always thought Arc was the original Saberface, especially considering the coincidentally blonde hair
<:ArcherHeh:335185805930790914>
Give 'em a couple of years, Takeuchi finds a way
Yet.
<https://fategrandorder.fandom.com/wiki/Artoria_Caster>
<:SaberLion:335185588875689986>
Why would they do that?
They already have Saber as every class after all
<:Sigh:335185734258655233>
as opposed to all these dark and edgy MS stuff that they're putting out nowadays
is more typical/classic magical girl shows
One thing I'd like to see
Felt like things would've had more of an impact in that case
Yeah, I'm part of the Zero first crowd, thanks to my friend's recommendation. Still ended up reading the VN afterwards, but honestly kinda wish I did it the other way around
<:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
But good to know~
Interesting. Had no idea since I only got into Fate when it was already a big thing, so not being spoilered as to the identity of the Servants was simply not possible.
<:ChrisThinking:738120822006218836>
Didn't watch Blue Reflection yet, so I cannot comment
<:MHXthink:368929065958113281>
<:arisu:288176404716322816>
Never watched the Hibike movie, but thought about watching it. Oh well, good to know she ends up with a guy after all, saves me an hour and a half of time and disappointment now.
<:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
Eh, f*** the moon.
I see.
Nothing to add to the Plan To Watch list then :P

I think you got your yuri wrong. I'm a fangirl, not a Gagarin.

I'm going to spess ?
<a:HibikiWarCry:613117025501446144>
Well, you can never go wrong with Heartcatch. It's the most popular one for a reason~
<:SparkleNep:619238929706778664>
A comf movie?
<:RanWoke:585578277758828552>
CaRdGaMeS oN mOtOrCyClEs
<:arisu:288176404716322816>
Finished Aquatope now too.

Dunno what to feel about it tbh. Expected more ||gay. Not even a last minute love confession between Kukuru and Fuuka, just more bait? Please...||
Kircheis... keep us up to date Iskie, wanna know if a Klosterwaffeln will appear in that anime too~
<:Chu2Doubt:815553742241136670>
Don't quote me on that however, haven't actually watched it
So basically Valkyrie Drive ?
Good yuri anime indeed.
<:SetsunaOfCulture:588945049694502924>
<:Chu2Pog:585602411947622401>
<:LockBliss:824830646571499562>
Season 2 and 3 have RAS in it, that alone makes it worth watching.
Do eet
There are 2 movies about Roselia, but I haven't watched either yet so I cannot comment about them.
After season one you continue with the much superior seasons 2 and 3
<:KokoroJii:585567196374368277>
In that case, the answer to what that was is simple~
was that the HHW episode ?
Uh...
so plenty of content
Well, starting next week it'll be 19 seasons technically
Yeah.
If you want Magical Girls, watch Precure~
<:NanohaThinking:525906816689766411>
Otherwise, if you haven't watched them yet, will always recommend Nanoha or Yuuki Yuuna.
<a:YohaneOfCulture:460724968205058048>
I see Bloom Into You, MMO Junkie and Flip Flappers. Lank confirmed individual of culture.
<:LanzhuThink:892856065719406592>
Tempted to add Comic Girls to the list too however
That's easy:
<a:RinaPanicHarder:748799238695288866>
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Still my favourite Nana song/OP to this day.
Still wanna catch up on Tropical Rouge first since I have a couple of episodes of that left, but I def. plan to

~~Team Jobbers unite~~
I still haven't even finished the first season D:
<:RinaBoxPeek:702820329793519716>
From that visual I assume/hope it'll be a little bit more focused on the drama aspects, as compared to the original which was...uh.... kinda all over the place?
Thank you, Iskie
<:SparkleNep:619238929706778664>
Season 2 of Niji started airing already? Damn.
No.
<:anya:356706099468173312>
Goddamnit Maple
Oh, already exists too.
<:UmiGay:849480481836630047>
Plot twist: the MC is a girl too, making it gay and thus saving Isekai.
Or how about the classic "I went to another world but instead of becoming a hero I got wasted with a bunch of dwarves and now I don't know where tf I am and everyone's mad at me"
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I'm still waiting for the obligatory "I went to another world and all I got was this lousy t-shirt" Isekai
ngl, looks like an attempt at If Kanade was a Girls und Panzer character
<:Arc:438098624539262990>
*and that's why we need a Tsuki anime*
then I don't have it
cause if it's any like FSN where you get the best ending of first route only by finishing all the other routes
Think it was the normal one
Been too long
I don't remember.
idk, I only finished the Arc route before my old PC went do ded and I haven't been able to read the other ones
Or do it like Stay Night and just do all routes.
<:MHXthink:368929065958113281>
I wonder if they ever made a, say, Tsukihime anime, if that one would wound up being a bad adaptation too.
Only seen the KNK movies, never read it.
Just askin'
I dunno, I never read Hollow Ataxia or how it's called
How would that even work? Like, Saber being present ||despite disappearing into nowhere in UBW, being sent back to medieval England in Fate, and being killed in the grail cave in HF|| ?
Wasn't Nasu's version of cohesion always "All endings are canon, all routes are canon, they're just different timelines"?
Is it an eyesore?
<a:oryoupeace:718679937803878420>
it's way too late, so I'm out
Anyway
despite their... uh... tendency to make things more complicated than necessary
But they're to this day still my favourite of Nasu's works
Watched the Niji episode now too. ||So many good Kasu moments||, loved it
<:ChrisSing:586715673359679488>
An anime with characters random breaking into song? Now I'm curious...

Sad Rocks The Animation
They turned what would've been a below-average horror anime into a meme, and it was glorious.
<a:HyperKasumiYays:585574711036084229>
Yeah, ||Carl's|| a pretty good character. I do wonder however if they'll ever reveal his true name on the anime
In either case, 't was a fun watch and I look forward to season.3 whenever that's out
Yeah, ||Lina going full noob and dying to neutrals was a disappointment||. I'm also not sure if ||Mirana being a southern princess || was part of the game's lore or did the anime make that up ?
I know, I finally watched both seasons.
<a:YAMERO:585563118080491530>
Not if Valve wants yet another lawsuit from Blizzard
<:ThinkingSelly:603560167115587601>
<:Gudako:335187479680253955>
That does look pretty gay. Consider me interested
<a:RinaShiftyEyes:759679926495739904>
Just hope the LL isekai won't end up like a certain other idol franchise that tried to make a mecha-spin off that fans of the main series somehow refuse to acknowledge as even existing
As long as it's good... yay?
Let's just hope that the anime adaptation won't take several years again
Alternatively, another Vivid Strike season, would be happy about that as well
||https://tenor.com/view/pucci-heaven-intensifies-jojo-bizarre-adventure-enrico-pucci-gif-18172907||
||And it's all downhill from here on out.||
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:EliCry:731393148739387454>
But I genuinely like Niji. Unlike Superstar...
<:KasuPoint:527028489128247297>
Yeah, what Ash said
<:KaosSmile:444571001083396107>
Yes, that's Kaos from the deep philosophical masterpiece about the artistic creation process that is Comic Girls.
Don't get me wrong, a Nier anime seems nice and all, but... Drakengard 4 when
That's putting it... very mildly
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Not just any polar bear, a polar bear in love~
I want them!

And it's airing?
<:WhiteEhhh:890518026737303563>
<a:ErikaGlasses:890044899045556254>
That said, on to Go! Princess~
I finally did it. I finally finished Happiness Charge. Took me a while since I actually needed breaks from the show every now and then. 
Easily weakest PreCure season.
<a:2BDead:756001908916748448>

Speaking of "arab" metal, Cypher... do you know Orphaned Land? :
<:SmugAoko:528571502627389440>
Nope. I'm old-fashioned enough to want a physical copy
<:akarishrug:587026329183191040>
I would be, but I sadly cannot get it until payday anyway, so I'm pretending it just isn't out yet
Dunno if I'd use terminal, but it scheint auf jeden Fall to be beyond fortgeschritten.
If that Lied still counts as Denglisch, I would say that's the highest Stufe of it.

Depends on the style of Symphonic Metal for me. It's either a hit or a miss, have yet to listen to something from that genre that makes me say "it's alright I guess".
Majestica's blend of Symphonic/Power Metal for instance? That's a clear hit~

As a long time fan of idol anime all I can say is: yes. Yes it does.

Chrismas music?
