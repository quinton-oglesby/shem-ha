petition for Saki to not check discord while driving at 70mph
ulterior motives
but is an interesting idea

<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
I can post my collection when i finally get a display case...
same
hopefully next month
i need to get my case...
you may need a shipping forwarder for yahoo auctions
probably
amazon.jp
it's really good
yeah that's a famous figure
im just saying
lol
they don't sell broken shit
if book off it's probably fine tbh
wait this is at book off?
if it was from an offical reseller like amiami i'd trust it
also that price actually seems waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay low for that fig
whats the problem
that looks cool
but ok
that looks rather offical for being handmade
unpainted
that's just a prototype model
I've had to cancel an order once a while back...fortunately they didn't ban me
you have to email them specifically to get something maybe canceled
no
yeah it's very rude
lol didn't read up
oh
so they have leftover stock
it's usually only if someone prerodered a thing but didn't actually pay
amiami restocking anything is extremely rare
omg "add noise"
so much Edge

<:GWnanamiCoconaSweat:402866237853401100>
i need more edgy hibiki
found it
https://twitter.com/oonamuamidabutu
artist for those first 2?
What is wrong with her face lol
isn't the recoil on that thing huge
watching ep 1 now
who?
I hae a Yuuki figure at least
not after the only character i like in the entire series died from fucking AIDS
oh üöÆ
GGO?
Upotte is a anime/manga
are we talking about Girls Frontline or Upotte
are her tits too big?
lol
she probably has better aim than me
Colt-chan is cute too https://en.gfwiki.com/images/thumb/4/43/Colt_Revolver.png/420px-Colt_Revolver.png
maybe becuase it didn't trigger my undying hatred of kirito or maybe cuz mc is a cute loli
GGO is alright
I mean it sounds hard to control if you have 2 of them
DRAGON CHRIST I WANT It

we need Miku gacha then <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
that's hell of a crossover
lol wtf
Is captain planet her stand
is hibiki supposed to be a wolf
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
manly bikki is gross
what ep was that
what the fuck
i didn't know it was possible to look edgy while wearing a santa outfit
what are those kinds of socks even called
why can't this be me https://twitter.com/hairaito78/status/989832810696331265
Lol ok
I never got an answer on what those socks are. Also so much K-On <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>



everything i have would be a repost here <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
I thought Hibiki was the sunshine <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
I approve
that miku with the stuffed animal looks vaugely yandere
adult elfnien <:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
sakura trick has girls kissing in EVERY episode though
Kumiko x Reina üëå

some very strange perspective in that pic
well using the power of the sword of murder is edgy
they changed after getting fixed in GW didn't they
too real



what about Hibiki Hibiki <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>

Nakayoshi
>Take a bath together > sleep together


enlisted Miku to help AU miku and Hibiki get along
need that tragic backstory to become a hero

DMJii is criminally underrepresented in fanart though <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>

Shirabe would be the responsible one who makes sure they don't all crash the ship

really? Well i have him NP5 lol
oh him
which gudaguda
who?
is he? He's a 3*
I never actually rolled him, and i still need an avenger..
Gudao/ko too stronk
pretty much all of them are evil
Avenger is a class for people who despise humanity or something similar

I'm not a huge fan of mama either but i like her uniform outfit in the lancer form
lol
~~really good~~ --> fucking busted
lmao
like MHXA
id use a berserker over Artoria
but i have okita and Saberlot so who the fuck would use her
I have artoria too
at least i got malter while trying to roll for Mama lancer...
and my fucking NP5 Emiya
I complusively keep servents i dont even use like Nero and Rama
The only gold servent I've ever burned is Stheno cuz she's fucking useless lol
At least Juliet is happy
But also silly
I mean it was obvious
the plot twist on that mystery was silly
I have all of them NP5
you'll pretty much get every 3* and under eventaully
eurayle is 3* so you'll get her anyway
i think? I don't remember lol
she's free yes
Euryale is good
wot
I pretty much don't have to worry/care about what i roll anymore.
I've just been playing for like 2 years so i have tons of servents
it's exactly the same

indeed.

<@173112001684439040> do you like Jack?
even named the file lol
this some high quality shitposting
lol
I figured sparkle made it
ü§î
CC?
I'd roll for BB Carol
I assume that Adam is supposed to be Ryoma
oh geez
but the way it lines up
yeah
golden nabe is crazy
that is such a specific reference lol
yea
oh wow
drawing a blank
uhhh
I don't think Hibiki knows how to use those eyes
oh no
Persona
Thantos?
give me Alter
seen that already
she gonna get befriended
maid in abyss kek
it's literally a screenshot from the last ep
Shinobu is best
it's hentai
only 770 episodes
edgebikki flashbacks
oh someone made that spread into one image, nice
the BGM during the transformation is fantastic
Radiant Force, Glorious Break, Duo Shout, the first half of Axia no kaze, rainbow memoria
uh mine is a bunch of different ones
genocide
Kimi dake ni is nice
nvm
too big for me
and shenshoujing was entirely erased ~~until they decide to retcon that somehow kappa~~
cuz it's a good song
it's online lol...
well they had to go to a parallel universe to get SSJ back in XDU...cuz you apparently can't find more fragments of any gears...
don't think to hard about it <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
or something
the mirror itself isn't pure, probably
it's a mirror that reflects purity?
impressive how much they actually were able to back corporate though
well there is absolutely no way they planned out that reveal about SSJ also erasing Hibiki and Miku's sin back during G
the entire plot is rather obviously written in a way that they thought about things later and found some bs way to incorporate it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
they seem to be bringing everything back for this season...who knows
literally the only reason Gen couldn't just fight himself is cuz he doesn't have protection from the gear <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
and threw them back
he caught missiles out of the air
I mean that's the drug's entire purpose
Kanade straight up dies using zessho, Kirika uses it, is fine after one episode <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I highly doubt anyone is actually gonna die
well considering all the fake character deaths the series keeps having...
!!mfw I don't like either of them!!
Kirika got off scott free last season, doubt anyone is gonna die this
it would already make sense for gunnir to have god killing properties, them shoving in that stuff about Longinus was kinda pointless
as far as the money thing, they very obviously push merch hard. And it's really not even that hard to market considering the design of the show has insert songs like every episode.
I'm just saying if someone actually dies after the nonsense they pulled with Kirika, it's not gonna be very impactful to me
okay
both Serena and Kanade were designed to die. All the others are basically immortal
I just wanna see the 10 sec they had to cut for time
and a lot of people watch for the ecchi so it really just depends on the person...
half of their battle outfits are transparent, it's not like ecchi or lewd is anything new
like what...
I mean the Kirika one also had callbacks, like I assume they all are going to have
I'm pretty sure the 10 secs were just cut because of time
it was like a 45 second transformation...and it did have personality in it
I wanna see those sick yoyo moves next week

~~and then Ver shows up and stabs Miku in the back~~
and shirabe's comes out in a few days
CD was stocked a day early
"the song in my heart lets me sing underwater" <:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
I'm ready for miku to finally do something after 2 seasons
what the fuck
as if you didn't expect Fudou to be swole
dark times when symphogear can only be found on the dark web <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
VPN?
welcome to the mega death party
it's like a plague
amused more like
why am i reading this
this is some cheating ass bullshit
my brain hurts
what the fuck kind of relic is Truth Seeker supposed to be
WWIII, japan vs **everyone**
Carol just wanted to watch the world burn
just like Nanoha, you have to befriend every girl you beat the shit out of
what if the minotaur escaped since it was destroyed
the labyrinth thing reminded me of something from index like I told Cypher lol
like Maka's scythe
I thought they were gonna take the Chris Taxi to the moon though
the magic transformation ground
inb4 Fudou already has Miku kidnapped
~~the monster was in our hearts all along~~
and not enough screen time
the 2nd song in the CD
ova makes the most sense
I was just talking to a bunch of friends in voice i hadn't talked to in a while and im tired as hell
how much sex are they having <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
no one alive now was responsible the interment camps, blaming desendents for it is absurd.
da-to-shi-te-mo
„Å†„Å®„Åó„Å¶„ÇÇ
I know none of my friends would really care if I were to do something like that but I dunno about yours.
I mean it's one thing if they know you and you don't mind...but this is clearly not the case here
sound like bad friends
cuz that seems very random to just be asking...
you "friend's" discord <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
lol what...
good
lmao
I need a haircut...
no one can look as good as maria
particularly other people's organs
~~I heard organs are worth a lot~~
<:GWnanamiKonataThumbsUp:405043486237392896>
it's good
I was gonna mention that
lol
oh that
cool
that's a lot of porn comics <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
I remember it a few times
beyond "popular bitch"
cuz Trixie actaully has character developtment in it
the tammantha eps are actually really good
it needs to die
it's still airing and it got baaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaad later on
well w/e, moving on
Kim possible was trash??????? WHAT
I mean they are progressing passed phones. That's why ubereats and grubhub exist
same...
really
I never call in orders
can't you just order everything online nowdays
i dunno your area so no idea at this point
I want food now

alternatively, something that's not psychotic to make though lol

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
i mean harassing your mom
wtf...
lol what...who does that
<:GWnanamiKonataThumbsUp:405043486237392896>
my situation is different cuz I haven't seen the person in years but I kinda just said there's nothing I can do and forgot about it
You can either suck it up and actually ask to talk about it. Or forget about it. Doing the inbetween option is clearly not helping you.
oh...
oh you still interact with them?
so yes for me
I had a friend stop talking to me for (apparently) no reason a few years ago. At first I was quite confused and kept texting him wtf was going on and he would never respond so I stopped trying. I would think about him every now and then until eventaully at some point I kinda just forgot about him.
it's annoying more than anything whenever it happens to me
having to wait it out
literally sitting there knowing nothing is there but can't move cuz of chemicals
sleep paralysis sucks ass, i dunno why you would want to do it intentionally
uh which
CS is more likely to have job opportunities honestly...
good
any time im lucid in dream i almost immidatley wake up
lol yeah...
what is wrong with em
im playing mahjong ranked while drunk
he's missing out
who doesn't like yuri <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
what kind of degenerate stuff did he see <:Ver:336656981144109066>
oh he say YOUR porn lmao
why is that bad
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD:_Dream_Emulator
have any of you played LSD
cuz i just have to wait for it to wear off
every time i've had sleep paralyisis it's more annoying than scary
because they're hazy
in general, fine details tend to not be represented properly in dreams
it's always a feeling of something behind me that i know for a fact isn't real but is annoying cuz i can't psycically move
never had those
every time i've had sleep para is when my back is facing the door for some reason on that note...
if they're gonna be that way, you shouldn't be friends with them
theres all sorts of random scholarships
did what
would you
she's fine now I think, hopefully
lol
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

Hollow Knight is fucking amazing
ganbatte

Mitsuya is really far from me...
pretty sure ibu was joking...
cuz he's coming here to the fair
it was saki
cool
among other stuff
cheescake resturant
exactly what it sounds like
well i like a dress wtih a feathery cloak
male and female assassin in GBF https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gbf/images/a/af/260201_kn_0_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20160211082402&path-prefix=th https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/gbf/images/6/6b/260201_kn_1_01.png/revision/latest?cb=20160211082420&path-prefix=th
and dresses and skirts
still better than generic armor #3 for male characters imo....
even in like pokemon the female clothing is way better
I mean I'm serious...
and female clothing is almost always better/more varied in literally any game ever
kids are dicks, nothing gonna change that
i was bullyed until 7th grade cuz school i went to was shit. Transfered to another school with nice kids for 8th and never had problems in HS
elementry schoolers are dicks, what a shock
I was called she once IRL by a waitress cuz i had long hair at the time lol...
Well yours doesn't really say one way or the other yeah
I don't think it's necessary as long as it's clear you're a girl
geez
that is the most baffling thing I've heard lol
lol what???????
good
lol
people have psychical porn?
I would be beyond mad if that happened but my mom would never do something like that
great...
oh she's one of those...
as long are you're not driving like you're drunk
speed limit is "60" but no one gonna care if you drive 70ish
Saki you're driving <:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
i enjoy meta things like that but i felt DDLC was trying a little hard
I don't even think it was that good tbh but im a huge horror game buff
it is not the game or the game dev's fault that this person unfortunately killed himself.  Most people don't kill themelseves after playing a video game.
it's a game not intended for children that has a mature content warning literally at the beginning. I hate the shit about blaming the game for things like this
oh that thing
The Grey Garden and stuff
like IB, the witch's house and stuff
I was really into the rpg maker horror games
i hate those kind of horror
oh...
or just cuz ddlc was the latest meme
our of curiousity do you play horror games normallly
I also really enjoyed Da Capo series
like Kamidori
understanble but I've played a fair share of good ones
does Dan critizies like porn focused VNs or whatever?
and completely ruined it for me lol
I like meta stuff but the first thing i thought of was that other VN i linked when it did that
it reminded me a lot of other VNs that i liked lol
anyway i didn't really like DDLC for various reasons not least of which it feeling a lot like another meme game
I mean games like KEY's VNs encourage doing every ending and they're often quite different
which is fine but is probably why I'm not really taking what he says seriously
I feel like me and dan have a fundamentaly different understanding of VNs
??? Diferent endings breaks immersion?
I don't see why that's something to make a big deal about when literally you're goal wouold be to see all the endings. Espcially with games like 999 or Ever17
well i guess thats' why i didn't really like it
I don't know why you wouldn't save to mke sure you get the ending you want
calling it criticism makes it sound like it's a bad thing
becasue i wanna see all the endings
I mean I do that....
that literally defeats the whole point of it being a VN
??? Who hacks a VN?
whats wrong with that
but i know everything that happens cuz of memes and everyone who wont stop talking about it
I actually never finished it cuz i got bored...
anyway we need better metal health faciliities in US like usual
also I had played this before it and it executed the concept better https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oXcwYgoGR0E
the doctor get back to you?
it's not really the horror aspect i like sometimes but the characters involved. The the despair of bad things happening to them.
and soul crushing
also Corpse Party is classic
also i like RPG maker games in general cuz of one of my favorite youtubers
I was more refering to something like this which bothers me. I flat out do not agree.
http://pm1.narvii.com/6407/0f679c7bbe306b8ea690953ee8dbe2e200b3d124_00.jpg
moved from <#337805317276565525>
Unless something is blantly offensive for some reason then it shouldn't be changed. And Yamato Nedeshiko is hardly offensive even if it is a bit of an outdated thing. Some translations change things that really don't need to or shouldn't be changed imo.
I was refering to Kerrik implying that it shouldn't be allowed in comedy, with my reply, which I don't  agree with.
I can agree to not say any slurs or whatever you don't want being said on this server cuz those are the rules, but I'm not just gonna sit here while someone trying to shame(?) me for not agreeing that it is/should be a slur.  Anyway w/e, guess this conversation ended and I have to sleep.
...
I mean,  at least I really don't think taking shrooms or drugs that `permanently alter your mind` to `try` and cure depression or anxiety is a risk that is worth taking.
the UN is becoming a joke
well they can't force anyone not in the UN to agree. And Japan is not gonna give a shit at the very least lol
I highly doubt this is gonna go anywhere though
and there's already been tons of correlations with the rise of loli art actually decreasing the amount of real crimes
I mean it literally is a mental disorder...
the DOA6 stream was less sexual than actual titty streamers
If i'm gonna play $60 for a game I don't want content removed from it
no censorship is fine
http://www.vgchartz.com/article/393281/sony-starts-to-censor-sexual-content-in-japan/
and looks fucking stupid
it's pretty absurd
http://www.vgchartz.com/articles_media/images/nora-to-kojo-ps4-1.jpg  http://www.vgchartz.com/articles_media/images/ergerger5g-1.png
they did this https://nintendosoup.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/IMG_0661.jpg
I also hate censorship
yeah it's a pointless law
pretty much
it's illegal in Korea but I see like a billion korean translated doujins on exhentai lmao
depending on your country
no one will enforce it, authorizes have enough problems dealing with actual cyber criminals already
didn't get either
I wanted Valentine Melissa too
gimmie
üó°
Valatenine?
which waifu
blizzard, bethesda, bungie all went to shit
this timeline is weird
they still put crazy microtransactions in it but somehow the game is great
EA is just publishers
it's not EA, it's Respawn
something went wrong here
we're in a timeline that ninendo has more sexual content than sony
I feel bad for the annoucers at EVO who had to pretend they agreed with the stream being taken down too
oh you know the people in japan didn't give a fuck, it was entirely the english audience that got the stream taken down
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
it's the company's fault for not labeling the game as something for Mature audience-oh wait
oh loot boxes and gacha have no place in actual games
yeah this looks like shit lol https://news.qoo-app.com/en/post/27187/%5BAJ+2018%5D+Mobile+game+Monogatari+Series+Pucpuc+is+set+for+2018+Summer+release
it's probably bad
there is?
if there was a bakemonogatari gacha I'd be dead lel
oh they absolutely capitlize on people with extra income. Whales are what make them thrieve
wow even more of a scumbag
he gets away with it cuz he says he has autism and people are too afraid of being called discriminatory
I absolutely loath people like that
yeah, that's good. I've run into people like that before though...
I really wouldn't try and use some kind of condition that might not exist as an excuse. Even if you do have one you're gonna have to figure out how to deal with it at some point. Sorry if this comes off as rude.
I don't really lash out at all anymore
I also happen to have Aspergers but it's rather mild and I never try and use that as an excuse for anything
I used to have anger issues in, partially do to bullying and stuff, until at some point in highschool I realized that the bullies are idiots and just didn't care what they do or just talked back to them like they're dumb.
and see what they consider borderlind
pain in the ass, wish they would just stop
well now I have to go make sure who im following on pixiv
they were already that, at least they're being honest about it now
i mean it is based on how they look
literally the only reason i use twitter is to follow artists
probably
I sure hope you're vaccinated too
whew
Reality sucks, not everyone is a nice person.
I mean she still sounds like a bitch
tell them to fuck off, that's not something a actual friend would say seriously
"You're a pervert for having a problem with censorship" get the fuck out of here
what the fuck
red flags is an understatement
Old Man Dante
I had to leave in the middle of the conversation but yeah I agree I would just get a refund and forget about her
Well only an idiot would think he actually condones something like that. God fuck that guy though.
that was so stupid
if I lived in the UK I probably would have voted remain but to claim there is literally `zero` legitmate reason for people wanting to leave is kinda I dunno
so the people who actually wanted to leave...not supposed to vote to leave cuz of some racist ad?
thing insane name calling match is why nothing in politics ever gets done
```The UK's EU membership fee. The UK pays more into the EU budget than it gets back. In 2017 the UK government paid ¬£13 billion to the EU budget, and EU spending on the UK was forecast to be ¬£4 billion. So the UK's 'net contribution' was estimated at nearly ¬£9 billion.``` looks like a legitimate reason to me. Not that I particular care
MugiVision is the ultima form of yuri goggles
shots fired
lol
Love Live is also good . The first Idolmaster is fun, didn't care about Cinarella Girls
Just watch them all
I liked Frontier and Delta üó°
None of them are really required for each other. Except maybe 7
<@!388516680742993933> watch Macross
Too bad it's never getting continued cuz author disappeared
Noooo Black Bullet. Dont let him trick you into suffering
I'd watch Girls und panzer
Rebellion is so good
I want more Girls und Panzer
things just make sense when you watch it...
there's just a few arcs that are flashfowards
the order is already mostly chronological
it's really not...
cuz there are reveals in flashbacks
Monogatari
This
chronological will just fuck you up cuz you'll know info you're not supposed to know yet
like the haruhi people who say to watch in the weird ass order
all those otehr people are being elistist
the watch order is order of release
boi what?? I just gave you the order they go in
in that order

with season 1
<:GWnanamiHanekaWhat:399930848914440192>
what similar reasons
<:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
WHAT
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

I don't know why this was linked here but I'm saving it
but oh well
i actually really like the parts that aren't fanservice and wish it didn't have as much tbh
we can watch some Strike Witches. Haven't watched that in ages XD
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
also i dont really rewatch anime unless i haven't seen it in a very long time so
Saki maybe
also I dunno what anyone else would be interested in watching
wasn't a fan
they're the biggest disgrace i've ever seen
lol
who the fuck supports 4kids
what do you mean you won't lie
lmao
>Shingeki no kyojin
tbh
just read the manga
or 23 whatever the actual number is
30 minutes
so it's 94
also i counted them as 30 minute episode chunks
owari's are the entire arc in one episode
NONE of which are filler
monogatari is 94 episodes and 3 movies
btw even if you don't watch it, go listen to the music, they're all great
but it's verrrrrrrrrrrry long
I can put it there

he's actually not that bad in the new one shockingly
~~literally the pokemon with the most porn drawn of it~~
>doesn't know Gardevoir
Which is the stupidist thing that has every ahppend in the fucking pokemon anime lmao
don't worry Ash is gonna come up with some plan like HITTING HIS BIRD WITH LIGHTNING TO GET ELECTCITY ARMOR

they're literally the same thing as witches but born from negative emotions
```Because Madoka's wish only erased witches, grief was not removed from the new world as Madoka didn't change human nature. As a result, the wraiths are distortions of Madoka's cause and effect of her wish, and give magical girls other means of obtaining grief seeds to clean their soul gems and combat entropy.```

I was never part of kon watch so now idea
Mc is prime minister of Japan
Mudazumo is just absolutely absurd and it's great
Mudazumo is about world leaders settling problems with mahjong battles
Akagi about a hardcore gambler becoming a mahjong god.
Both great mahjong manga/anime
You should check them out
Np
oh that got an anime
i might in <#377148557796442134> after watching whatever this half movie is
about the plot
well i havne't said anything
oh tihs is club

well it's up on nyaa
45 minute movie
6 part huh...
http://gup.wikia.com/wiki/Girls_und_Panzer_das_Finale:_Part_1
blueray when
there's another one???? Shit i gotta watch
ago
im pretty sure the movie came out way longer than that
there might be a few more which is good cuz there haven't been many lately
doujin authors will just continue like normal
*go to comiket* "What's this series with the hot doujins?"
if anything it increases them
about doujins
they can't endorse it but they mostly don't care
probably
and it's waaaaaaaay too late at this point with the amount of doujin already exist
I don't know why they would bother but it's not gonna stop everyone
also source on this info please
doubt it even
that will `not` stop anyone lol
lol
???
panzer vor~
i dont think so
it's a proper name anyway so just saying Senshado is fine
I mean it's more I've translated things before and weird translations are jarring to me
if you just wanted me to tell you that you could have asked...i know japanese...
i mean it literally means the way of the tank yes
I don't really care....
sensha at least means tank
I mean it's not really like that at all...
it's less dumb than tankwondo
even Tankary is a fine translation. But Tankwondo sounds dumb...
renewel taekwondo is great
that sounds stupid as hell...
wtf is tankwondo...
I don't care for meme subs
what even is that
>not already having the movie saved
and no idea about the time
we haven't
panzer vor
damn right
good watch
Yukari is best
rip
was it always at 9am? I slept through it sorry
lol
just need to cut out the finger and put whatever
so i can't go get it
and i had the eps on a different HDD too
riparinno
can't wait to rewatch it when we get there
the movie was so good

Hanebedo
sorry I overlept. Was really tired last night
Well it's by the guy behind Lucifer and the biscuit hammer
I liked Kiri and Miku since G. Also isn't there a channel for this
yeah
the movie the only thing i dont really wanna miss
on ep 10
we canceled
girls und panzer
room is locked? ü§î
i know at least one major spoiler thats really stupid
Fate go has kinda become self aware on how stupid it is so it just goes all the way with the premises of some events
indeed
Finally
It's a proper anime this time though, not just ovas
babylon and camalot
Riyo anime when
all raw eps https://nyaa.si/view/306394
no one TL'd passed 28 https://nyaa.si/?f=0&c=0_0&q=Jewelpet+Sunshine

<@87512939107450880> nice
I've never even heard of those 3
you've already lost me
Gundam is way too fucking long for me to watch like 100 eps
I watched Thunderbolt and then the 3 movies
I really like Thunderbolt
I'm gonna be perfectly honest, I cannot stand the art style of the old old anime and I'm not gonna watch 97 episodes of it
+47
>50 episodes
oh well done that
if you like SoL and/or Namori
this volume is bonkers lol
<@87512939107450880> how far are you in Index

I made a monk the other day who has a horrifyingly high acrobatics and climb check
which led to his death by crit by a party member
I pulled a lich off a dragon the other day
which lets you make free intimadate checks whenever you power attack
i like corgern smash too
power attack is pretty staple if you're gonna be using huge weapons lol
that works too
fighter i assume
lol i did that once...
i have no idea how they even work in 5e actaully
i think anwyay
well guns were severely nerfed in 5e too...
naturally
gunslinger is there to do stupid damage
i sure hope so
lol
I also have a honey badger brawler and Ibex monk backup characters lol
I retired the gunslinger and am playing a grapple Slayer atm though
Gunslinger is fun, I have a shotgun user
oh shit pathfinder talk
and i have other casters already
i haven't used him yet
Sieg? Very mediocre
cardboard in love with Jeanne instead of Astolfo üöÆ
sieg is at least better than Siegfried
I was hoping the current event would have Saber Astolfo
I have Jack, I have okita, i have Illya and Abby. I need Tamamo
tamamo is last on my list of must have
and TAMAMO
I wish I had melt
request accepted
best
I whaled for Illya and Abigail...
must protecc illya
and Illya
I have Tomoe as well
indeed
mine https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/337805317276565525/440491622036406274/20180425_232320.JPG
apparenlty
if anyone on JP wants to add me ping me 077,191,088
Use her with Jack all the time

I have her
Wu is great
but yeah he's a guy
his gender is `secret`
give me a sec
I mean it's like two years before CCC would even come out on NA...
Astolfo is my best rider
obviously
it only took 2 years for Bryndhildr
Lancer Tama will eventually come back, but not any time soon
i just want Caster Tamamo...
i only have tamacat
i kinda want Achillies but not sure
even helps Seig get with Jeanne instead of having Sieg to himself <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
he's a badass and nicest guy
Astolfo is unironically the best character in Apocrypha
he's usable
his buff made him not as trash
have fun with lv100 10/10/10 +2000/2000 Jack
accepted request Sparkles
please release Saber Astolfo
at best
and he's still ok
He did
sadly
he's not good...
no
Astolfo is best boy
let me reload the game
best event was the Bunyan event
and events drop mats like candy
Fate GO is relatively easy once you have a good baseline of characters
whoever wants
add me 077,191,088
who here is actually on jp
deon is the same
which is hilarous
yeah astolfo also gets all positive effects from gender specific effects and no negative effects
but i dont use merlin cuz I use jack most of the time
well the plug suit is what you use for double merlin comps...
fran stuns herself all day
I don't really like plugsuit though
the 3 main ones are good
also he's not gonna get the lostbelt one for a long time
the dafault one is good in any situation
the default mystic code is one of the best ones
what
because the moon stole his sanity
and then she sees his dick
if sure hope so
anyway all of you go read that comic cuz it's the best
it's a "secret" but everyone knows he's a guy
in apocrypha
it litearlly is
and astolfo is a guy
also you should all ready this comic https://danbooru.donmai.us/pools/10385
Charlemagne is totally not Gudao in disgise
give us summer merlin as the fabled quick support
next summer please
I would roll so hard for swimsuit astolfo
you don't understand
i want to grail astolfo but im still hoping he gets an alternate class version of him that doesn't suck
too bad she has like no impact on the plot of Apocrypha
best girl
I have Jack so i never cared about low star assassins lol...
billy the kid is good too
low star assassins I guess Hassan of Serenity is ok
lol that video
other good low stars are Spartacus, Euryale, Leonatias, Cu Cullain, Lancer from EoR3,
for decent 3* or below
get Hans
lol what
her thong look so dumb
I want Jack to get a dress outfit <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
i can't spend them after enough
i have like 400 apples
i have illya so it's nbd
i want iri too but oh well
well jp has over a years worth of more content so yeah
what is Atlas dress
I don't use Buster characters that often besides illya nad Abigail
and semi off a single ten roll
i got okita off a ticket
i dont even want Semi
i got fucking Semiramis during Valtines
I've rolled every single Tamamo banner
I want Tamamo...
and if the node is just riders i use Jack/Shuten/Wu which just ends the lives of all riders lol
i use summer fran as backup saber
Summer Fran
i have a lot of servents too
my main party is Jack, Okita
I didn't get Anasasia sadly
im at the point in JP that i can roll for liteally wahtever i feel like cuz i already have everything covered
I would take Deon cuz i want him anyway
I had Sieg before i knew he was bad lol...
still
I want Deon
that Deon outfit is also really hot
the trifecta
Tamamo as art support, we good
when they actually have super hard challenge missions
was probably during Nerofest
I think there was a boss a while back who would hard target Merlins and other casters first lol
uh I dont remember, I think it's just a joke
yeah he's broken lol
nani
cuz farming them manually sucks
you get most of your mats from events actually
you can hope that events have the mats you need
getting mats is a pain for new players
it's in Epic or Remnent part 2
it's not
yeah....
supports here to help
use Archer Artoria on mordred
Yeah it's not like the Ibaraki raids
it was between penth and lancer medusa for me
i got Lancer Medusa
oh it was just every SR in the game that wasn't limited
wait you mean welfares?
it's not that big
SPATS <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
and she's cute af
she's so good with Jack and okita
love her
I have MHXA
I got Jack off the anniverary Gacha and Jack was like the onlyl reason i started playing this game. I probably would have quit if not for Jack
well that one is good
oh don't scare me <:GWnanamiCoconaSweat:402866237853401100>
this? http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Imaginary_Around
You got Imaginary Around?
wait Sakura CE??
it's so troll
lol
half of my 5*s are from silvers that sparked into gold
jesus
Moedred
wow
living dangerously
sparkle is gonna die from something terrible
wtf
Reached the Limit Level
i love this stupid message lol https://i.imgur.com/i5xLwDvh.png
indeed
i played NA just to roll tamamo and didn't get her
you're playing both? <:GWnanamiCoconaSweat:402866237853401100>
I was replying to a question furthuer up
I used to play League but it takes too much time
http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Frontier
her bond CE actually has depressing quote
lol
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
makes perfect sense
she's a Giant Loli
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/fategrandorder/images/2/20/PaulBunyan1.png/revision/latest?cb=20170802140354
cuz Bunyan is RiyoZerker
yea
and then Gudako comes to try and take her servent back and you fitght her off
and it's just Bunyan joining the Children Kingdom and messing around
on JP
my favorite event was the Paul Bunyan one that just came outta nowhere
lol
wasn't playing when it ran
I never played that event
I forgot hes even in the game lol
Bunyan
oh the children kingdom
whats that one
really strong for a 3*
yeah billy crits like mad
the only crit gen servent you ever need lol
Jack
geez
oh i have 5 2030s
I leveled him up for a jp event that required you to use a lot of different characters
billy is pretty good yeah
limit zero is arguabely the worst of the 3 so it's probably good i dont have it
I have 2 IAs, 3 Formalcrafts and zero limit zeros somehow
it would be pretty nuts on hiim too
best CE period on Jack, who is my main character
Imaginary Around is so good though
astolfo's np charge is 40%
if you use the mystic code that gives 20% charge you can do it. But you still need 2 other characters...
a lot of one turn stuff requires just having Kscopes <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
can't do it with 50% charge
oh right
he'll kill a wave easily
Spartacus
<:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
why sieg
wait Sieg?
no? But I probably have a better setup
üöÆ
I didn't even roll Tamamo
there are no waifus on that account
my NA account is abandoned
I ment JP
huh
I shift from having insane luck to absolute trash luck all the time
I had to quit NA fate go cuz it took too much time
i just do daily login in XDU lol...
lol rip
you keep rolling crazy shit lol
wanna friend me?
that's NA
who you got
üê≥
becuase that's not enough whatever iut is
who are you rolling
oh no
nvm
do you have better resoulution
Zero Escape series was so good
which i realized was asked 5 hour ago lol...
lol
shoulda paid attention
what
bond 3 is easy as hell...
Saberlot+Tamamo steamroll
Saberlot is so good on another note
Zerkerlot is gold though
lol
ü§∑
but you still need kscope
you only really need to level that up
yeah
it's his 2nd skill
like Spartacus
you want someone with that ideally
he has no self NP charge
I staight up have no idea what he does
oh alexander
who is aleX?
My farm team
oh right blackbeard
i dunno
support Drake or something
not really
nice
lol wtf
i dont have it on pc
I want it
wow
lol what
Otherwise the game is fine
I don't remember where, it was very noticeable when it happened though
Lags like mad at parts
Unfortunately
It has really bad performance issues
nice
so many buffs <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I play JP
lol that mimic
no one dumb enough to get banned from closed beta
give it time
lol
I wanna play that

lol
the wiki crashed so i can't look at any girls i want though
I can make space on this thing
any cute girls I should roll for
rip
wanna know if i can fit it on phone
how big is that game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JoFHGt01dCY&t=1570s
have you seen the Senior Hilter mod
that Hearts of Iron map lol
Camelot is fun lol
i just drilled it
not Eliz <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
come on Queen Eliz
4:10:00 build time
oh shit
in that game
I want Colt Revovler though
lol
Boats takes up less space on my phone
only SSR is the worst in the game <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
I need better ships
I dunno I'm trapped in mobage hell
I rolled San Diego <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
grailing Robin Hood <:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
that's not a cute gril
someone send help, I'm addicted to boat girls
god's work
or they're really dumb and already banned
there's a bunch of random people with delay, Eryule obv
oh
vamp?

Its a pain
You have to fight him like 4 more times
someone kill me
I ROLLED ANOTHER SAN DIEGO


that leak list is mostly wild guesses
or Lancer
Saber Astolfo please
I'm still hoping for an alternate class astolfo but since the Fate Apo evnet just finished it probably never happening
only SSR i have in Azur lane is Sandy <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
who
and grail Astolfo...
i need to skill up some servents...
This my list

I only have him NP1
except Angrya lol
you'll have every friend point servent NP5 before long
if you even need her
Eurayle isn't even hard to get
Jack, Support okita, Jalter can smash things
also Gil
you have Jack and Jalter
I dont see the problem
well you got moedred, Chiron and Achillies lol...
can't just cheese with support
well camelot is where you actually need a team
yeah gawain is a dick
http://fategrandorder.wikia.com/wiki/Bloodsucker
Tamamo has it too
I don't really keep up with any
like I'm really bad at rememebering VAs
ever
I don't keep up with VAs
wtf she voices diane in Sins lol
but even so
oh right

Stheno <:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
the worst SSR in the game
2 of me 3 SSRs are fucking San Diego
I have trash
and if it's inspired by pokemon go, im not interested anyway
sounds super fake lol
Foreigners lol
I just realized how good Abigail is for the ibaraki event lol...
who the fuck is the culprit to this event lol...
I'm making Saint Louis right now
Saint Louis and Neptune are cute though https://worldofwarships.asia/dcont/fb/image/16dbe972-4221-11e8-88fe-38eaa7374f3c.png
i dunno what wows is gonna get from Azurlane though
rip
too bad i don't play it
WoWs had a Haifuri collab?
oh
in Azur lane
like the HMS Neptune and Saint Louis
WoW collab is why the Prototype ships exist
liteally
it was World of Warships
recently
they already did
do guns drop in Girls frontline
https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/2/2a/Laffey.png
she's cute
I have Laffey
Laffey and Ayanami are the best gunboat and torpedo destroyers in the game
time to bully Ibaraki
whew
wait how much did you use for her
well i guess NA doesn't have wu
Jack/Shuten/Wu just walks over Rider only nodes
Shuten üëå
nice
what
except Laffey
all my boat waifus are bad <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
lol
what is your profile pic
and NA doesn't have Foreigners yet lol
with a billion hp
bullyling Ibaraki is annoying cuz she's a zerker
because Apo raids were piss easy
I've never had problems with ps3 controls
lol
my room sucks

like the Vampire guy who sucks his immortal wife dry every match
and all the side characters taht have like nothing to do with the main story
the Jellyfish Pirates are great though
he's old as hell
becasue only japanese people can use special kind of magic
I still like the part where the villain in GG just MURDERS ALL OF JAPAN cuz they're dangerous
kinda
at least before Central fiction it made sense
I'd argue blazblue actually makes more sense
it's completely written from "how can i make this make sense" backward
XD
you'll just confuse yourself
please don't try to look it up
the guilty gear lore makes no fucking sense lol
but I watched a 3 hour summery of the lore of the series for some reason
I never played any Guilty Gear games
I played Skullgirls for the story but im really bad at it
also played Makoto in SF4 or whatever number it was
I'm REALLY bad at melty blood though
I play Satsuki in Melty Blood and Linne and Orie in Uniel
but no one plays Melty Blood anymore
and Melty blood lol
I play Uniel
There is no cure for my problem
I have a crippling addiction to Gacha games
<:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
Yes
also looks cool as fuck
the best aircraft carrier in the game
the Enterprise
Fuuuuck yes
huh?
That bitch spider
Only BB boss I found a pain was fucking Rom
only salvageable parts were the ram and drives
not like it matters
the thing is dead anyway
zzzzzz
two of the screws on the back panel broke when i was taking them off and i had to rip off the fucking panel
all the screws are really small and cheap as fuck
or something
I need a #00
<:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
im replacing the disk drive in this laptop with a ssd from an old laptop but i dont have the right screwdriver to get the stupid ssd out...
but im broke
I need a new compter
fucking trash
meanwhile I was replacing ram from an old pc into my current one only to find out its not compatible
droid maxx
and my 5 years old apparenlty i mean 2 years old
i have a droid
lol
so is mine
oh
what is the latest nexus called
yeah
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
they just tag it
people don't know what those really mean anymore
appareanlty it's really good
has anyone played Wizard of legend yet
speaking of games
i dunno what that is
all of the skins in Fate go are F2P at least
different business model i suppose
which is weird....
whaling the gacha is extremely cost inefficent
lol
except if you wanna buy skins
actually you can't even really whale in boat girls
so is boat girls
ok it is gambling
it's like gambling but
in gacha hell
join us
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
so is yuri, but it's delicious
well that's to be expected
bloodborne
It's really good imo but the community is full of weirdos...
Lol
Hours late on replying to convo
Dangan Ronpa is a Murder mystery game
at some point near the end of Monster Girl Quest I was just skipping the sex scenes cuz i wanted to get back to the plot lol
are best
fluffy tails
indeed
yes it's monster girl quest
the plot is so good though
so good
Monmusu Quest has plenty of Lamia though
sad
no lamia it seems
pirate themed
it's a monster girl hentai VN
they lowered the price of the game in protest of valve
oh it is
is it on their website?
where did you get the adult patch for mutiny <@!127644949884698624>
that would make sense
that's not even the gacha though
I've been trying to get a drop  for a week and I've gotten litearlly every possilbe drop except the girl i want
oh nice
is she limited
games take way to long to finish in league
kk
is combat is a little sluggish at times but plot is fantastic
it's good
whew im 100% not a fan of this art
but it's Behemoth
bahemoth was good with pit people
oh they from a different game
that one is good too
I want this one
who this be
also we might want to bring this to NSFW
either way he gets raped by moth girl
is it? Thought the guy was an adult
i now what series you're talking about
and Bree
Foo is cute
the plot of Monster girl quest so unexpectedly good
I was refering to Monster girl quest cuz it has lamia in it that Saki asked about
yes.
lol
Fatal Frame?
Steam like "oh shit people actually buy this shit??" And are backpedaling hard
indeed
than again Azur lane is basically S rank or you die lol
same drop rate reguardless of rank
doesn't work like that in Azur lane
hmm
I almost got disintergrated by that golum that can CAST SPELLS for some reason
the what
you only need a like 200k gold worth weapon to fight it
IKR
vorpal fucking weapon
as in you need vorpal to get passed damage resist
good thing we didn't run into one (yet)
and their speech makes you go insane
because of course they do
they have DR/vorpal
Jabberwocks are fucked up
and then we had to fight 13 child sized wraiths and a golum guarding a phylatery
incidnetaly in my D&D campagin on friday, we bodied a bunch of Buletts while avoding jabberwocks and badgersnatches
what about it
Nice
I'm just saying
yes yes
and made the fight rather trivial
so we litearlly sundered the wall of the house to let sunlight in
like the wraiths we fought had light powerlessness
challenge rating in general is misleading cuz your players can find unexpected ways to overcome encounters(which isn't necessarly a bad thing)
yeah I don't know anything about 5e so I can't help on that part
useful link
dimentionally bind
(unless you bind them and then kill them)
like demons wouldn't care cuz they just go back to their plane when they die
most enemies don't fight to the death unless they have a reason to
obviously you're just gonna kill them
like if it's a group of goblins or something
not all fights have to be hit it until it dies but it depends on the enemies
PCs and enemies fight it out until either all of one side are dead or incapcitated. Alternative you could have monsters run away. Or PCs might be able to talk down enemies when only a few are left or anything that makes sense.
as in what should your monsters or whatever you're using do?
players should blow about 25%-50% of their resources during a fight(at leasti n pathfinder)
challenge rating
a good measure of a proper fight is based on CR and how many resources the players have to blow on a figtht
oh
what even is phb
also I dont know shit about 5e
what you having problems with
as far as DM'ing, I'm not very good at it myself so I'm not sure
1 month later the city gets attacked by flying star people
oh we accidentally left a portal to some random plane on when we escaped a dungeon
(at least we 95% sure it was before stabbing it)
also I stabbed a corgi in the face cuz it was a dragon in disguise
leveled completely
well there was a time that the king blew up leveled an entire city cuz he went crazy
hmmm
uhhh
want to know anything more about my DND game?
tfw this isn't even the most fucked up thing that's happened
who, incidnetally, were the child sized wraiths that we fought
we sent that lich's plyactery or however you spell it to a church to get destroyed while we deal with the corpses of the elven children we found
other than on fridays which is my normal game
I mean i dont have time to do another game
but I don't have the time for another game and i need help for it
I want to DM a Made in Abyss inspired dungeon crawl
oh rather, I wanted to get into it and he helped
yeah he got me into it
lol
I'm playing with a guy whos been playing tabletop games for like 20 years
<:GWnanamiCoconaSweat:402866237853401100>
>thinking they're hot shit
>playing 5e
>new players
oh dear
do they know how to rpg
lol
I have to sleep so we can talk more later
guess he got pulled away
if players are starting the combat with like an ambush, generally they can all get an action out before inititive offically begins. (The surprise round)
anyway do you need help on things besides just combat while we're here?
also I don't think new players would think of something silly like taht
I dont think you can spend that many easily
lol
do you have things to skip wait time in that?
the good time for azur land is 420
that sounds good

lol
wrong chat
I think I can fully kai Portland i just need level 90
for skyrim
he ascended beyond Todd
god activity is not recognized
lmao
fucking jesus
Irresponsible admirals
Who is letting these children fight in war
Sure can
But why can't I just summon Danny devito
Shadowrun tabletop RPG
only character I'm actually decent with is Linne in Uniel lol
I'm still bad
I mean I played them in highschool
Lol
I'm bad at fighting games but I love them
Oh NVM misread
Now allowed?
How many Blazblue Charas are actually in it anyway
Why even
Lol
Blazblue has the highest brand recognition of any of the characters in the game
Not even real mahjong
Wtf is that lol
Cool
Because they're part of Nintendo
But they won't go out of business like 4kids
They're such a disgrace
Treehouse are the 4kids if game translation
They also removed the bad end from the original game for literally no reason
Of course Bravely Second is censored. It's translated by fucking treehouse.
naturally
I just got a maid https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/413900206904573952/448927127035707402/Screenshot_2018-05-23-12-15-34.png
i think you can get every character's ending in the same playtrhough if you're don't fuck it up
well it's not really a route
did her route first
best character
my favorite is either Dorthey or Sei
oh you're that early
who is your favorite chara
you can though
anyway it's so good
I think so?
even the corperate guy who always orders a big beer turns out to be pretty cool dude
I like all the characters too
the way the story is told is so nice
Boss is such a troll in VA11 HALL-A
oh
a what
all the characters so good
naw was something else
but whatever they used
actually it wasn't kickstarter
i supported the kickstater for them
100% recommend
Vall HALL-A is GREAT
I was talking about Shadowrun
but that's not something you can just sit down and play
Lol
:salt:
lol
I like how you can pop a revive item before you die if you're hp has ticked down to 0 yet too
and it kills itself
just walk over the enemy
lol I like that thing in Earthbound too
I hate random encounters cuz they don't show up when im actually trying to farm shit lol
this bot totally won't be abused
lol that edit
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
yeah
yup
same...
I didn't realize how far along the cancer was
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
oh
occasionally
I didn't pay attention after the last two weren't as good...
I didn't know there was a 4
the 1st one was one of the best games ever made
good
hopefully it's not like the vita game...
lol waht
last 3 rolls I made were 4* 5* 4*
I haven't been really paying attention to it beyond the mutiny thing
this is probably all gonna blow over or steam is just shooting themsleves in the foot
Neptunia is such a huge franchise
are you insane
I'm pretty sure they're not gonna remove the neptunia games lmao
why would they remove the Nep games?
incidentally, none of the characters I care about are Blazblue lol...
but most of the charas i wanna play are DLC <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I havne't played the demo yet
he has the demo
my friend says the game plays well at least
I want Aegis <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
without the DLC
it's not like the roaster is even that big
???
game by the creator of Castlevania
I thought it was the 2d prequal thing that was coming out
Nowi is best
Got nowi and Tiki and stopped playing lol
Same
I think so
You can't just condense 2 years worth of events
Well yeah
Have fun with Go West, that event sucks ass lol
And they know they can get away with it
Beyond the dlc nonsense, the game looks pretty damn good
Cuz the game is good
Blazblue extend
Yeah they do ...
For all of it?
How much is the dlc anyway
And the dlc stuff is kinda shitty but I know that they HAVE to get the game out before Evo for it to have any relevance in the community
I mean... If you mean the rereleases of games like sf ultea then yeah but between actual numbered iterations of the game it is a completely different game
I dont really think it looks that bad
lol
charas i care about are Linne, Orie, Ruby, Aigis, Naoto
that might be an issue with chinese font tbh
Blazblue story is fucking hilarious though
Bandai Namco actually works on dlc characters that come out months after the game is released. At least with 7. I have no idea about any Tekken before 7.
I love it
Dude Competitive Cathrine is fucking sick
Ikr
It's so bad that it didn't get into Evo lmao
Not that
OH NO
The reason no one wanted to play brawl competitively was the mechanics not the business model
And none of these ones are "bad games" mechanically
That's cuz brawl was a bad game
Companies put up the prize pools
At least the big ones
The companies mostly sponxer the tournaments themselves
???
At tournament
Except they won't cuz if you're competitive you need to be playing the newest version
I still wanna do a Made in Abyss inspired game
I'm interested but dunno about time
Dnd night
Well I gtg anyway
I can play Satsuki, poorly
I'm not either
Lol
I can play Uniel and Melty Blood
We should play some fight games sometime (if anyone is on the same fucking contiant here lmao)
It's called uniel, don't ask me why
<:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
Uniel is the only fighting game I'm half decent at
Yeah I could never actually play Skullgirls I was so bad at it but the astetic is so good
That tweet won't load for me I'm on mobile atm
Skullgirls is great
I can't exactly say they don't care about the community though. And a lot of the dlcs are actually good.
Getting into a paradox game after it's been out for a while is so rediculous
They really should... But the way it is right now, people just bite the bullet
Lol that kappa ryu
MvC infinite looks so bad it's sad...
Rights to x men characters are so Convoluted
yeah but you don't actaully get to hear 42 dice hit the table
nothing like rolling 15d6 at once
sad
can't roll real dice online though
nine sided die <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
anyway we can probably use roll20 if we're gonna do a game, it seems like the easiest thing to use
yeah....that's not something you do unless you know every player extremely well....
it started off with some refugees from the underdark iirc and we expanded it until it got a little outta hand
We built a city in one of our campaigns
of course there's also nothing wrong with just murder hobo'ing around if thats what you want to do imo
and really you can do a lot of stuff before stats ever come into question. It really depending on the experience of the players and the DM.
and im not a fan of 5e personally
well i know pathfinder
Sigh
I'm now mad cuz I had to come a the way to the dms place for no reason...
And dnd got cancelled
It could work
i can be arond
frontline fighter in any case
Ibex is a monk, Honey badger is a Brawler if we're doing pathfinder. If another system ill adapt them accordingly
so how many people do we have total interested right now
Ibex was soemthing i made like 2 weeks ago for fun lol...
i have lore for my honey badger guy. HAven't worked on Ibex yet
that's fine
i try not to play characters that are directly charactesr from other series. Even if they're very heavily inspired by specific characters. (like my Ibex and honey badger lol...)
maybe?
ü§∑
as a catch all term
I use D&D to refer to tabletop RPGs in general
i kinda wanna play my Ibex girl or honey badger character
I've never done online D&D so dunno
you can do combat without a grid but depends on the fight (and it's probably a lot harder to visualize online than when talking to people IRL)
we'll see
on it
and we can also see the other players
yeah but spamming the channel would be less than ideal
I mean roll20 is very useful
it's so fun
text based is fine if eveyrone knows how to play
voice chat is fine
why doesn't yours
dragon uprising
are you asking yourself if you're still here
apparently
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
oh i muted that channel lool
yet
ban mods for shitposting in the gaming chan <:Ver:336656981144109066>
*rimshot*
we need to MUTINY
no thats what they want you to do
bullying lolis <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
nuuuuuuuu
I want off the boat
what is happening
Alice is gonna be something with Chrisma is the gods probably
captain gonna make us hit the lighthouse
Danger 5 it up
is therea TLDR of this thing lol
sweet jesus the Maid rulebook is huge
i never actually played 4e though
i dunno about that...
yeah with simplicity comes restriction
as much as i like pathfinder, it is very confusing at first
I mean there definitely are some that are easier to get into
zzz
pdf taking the next year to download
let me look at what maid is first
downloading the pdf
sounds good
I've never even heard of that one
what is ova
I can do anime bullshit if people want but im not familar with it
I dunno about a symphogear world but I'm ok if everyone else wants to
whew this pdf is colorful
how does OVA work
I'm getting a few chara ideas now..
I was actually gonna revote combat but i got outvoted anyway
justify huh
can i be a psychopathic loli in meidos
ova pdf still downloading
i dunno how i feel about maid <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
need more suffering
I immidatley thought it was moth cuz of what you said earlier
oh
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
are you weak to bugspray
besides Dainslieve lol
whats an famous evil weapon
I dunno
or it could have nothing to do with the relic
possiblity
ü§î
I guess that can probably be something from her relic that infected her
well right now I'm leaning on a girl who is possessed by some kind of violent entity
also if we're actually doing something that's based on symphogear, that might throw most of my plans out the window
break the computer
lol
>having a love interest is a weakness
most of my ideas are just blantantly ripping off concepts from different manga that i like kek
I have a number of character ideas taht would probably work better in OVA
batman it up
lol being rich is a power in OVA
OVA looks interesting
swtfi s that name
oh dear
hmm
if we aren't limited to real world weapons I can pull a weapon from Granblue lol...
perhaps
Parashu, Tyrfing or something seems feesible
i need a weapon that makes sense to make my character crazy
no evil
<:GWnanamiHanekaWhat:399930848914440192>
lol tv tropes has a list of evil weapons
so can we use Zesshou lol
the concept is consolidated from inspiration from like 6 different characters
im not really sure yet
or me
for yourself?
like claws or an axe or something
her fighting style is probably gonna be something wild and savage
shiva's axe
or Parashu
why are all the evil swords norse lol
or Tyrfing
Skofnung maybe <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
Noise?
what are we even fighting?
or fire
may or may not have ice themed attacks
tfw deciding weaknesses before abiliies
I dunno what im even taking besides Room For Two lol
ranged option is lashing with chains or something
Harderest punch
I'm not very creative with attacks <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
well i can't get the page to load so i can press save
can someone upload a direct download of the OVA pdf, the page won't load on my comp
i think i have the idea down. Gleipnir manifesting as an axe. Possessed by the resentment of Fenrir or something
I suppose that works
cuz I've already figured out kinda how to do this with ova's system
so are we doing OVA or what
too many weapons
<:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
oh wait dark souls weapons
https://gbf.wiki/images/1/10/Nibelung_Horn.png
we moved to <#449826367903629313>
im thinking or reflavoing demensional pocket into making something out of ice
lol
SONG needs better security
not even intentional lol...
so my character gonna be mentally unstable and generally afraid of her powers while being tormented by the soul of fenrir. Something along those lines
i imagine my character would be singing metal or something lol
oh im dumb i should do that
https://rpg.rem.uz/_Collections/Cartoon%20Games/OVA%20System/OVA%20-%20Anime%20Role-Playing%20Game%20Core.pdf
so those negatives lol
well I'm already bumping Room For Two to rank 3
and i still can't get this thing to load
lmao
low as fuck
Skyrim needs to stop
i just watch Lobos Jr
I need to play the DLC for Dark Souls 3 still...
go play Bioshock 1 <:ShirabeStare:336659688236122113>
NANI
>never played bioshock
aren't you playing D&D lol
who cares about the tier list anyway. Friend went out of his way to win games with low tier characters just to fuck with people
isn't Ike really good in 4??
ventual?
my problem is i want a lot of the games on it
nothing can run crysis
I actually thought there already was one...
god help you
you're looking at forums
oh that's your mistake
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
well none of the people i play with do
like this is the first time anyone has ever mentioned it to me
I've never herad anyone complain about too many FE characters
why would that annoy them?
then maybe i'd actually play a FE chara
Give me Nowi or something
Nintendo buys satelite lol
4 players just ends up with 2 people 1v1'ing most of the time. 8 player is fuck you good luck
8 players is a clusterfuck
I also have smash 4
lol i dont even have a switch
like absurdly strong
I fucking love Ness's back throw though, it's so strong
well Ganon and ike can launch on pretty low %
I'm terrible with anything that's heavier than ness lol...
lol
including wii fit trainer
my friend who plays fighting games competitively plays like all the female characters
I play Ness in smash
beyonetta is fun
i hate that Greninja got in the over another pokemon
which is probbaly why they were never in smash
Digimon had a lot of its own fighting games back in teh day though
lol Agumon
well i assume Squid boy/girl are getting added with the way they annouced it
BC 1000
the next lostbelt is uhhh
we'll see
oh boy
maybe, both of them won't be coming out for a WHILE
doubtful
it is 100% scath
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UXs13te7ZOc
also Caster Scathach
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T3liVMkfA9A
Lostbelt Tama
need to find the video
actually there is a new Tama coming out...
I need fluffy tails
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I NEED HER
GIMMIE THAT
There's an event in a few days I'm gonna roll everything for in azur lane
his pocket is the most hilarious thing in the game
one of the only charas I'm not garbage with...
I love villager
https://www.reddit.com/r/smashbros/comments/1zejdr/ganondorf_vs_captain_falcon/?st=jhpztv7d&sh=7590ff0c
man I would be really tempted by the Okita banner going on if i didn't have her
I don't
Sanzou is really good if you wanna roll her
uhhh, all them look meh
uh i have no idea, I skipped the event lol...
Illya actually has higher max damage but sanzou can spam more
not that I give a fuck, I use Illya
Sanzo is the best Single Target caster in the game
super grindy and there's not even a welfare
lol have fun
I still need banana loli
you have to whale pretty hard to actually get enough black graphs
I'm running out of people i care to EXP
Saber?
which Alter
I think NEET
actually that's not right it was rolling for someone else
I got Waver while rolling for Tamamo
Did you roll more 5* while I wasn't looking
Where are you on jp
For blue
Lv100 Jack bulldozes the highest level event quest
Since she was stuck at np3 for a long time
I got my chacha to np5 and didn't really bother with rest of event
Rerun
There's going to be 5 hours of "totally not something important" maintenance after this current event ends
also yes we need Miyu servent <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
he's so much stronger
Miyuverse shirou would kill FSN shriou
literally using the power of himself from an alternate universe
best brother
Miyuverse shirou sacrificed everything for his little sister
he's op as fuck
just give us Prillya Shirou
he 100% would
I still want Kotomine Rasputin servent
fucking Kotomine
he didn't see that one coming
except for when da vinci got hand knifed
Holmes always thinks ahead
they brought the case taht contains the origin data for all the summoned servents with them on the car
that's kinda frozen over
but
all everyone used to hang out in Chaledea
for story purposes
thakn god Anastesia isn't limited
He's limited so not happening
looks so rediculous
Ivan's design is maximum troll btw
that's not the same David is it?
lol probably
who are you running
she, Waver and Merlin are all so good.
she's ment to be one of the most broken supports in the game
Tamamo isn't ment to do damage
and just spammed jack NP
went i was bullying Ibaraki i brought Jack/okita/shuten lol
well the damage CEs are great
<:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
bring Jack and have fun
oh that thing
who and what
there's those lunatics who make stall teams go for 3000 turns becasue they can
can achieve the same thing with any stall team and not using like 10 grails lol

Asterios is meme
Bunyan's buffs are absurd
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

grailed attack is less than 9000 lol
isn't he bad
what does gillies saber even do
all those dank memers with lv100 Angrya
pretty sure every servent in the game has been 100 by someone
going to 90 isn't that bad
only 100 I have is Jack
Kiyo kinda sucks, I'd rather just get Lancer Kiyo
I already put bunyan to lv80
fuck no lmao
I need to figure out what to do with 13 grails
indeed

wall of text <:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
I never even played pokemon go...
Lmao
What's wrong with his face
P5 and Nier Automata were the best things
To me
That's not soon
Not that soon
Anyone play Wizard of Legend?
Last Battlefield I played was Hardline and I stopped playing a week after getting the .300 knockout
I don't even know what they're on now lol
Actually Advanced warfare was kinda fun
Gross
Like what
Overwatch doesn't have anything I want.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
The Gacha gives me strength
Is Thompson any good
Azir lane is getting submarines apparently
<:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
Event where I get to roll for despair is tomorrow
no
I'm going to sleep
ÂÆà‰∫∫
Anyway that would become Mamori I guess
Fuck I can't spell
Since tsubasa talks with old Japanese phrases
It might be more aracic than Mamoru
I'm also stupid so there's that
Literally never heard of that other one lol
ÂÆà„Çã
This is the word I normally see for protect
At least not the word I know
Though it's not the normal kanji you used for like protect
The reading does indeed say that
What is it supposed to say
Uhhh
Incidently I also use the same name for everything that was my RuneScape character..
If I was creative with names I wouldn't be going by this
No one ever takes my shitty name in games lol
Ys is good
I even stopped playing Gacha games for them <:Ver:336656981144109066>
and susequently nerfed into the floor
i.e. the most broken card for 3 months

<:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
anyone play Shadowverse?
like in Shadowverse...
not if there's a reward involved
that doesn't work for me...
that's what Ross's from Accused Farms is very against. Games dying because of server shutdowns and stuff
yeah that's pretty shitty
PvP tends to make me tilt off the face of the earth though
well i dont play many of the AAA releases anymore
I prefer PvE games. Not very interested in PvP unless it's 1v1
EA is a piece of shit
your mistake is EA
I mean there's plenty of successful non multipler games
tfw I've never bought a battle royale game
Majima is best
nani??
what
Majima everywhere is the best thing about Kiwami
what the fucfk is that lol
whats difference between Lancers and grenadier
oh
that gravestone taunting me
well...except Isara <:GWnanamiKonataCry:405043507544457226>
dunno if im ever gonna use that cuz I didn't let ANYONE die in 1 lol
someone actaully having fun
wasn't there a medic dog in 1
what even is the plot of this one
lmao
but my continuity
q_q
oh my god they named their child Isara, I forgot about that
but Isara is dead <:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>

wtf
lol

Isara???
I would if i heard it but i never remember names
the corssover is actually good though
Never played mvc
Oh
what do you mean current Wolverine
huh
ok I've heard Steve Blum
dont know anyone by name anyway
nope
I don't know ANY english anime VAs
yeah i've never heard of that person lol
I don't think any of them can top 1's story
and story
as long as the voices are as good as 1
I don't have a switch so who knows
indeed
after 2 and 3 people don't trust it anymore
yes but not everyone knows that
I hate most of the song remixes in the dancing games...
well people don't trust the Valkyria Chronicles name anymore...
I know
but it's not a main line game in any way
I disagree
<:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
I want it
is it JP only
I want her
<@!102691114762371072> who is this https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/443835249038852097/451611526244335617/Screenshot_20180530-215312.png

pretty sure you can get a pink one
I have the persona 3ds
lol
and definitely the best plane game
still one of the best games I've ever played
yeah it's quite old...
would absolutely recommend it if you can somehow play it
the plot of it is shockingly good and reminded me of Valkyria Chronicals a bit.
<@188714906143424513>
have you ever palyed Ace Combat 6
that one abilty that lets you dodge fire is so op
mostly moving through dangerous spots against overwatch fire
I totally didn't save scum during dangerous parts to make sure no one ever died
any tactic is valid in war
are there valkries in the game?
are they Valkries?
I absolutely won't remember this by the time the game comes out
lol
when si the game even out
I loved fielding the two snipers that buff each other in 1 lol
I assume characters still have unique traits and stuff
why though
it's more artilary than grenade lol
She's a Battleship???

I sure hope he did
lol
oh boy
do you want to meme
I don't even play hearthstone lol
don't listen to me
hadronox
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

symantics
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

nani
Is that from the new Gorillaz song
Anagrammed?
first game
I never actually played the original

I half expected Majima to pop out of aclaw machine in that game
what if you're a claw machine master IRL
I don't know you
oh

proof of prizes
<:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>

Oh I guess this should go in tabletops
Accidentally
And we actually collaspsed the house and lit it on fire before leaving
Someone turned them in wraiths and stuffed the bodies in boxes
They were already dead
Tfw transporting 12 elf corpses through a forest takes 2 hours

Girls und panzer?
Kingdom hearts pretty much makes sense, there's just a lot if nonsense that happens that you have to know about lol
But it's so Convoluted that it's hilarious
<:Ver:336656981144109066>

<@!102691114762371072> this is one of the weapons that's actually good to get dupes
I don't need THREEE Bahamuts
ARE YPOU FUCKING SERIOUS

the only dupes that are useful are VERY specific weapons THAT IM TRYING TO GET
I'd rather have any new character than a fucking gold moon
unless you're a whale
they're VERY bad
no
trash fish, duplicate character and Vane
oh i pulled THREE SSRs. THEYRE JUST NOT WHAT I WANT
it didn't work
<:GWnanamiChiakiYeah:402195682108243968>
everything i roll is trash <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
ITS A FISHER MAN
If it's another fish I'm gonna throw it in a blender
I WONDER WHAT IT IS
OH ANOTHER SSR

this motherfucker was waiting on a SINGLE red dragon
and went from 1st to last from a ron <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
fuck i furiten'd myself
btw this is the best song to play after calling riichi
first place went on a 4 win streak and nearly bankrupt the other two
<@188714906143424513> what is that
Hanafuda?
Wish I could play Mahjong with ppl I know..
won a game <:GWnanamiChiakiYeah:402195682108243968>
Yoku's Island
I might check it out once i finish whatever im playing right now
<@99695384296701952>
is that game good
but i looked up a plot summery anyway cuz i have a problem
the mobile game is the only one i haven't actually played
it will never end
and then Kingdom Hearts 4 is gonna be annouced
probably
don't worry 3 is ACUTALLY coming out
i still like how he asked people to email him Nier lewds
3 is fine if not for the LAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAG
oh the gameplay
what??
mostly
Yoko Taro has the right ideas
oh god no
yeah I've seen them it's great
nice guy Yakuza
all the Hostess plotlines are great
yes
no I'm bad
me?
of course she does
what else would she sing
Oh that, no why would I lol
it's not really that necessary unless you're on ng+
yeah
the random dungeon
go to the uhh..whats it called
I never bothered
and late game you have mountains of money so it's not like it costs anything to call her litrally every day lol
Kawakami is one of the most op confidants lol
without using time
since you can pay her to make coffee
also hilariously op
Kawakami is great
it effects what happens on valatines day and that's about it
I went out with the doctor
cuz she's hot
going out with them doesn't change that
you do
<@!102691114762371072> aren't you in the moutainains??
you can just not go out with them and still max their confidant
oh you're playing p5
whats this about Hawaii
Makoto's awakening was so good
toss up between Doctor, Kawakami, Makoto and Haru for me
Makoto is other best girl though
Alice and Sandlephone were my primary for the final boss
Morgana's outfits are pretty troll though
ehh, all the costumes in the base game are sick as hell though
lol
are they even good
dlc <:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
the Velvet Room attendents are optional bosses in every game
I used morgana as out of combat heal bot
my end game party was actually using every character except Morgana lol
her strength is through the fucking roof
lol she's so good
speaking of Morgana, I never actually used him in a fight
I love her
oh
what cute girl <:GWnanamiHanekaWhat:399930848914440192>
oh
I dont remember when hawaii happens lol
what dungeon are you on
since high level personas cost ass loads
i ment for summoning from the book
it's only necessary when you're making end game personas cuz they costs a shit ton of money to fuse
well i think i figured out how lobbies work?
I'm trying to a find a meme about taht but i can't find it now..
that's what the doujins are for
it's good
ok I'm gonna go ask mahjong reddit how to do this lol...
it would be easier to help in voice
I mean it's basically poker with a lot more hands
still trying to figure out how to make a lobby...
this isn't Mudazumo
and that sounds like an accurate price
i think they forgot k
it's RNG either way
well it's hard to do that when not IRL
it looks cool though lol
i have no fucking clue
this is riichi mahjong
probably chinese
which is silly
I don't know that you can make a private lobby in the browser client...
sensible place to have it
of course
need to figure out how to set private lobby...
http://saki.wikia.com/wiki/Tenhou_game_instructions

the token guy who has aboout 0.01% screentime
everyone in Saki is super gay
i dont have Nodoka's giant tits though
fat penguin
I have this
whenever you're free
being in voice to explain things would be prefered
so we'd have 4
I might be able to get a friend in I know who plays
I wish
I've chombo'd IRL before lol
so
chombo is impossible in online
also if you choose to pass a winning tile to be cheeky or something the same thing applies

nani
whaling gacha is relatively pointless, they make money off skins mainly probably
both are very f2p friendly
well Kancolle is garbage, Azur lane is more like GFL
so you have Kaga, Akagi, Nagato backline and melt `everything` <:Ver:336656981144109066>
they're even better cuz the new event girl buffs IJN ships
foxfire
i like the planes literally made of fire
and super broken
yeah
https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/0/06/Akagi.png
Fox girls though https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/9/9a/Kaga.png

my favorite not vocal song in the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FqoqxD-DHA
Rewrite has such good songs
speaking of VN songs https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vvTiq7XamoU
there are some good eroge VNs though I liked...
sadly
it was during the age where it had to be eroge to sell
yup...
yeah
one of the best title screen themes
oh no
as for favorite VN, I've played too many to really have a favorite
will someday
Ever17 was good. I didn't get around to playing the other two...
but I still liked it
yeah...
but i think I memorized the answers to every puzzle
i wanna go replay 999

I think i broke the calculator
Kingdom Hearts has never disappointed me, it just takes `forever` to come out

it's han-gyaku anyway
different kanji
i dont think so
yes
i guess hangyaku is weird
hm
should be shirabe no Hangyaku
she's here to take your power Saki
and all the main characters are based on game consoles
lol
the plot of the first game is literally fighting Piracy and the villain is R4
Neptunia's entire plot is about breaking the 4th wall and meta commentarty
and a musou one that also sucks
there's also a rythem game one that sucks
mostly
JRPG
most of them Limited editions
he has every neptunia game
or whatever
rebirth
i see
and you don't play neptunia for the gameplay
i dunno what the 5th is
he has the first one on ps3 in Japaense, NA and PAL and on steam lmao
no i mean he bought the same ones 5 times
my friend has bought multiple Neptunia games 5 times
I assume someone translates I guess
Since it's in jp
I mean you're not gonna be reading it anyway
Yeah...
Not even sprites
Combat is roll dice at each other with portraits
I looked at the lack of gameplay in kancolle and got bored fast
I mean they play Fate go and gbf now
And I've heard horror stories from 2 people who used to main Kancolle
I cba too
I appreciate the fantastic doujins though
KC gameplay is RNG simulator
About the authenticity thing
And I guess about the ship design thing but I kinda just... Don't really care tbh
Kc is never gonna get localized
At this point
It's hardly even a ripoff. The gameplay is far different
Exactly...
Honestly I hate KC gameplay
Jokers ougi looks cool as fuck https://twitter.com/granbluefantasy/status/1007498849303162881

Lol what is that clickbait title
I know I'm joking
But
Well I could
I'm on phone so I can't
This convo getting nsfw fast kek
Shimakaze gets around

Actual
Do you have links
Not a fan
And Shimakaze but doujins are enough for me for those Chara
Yes
Also Ro
Whatever her name is
Russian one
Hibiki*
Yes them. Hikari and all that
The only designs I really like from Kancolle are the loli destroyer squad
Also I like the design better personally, even if they're not authentic I guess...
I thought AL was just a ripoff too before actually playing it and I definitely prefer it...

Washizu mahjong is intense
<@!102691114762371072> did you watch any more of PJ's speedruns?
oh right that
it's gao
Latooni is secretly a monster
<:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
wtf
I've played Automata but don't remember that
my SV stats are so screwed lol
<:KanadeRooster:336659950258356227>
actually the magus has levels of something else i forgot
slayer shadowdancer, bard, scout rogue, wizard and magus respectively
also my current party has no cooridnation on races either. We have a tsukumogami, catfolk, kitsune, human and living gem thing...
my honey badger brawler i had no idea what feats to take cuz martial flexibility already covered so much
from the srd
offically
I use anything that exists
so I barely need the bonus for the way i play
I've actaully run into the problem of having no idea what feats to take mid/late levels in pathfinder lol...
hardly
yes
playing for lives
lethal ippan hanchan
what do you mean you haven't been to blighttown lol
can't üöì for facts
<@200030864497704960> very good VN
instead

finished

https://theyetee.com/collections/sgdq/products/first-flame bought
cute
lol
contraery to popluar belief i actually play the gacha games i do cuz i find them fun and GFL just isn't one of the ones that clicked to me
*shrug*
I actually don't really like it that much tbh
I haven't really been playing GFL
literally more than you could possiblely use
I have like 300 of those in AL
<@347524010868867073>
what you want to know
yes
Fuck yeah first roll lmao
is so good
the TAS of it is fucking wild lol
yup
but i haven't played it yet and don't have a switch
i looks fucking amazing
have fun
having gacha for skins is just silly
that's a very nice outfit
Every English
I didn't even watch that thing it looks to cringy
It's any news Network ever talking about video games
they can't back up a faulty claim
becuase it's literally not their fault...
oh not this shit again
im playing with friend back from hawaii next week
shoulda taken pics
who won
lol
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1hP9uCQi6-6-hsu_f6f5P_jb2urP3Hr7zTn6_fHeu24k/edit#
endgame units are straight up f2p
GBF tbh
rip
i wanted to see the B sides and the Core though
yeah Muffin's laugh is something.,..
this run is madness
and it's here
TAS bot great every year
yeah the Celeste race was really close
every rank from 1st dan is double the points of the previous
but im not grinding that nonsense out now
I can't even play the big boys until 4th dan
no 1 kyuu was the tutorial

that's actually kinda disturbing
I heard it was ok but never bothered playing
it's really not that confusing, there's just like 10 games to play
if you have a 3ds just get the 3ds game and watch the other two things on youtube
the 3ds game and some extras
waste of money
and it's gonna take time to play them all
I mean 1.5, 2.5 and 2.8 are probably pretty cheap now
it covers everything
what game
Lol same
Azami?
<#336297840529899522> while i think of how to type this
and I absoultely do not like censorship
yes
or plot
If it's something like an idiom or something it's at least understandable, but thigns like changing a character away from what the writters wrote is what I don't like
I always prefer to bring across the writer's intent
i mean that's the differnet between literal transtion and intent
I do not like that thought process AT ALL and do not like changing things outside the author or writer's intent. It's extremely subjective and often things like censorship are involved...
anyway as far as translation. I greatly dislike changing things in general no matter the language or country of origin
the monogatari series turns it on its head with Nadeko
its an old concept
I mean even if it wasn't japanese I don't like it
personally
I don't
at times
the xenoblade translation is...questionsable
blushy crushy lmao
looks like a Lalafell
https://gematsu.com/2018/07/the-world-ends-with-you-final-remix-details-new-elements-story-characters-more
is it though
implying that's hard?
Srsly
IVs in a Gacha game...
if it was anything like Obama in Gamble Fish it would be hilarious though
Lol
not that I'm gonna bother playing it
I mean why not
https://twitter.com/AzurLane_EN/status/1014330508510031872 amusing
also i read the manga and it's great. But barely any of it is TL'd
Hanebado
speaking of sports, new Badmiton anime is surprisingly good
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
easy
Got all the german ships from the event
sounds like bad game design
please
Spyro remastered yes
the fights in 6 are just so good though. Fighting the giant flying aircraft carrier and the railgun
that one was really good to
the plot was anime as fuck and gameplay was fantastic
Fires of Liberation was the best one
Ace Combat?
whaling the GFL and Azur lane gachas is relatively pointless. They make money off skins and shit
<:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
glare
I hear banks have lots of money
anyone play shadowverse, I need a private match for event daily
and i wasn't really interested in the game in the first place so eh
I mean i dont really care about that
everything i hear about this makes me want to play it less wwww
lol what
now if only we could get a new spyro game that's not trash
rigged game
run the event map twice and get that SSR drop instead
never get them
run 3-4 over 100 times for Kaga and Akagi
I've run 3-4 so many times to get Akagi......
just don't have any of your gun girls go on psycho rampages
but it's hip to be square
lol
but fucking San Diego is in the SSR right now
Azur Lane has rotating medal shop
oh
I doubt there actually is a pity roll number
confirmation bias
lol
why this in gaming
I don't preorder unless I have complete faith in the game. Last one I pre-ordered was Dangan Ronpa V3. Was not disappointed.
my yakuman dream
this is worse than loss <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<@!102691114762371072> my dreams are dead
They actually got good tl
the villains of the first two game sare literally the R4 and custom firmware lol
i like it
yeah
all of the plots of the main games are parallels of real life things like piracy and the rise and the fall of the dreamcast
Portalcraft was a mistake
Yukikaze broken as fuck in Azur lane lol
yes
anyway yeah
the way it's used in fate go is different
acsention increases level cap
NP level isn't acsending...
azur lane throws like a billion bulins at you so you never actually need duplicates to uncap
rip that game
like every other gacha game? This and azur lane the only two i know that require that.
Yeah I didn't really like the menus in gfl either
best girl <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
rip
too pure for this world
Jack is all the matters
I don't even whale and i have most of what i want *shrug*
there's also a rotating medal shop that sells specific ships including ssr
I haven't paid shit and have like all the best ships in the game lol
extremely
light/heavy/aviation
there's 3 gachas based on ship type
no
i need to unlock the 2nd floor for all my random furniture
why isn't there one in yours
I like my room
it's older so has more QoL features
similar
oh man i want this outfit https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/4e/AtagoNew_Year.png
this skill name lol
got a new ssr https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Atago
Emulator?
Fuckin whales
and playing AL
my phone is melting from the heat
i find it amusing that china is one of the least represented nations in this chinese game
I have no idea lol
no
Best Destroyer in the game at lv100, that lv80 is the best aircraft carrier in the game, the 99 is one of the best cruisers

lol
which is f2p
Celeste
Hollow Knight
Fallout 1 and 2 are so different. The ending to 1 was really good though.
fluffy tails won't come to me
I still don't have Tamamo
not Tamamo rip
Why even
Lol Da Vinci...
Elona
yeah that
<:GWcfcThonk:357907199928041473>
cuz that game was fucking sick
the game with that shadow monster?
Psychonauts
I actually didn't roll her once lol....
or had cuz i scrapped all but one of her
lol
worst SSR in the game
I have like 5 of her
I can't stop getting San Diegos
https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Montpelier
I accidentally spent 10 rolls on light construction and got a SSR i didn't have lol
I'm just fucking with you lol. But if you wanna get a signed card or something yeah you need several boxes...
not enough
that's not nearly enough card packs
there's a lot of famous voices in GFL and AL lmao
that would be silly
well they're not gonna rerecord the songs in english lol...
speaking of SSR, this one is voiced by Minori Chihara <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/Z46#Default
yeah
I stopped really caring about physical copies a while ago. They just get put in my attaic cuz i don't have room for them
force*time
jokes on you my skin is harder than steel
https://shadowverse.gamepress.gg/card/silva-ardent-sniper
yeah it's called acclerate
and her 3 mana effect is also broken
it's normally a 7 6/5 with stealth
that 6/5
it has an effect to play it for less for a different effect
make a 1/3 that gives you puppets at the start of the opponent's turn
enhance 5 polymorph
fair and balanced
well the gameplay for AL and GFL is very similar.
tried GFL for like a week and didn't really like it
azur lane
i prefer AL
rip Astolfo
now i had a Rider that doesn't suck lol
at least i didn't get nero caster
she does have one of the best NP animations though
please
that's best
that's Okita
wot
Well that's not raikou
"lets roll a few tickets on summer banner for raikou"
i played mario tennis on wii?
i actually like that armor...
can equip actual armor while looking fabulous kek
good
if it's key item is it just armor skin?
i wouldn't say downloading free dlc is jumping though that many hoops lol...
don't insult the chicken god
it does
no
or do that

8 mana 6/5 + 1/1 + 3/2 storm x3
get puppet engine going and then play orchid https://shadowverse.gamepress.gg/card/orchis-vengeful-puppet
i just played 2 of them as 2/2 that match
fuck that card
also found out that polymorph wokrs on Beautry and the beast
becomes that cost if you have the pp
this deck is totally balanced
so you get more of her
also Lococo can be copied by this guy https://shadowverse.gamepress.gg/card/hamelin
https://shadowverse.gamepress.gg/card/lococo-little-puppeteer
and it stacks
lmao
it's called being broken
i mean im not the one bringing gender in, im saying cuz it's the MC...
i mean i still think it makes sense that it would be resticted to the MC but rip bad MC
it just feels like a silly complaint
i mean he's the main character isn't he...
whats the difference even
and this is one that's just stupid
this is an example of it being fine
I mean I kinda don't care about fanservice designs if they don't go too overboard.
ok that doesn't make any sense
I don't need armor in my games to be 100% serious
that armor doesn't even look that bad. It's not like it's bikini mail...
https://youtu.be/a2ef40jBPIs
doesn't that game has a gacha for outfits or some shit
madmen marrying bullins
they're uncap fodder lmao
these two are not real units
this fucking madman

speaking of meme oathing
laffey's lanes are adorable
some of the AL girls have some odd lines but most are fine
I actually never rolled her when i was actually playing lol
wtf is her name
oh wait that's not that cat girl
<:GWnanamiSawakoWut:399930895739650059>
>using NTW as your sectretary
Thompson has some good lines
yeah they look nice
*shrug*
can't take video with phone

they also have Live 2d thing
all of the starter ships and Akashi
it's not fully animated. Azur lane has a few fully animated characters
also gonna buy this outfit https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/5/58/SaratogaSummer.png
fucking discord
incidentally you get wedding dress outfit for free for marrying a ship that has one
i waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaant it https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/4/47/LaffeyNew_Year.png
I really want Laffey's Kimono but have to wait for new years <:GWnanamiWhenDspairGetsAtU:402195467334844428>
https://azurlane.koumakan.jp/w/images/a/a4/Graf_Zeppelin.png
buy im buying that first one
i prefer her default
Can just buy outfits outright
that's so dumb...
im making a build a bear workshop on the enemy's side of the board
but he's also a berserker
he can get the highest hp in the game with his NP
actually several of them. I want Enkidu still
lel
my best Lancer is a 3*
obviously doesn't know shit about team comp
lol...
everything about her is adroable
>only cuz she has a cowboy hat
man i wonder
i wish Astoflo didn't suck
oh right i should farm up Malter so i have a rider that i can actually use
would never roll on a double rate up unless i wanted both
there usually is
also check to see if there's a single rate up day
i wouldn't
i still dont have Limit Zero over
i wish i had a MLB kscope but that's not gonna happen
put on Jalter and press win
that one good too
on shuten and Saberlot
that CE is bust ass
oh that
who?
i've been playing for two years... <:GWnanamiChenMeh:402195817877864448>
Also <:GWowoHehe:358278238675664896>
I mean I find Fate go fun or i would have stopped playing after getting Jack
if he's not on rate up it's not happening
I want to trade
I got semiramis trying to roll for tamamo...
still waiting for Saber Astolfo ~~literally never~~
that jack is cool but it's also never getting put in the game
actually that's a lie, if i ever fucking roll Tamamo I'll grail her to 100
unless they actually release some other Jack or something I dunno who i would even use them on
guess i spent some when i wasn't looking
oh my 14 grails
I wish
I need to figure out what to do with my 16 grails
Taiga is great
hits decently hard cuz of his passives and skills
that's why she needs an actual master to cover that weakness
also being able to use her abilities properly and not get ganged up on by like 4 servents lol
*shurg*
if Jack had an actual master she might have been relevent to the plot in Apocryphia
if only
I dont think you need to play 4d chess to figure out kotomine is hilariously evil
just happened to
still need that Kotomine Rasputan demiservent
becuase Kotomine hand knifed the other one https://i.imgur.com/wlEYYn2.png
https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RJsoXFLjwYU/maxresdefault.jpg
Lostbelt spoilers
so i'd never roll any of those
and i don't want her
rip that nonsense
oh da vinci on rate up for everything
i have like half the channels muted lol...
But eh
This server already bloated with too many channels tbh...
AI is dumb as hell until if finds a way to screw over the player country
I don't think the AI is very good at this game either lol
I dunno im bad at HoI
lol
yeah that might turn into a problem

UK trying to backstab you

http://typemoon.wikia.com/wiki/Saberface
steamroll city
oh my god every enemy in this new chapter is a berserker giant
Sakura and boudica was hardly even that bad

```The SPP-1 Underwater Pistol was made in the USSR for use underwater by Soviet frogmen as an underwater firearm. ``` I wonder if this thing is used underwater
doing that challenge before Foreigners existed
oh right
I think there's a part of the story where he actually has 12 lives
it's one of the only bond CEs in the game that's actually good lol
his bond CE gives him 3 lives
server lag apparently

well that was easy
actually working out
Tfw wasn't expecting boss fight
I turn off autocorrect cuz it tries to correct any random japanese words i type lol

<:GWowoHehe:358278238675664896>
