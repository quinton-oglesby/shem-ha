ohk ty
what are shinais?
bluray support the franchise
https://www.symphogear-xv.com/products/XVpackage01.php
zizzl
only thing keeping me going was the music of that season
gx wasnt that bad.... i only rewatched it last week.....
dino when u figure out how to move on pls tell me, nothing is working for me
^
season one is special compared to the rest, so yea it should stay the way it is
as long as we get more content for symphogear, i can live happily
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
guess we all just hav to watch each movie more then once
small details <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
even better
5 movies doesnt sound to bad
Id rather we get something with the custodians coming, n the world has to find new relics to recreate more symphogears, n in some plot reason fragments of the of 7 relics were recreated for one final battle
That's a dark turn of events
Ok that's cool then
Did the Gundam model first or the anime?
Ok
Keijo is manga
Touch√©
Anime was a mistake
There's loads, yea but off the top of my head, are there any that's reached 5 seasons?
That's honestly kind of sad, like symphogear is easily one of the best original anime series we have
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
True..... They're mostly normies
I thought he was going to publicly present symphogear like he did the index season......
Didn't gigguk just laugh at it?
So I went n watch the newest Rambo to try n numb my heart but it didn't work....
Ofc symphogear is number one, it's legit the only anime I watched this season
Nana probably cost a pretty penny
Well if anything we can look forward to he new va's improvement
Yabai
Maybe kirika n shirabe as mentors
Thank you I feel less empty
Well honestly I feel so much better knowing aoi not liking the role
Awww
Fair enough
Too niche?
O7
Boi
oh
Delta had spicy songs too
Also macross is kind of like symphogear
But my point is here's not that many
I just hope kirika isn't to expensive
I miss them times, my Chris figure was like 120 now for same quality is like 200
Hmm I'm getting the kirika one but I was more so hoping to get a bunny girl series of each of the characters like Chris
Ohk
Aren't we getting a new kirika figure
Maybe hoping for a fresh start is probably for the best
If the va's are suffering I rather not have them continue
Yea vocalist for fripside which was a good surprise
Oh yea her yeeting Solomon's cane <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I feel like that's a lesser thing that should be on your mind
Probably helicoptered to the crate, jumped in, then sang
Great now I need this now....
It'll be worth it <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Xtreme vibes, waiting for full version before evaluation
Ssj is the only gear that has flight abilities outside of ex-drive
pretty sure im getting mild depression from the show finishing
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
So it went complete over the estimate
I'd kill for that
If we had a proper epilogue, I think it would satisfy a lot of ppl
Why would ppl not want a continuation
tell me to not lose hope
thank you

<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Sforzando no Zankyo why u no in vol.2
Hikasa <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Hurts the most when u know the lyrics, learn it was a reply to, eiai promise then read eiai promise then cry... Cry alot
Yea, but when we did get it, it hit like a ton of bricks
No bully elfnien
Even before knowing the lyrics both songs were so nice! After knowing the lyrics I shed a few tears, yea theyre all really good!
If I had to choose kimi ga nakanai sekai or Kimi dake ni  were the best coupling songs this season
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I miss Chris calling basa senpai
Carol/elfnien cover art when <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Isn't there one more next week?
so like wat nana said 5 days worth
thanks! first we need to hear an announcement, so i can plan everything
after an eternity, finally finished live 2018. cant wait for XV's live but at the same time, kind of dread the fact im probably not going to be able to get tickets for it <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
im clearly not good at handling this
hey the last seven days has been the longest week ive felt all year, which really says how much a show can effect someone,
hmmm i always thought to myself that chris as the seasons went on, used more refined weapons as a way to reflect for personal growth n skills when using the gears, from just spray n pray to a bow n pistols.
im like blowing college living funds for this BD
hng cant wait
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
no spoilers on kiri-chans transformation
congratz! still waiting for mine
mine was definitely carols returns n her finishing the ep with Sforzando no Zanky≈ç
cliffhangers are fine as long as u know a conclusion well happen
id watch that
but of course
23% vat <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
then its just my country, im from ireland
i ordered mine from cdjapan, if u know anyother place i can buy it from pls do tell
finally got vol.1 bd, did anyone here have to pay for an extra customs charge?
even now we still have a good few songs waiting to be released
all of the songs are good
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
is the song thats coupled with their actually in show songs
<:DMJii:549819519082692608>
Honestly I was just saying that as a way to escape the fact symphogear is done until further notice
<@506219877724454929>  it's worth the shot
Semi while fighting
Idols mechas n singing
Dino delta is good shit
Coa spoilers
I can't say much
Yea just watch season 1
I see Mecha I like
Well
It's good
But froniters spicier
Delta's good
