or at least fucked up descriptions
its a test on whether i can do horror-esque things
No. No you don't get it. How could you possibly hope to understand the things I've seen?

The horrors I heard, the colors I've tasted. It was real. It is something man himself cannot bring to understand. That these are pages never to be written, simply because it has already burned the papers before the ink touched them. If you could give it a shape it would be as if you're imagining a new color.

It was the birth of death and the void given shape, the manifestation of the end of time. The screams the Moon had made when it was struck. The complete oblivion of every heaven and hell. The complete beauty of apathy, with flames that continued to frolic across the ocean. Total order, total chaos, fused together. It could hear sounds with its mouth, see sights with its ears. A nameless thing given life by its shrines, wombs that have become its flesh.

You still don't get it do you? Of course you won't, none of you will. If you want proof then dissect my eyes and wear them, wear my skin as yours. Perhaps then you will be able to hear the things it's written for me.

PAIN.
but man no more lycoris 😔
oOP
lycoris final ep so good
||America would tear itself apart completely||
||"THE LYCORIS ARE REAL!!!!"

"ITS JUST A MOVIE!!!!!!"||
||America wouldn't be much different tbh||
||the public would eat anything up||
Whaddahel
Is this real
Is
||these mfkas do impossible feats and they do it anyway like its an average tuesday||
||Lycoris is Symphogear without the singing and armor||
||HE IS THOUGH||
||to be frank, Majima is still out there even though he fell down a CONSIDERABLE height||
Things like Attack on Titan, One Piece, Dragon Ball, Pokemon
The really popular stuff when you ask someone "name an anime"
then theres fucking one piece with 1000 episodes
no matter how i look at attack on titan, something about it bothers me
for some odd reason i just dont like most mainstream media or am just not interested in it
based
cheese, my favorite character in lycoris
||i love that cheese's first decision after getting a new heart transplant is to fuckin run ALL THE WAY TO THE BEACH|| (lycoris spoilers)
||makes I Wanna Stay At Your House a bit fucked up ain't it cuz David's now got a new home somewhere else||
If you ain't got nowhere else to go but the sea, might as well <:FudouSmile:672848303632678942>
instead, kill them
i dont understand why people like him
i get its a satire but the main character is a grade a asshole
i also cannot bring myself to watch konosuba
the easiest solution
which is what contributes to the business
and they do it by literally fucking buying them
what makes me angry is that the protagonists claim they'll free the slave character
they put up these interesting gimmicks but so many decide to go down the drain
blehhhh
yeah honestly, most isekai anime is just
what are your thoughts on the recent isekai boom
and he just comes in and kills them??
the w h a t ?
me when i watch someone die to the 100th truck: i wonder how this will go
tensura literally did that by fucking STABBING the dude and the ai following his exact wants
when will they actually employ interesting ways for the protagonist to get in to the other world
so goddamn MANY default to this and im fucking standing here like "when will this nightmare be over."
just a thing, hate how they just kill the protagonist first by
using a fucking truck.
playing it straight is one thing (can be done right or wrong, to make it clear), playing it so damn straight it curveballs into a fucking wall is another
tbh, any trope can become braindead if you use it in the blandest way possible
i'd be more surprised if a ||church actually acted as a church||
typical
easy gay plots 💀
im not interested in the anime
like im sure its good but its not for me
i prefer tensura myself for the comedy and the actual small bit of worldbuilding they fucking bothered to do
Re:Zero is something i wouldnt watch, its........fuckin something
nicest way to describe the isekai boom
~~haha thats my nickname~~ me when isekai <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>
GOD
everything about that is so fuckin NASTY bro
EUUUGHHHH
shield hero my beloathed
EW????
ALSO JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES SENSE DOESNT MAKE IT ANY LESS FUCKED UP
I THOUGHT IT WAS JUST ONCE WITH RAPHTALIA
HE DOES???
why not kill the fuckin trader in the first place or actually shut down the damn business
ive always hated the "buying slaves to save slaves" trope
shield hero :dread:
the smartphone one is an example
i'd say the isekai boom is meh but a lot of isekai anime recently are fucking balls
ehhh its not clicking for me
ive never watched inuyasha
i have made only one exception to the rule thus far (the slime one but its usually because its funny how so many of them simp for like. this dude.) but otherwise its vomit-inducing
Pre-emptive safety is often the best safety
fUCK
chisataki, the gayest fucking thing in the universe
~~filthy degenerate~~
how does it smell chisato
its a poisonous flower
understandable though, there are people actually stupid enough to try smoking a red spider lily
chisato sniffing takina's hair however was NOT what i expected the eyecatch to be
doesnt look too bad, if a little bland

i mean i guess technically
phillip but hes unhinged
it is a cool aesthetic though i wont lie
she just like me fr
very good
GOD
why
no
nrut
it looks so ridiculous
i cant get over his fucking crying face
jesus lord
naruto's still going??
i want to die reading that
It's a weird situation in general
Will still surprise you all the same though
That can either be good, eh or bad depending on what the context is
Things that just come out of nowhere stun the human mind
Ye that
I guess it's bc of how jarring it is but that's only for a bit
I don't think it should matter much tbh, continuities do different things and that's fine
Scoob does seem to flip flop a lot depending on the continuity
I am very confused <:CarolShock:730816714345938956>
I honestly can't really care enough for it considering I haven't been much of a Scoob fan but I am intrigued
Not bad all things considered but is the story still good or not
Idk, representation ig?
Scooby Doo is weird
It does seem to be well within my interests enough
Yea I'll be watching the prologue and ep 1 first
Ou alralr
I'll watch it tomorrow or after if I don't forget
Well it does only have a prologue and 2 EPs rn so I can catch up easily
So I can just dive straight into Gwitch
Should I be watching Utena first then
Technically??
So I do have to watch it for context
Is seeing Gundam Utena required for context
I currently have no interest in Gundam atm but I'm seeing so much of WoM that I'm curious myself
Should I watch The Witch from Mercury
Question
he somehow looks wrong in every angle possible

tbh, ive actually never really watched the gundam franchice, never caught my eye til i saw GWitch pop up here and there in the server
loved it
aside from that, very good episode
yeah this show's got me hooked among other things
in watching episode 1, i have witnessed 3 great moments of gay, two metalass robot fights and witnessed the gays sharing one braincell
yea i think the two are gay
_ _
i did
`woman`
"nice to meet you my groom"
I WITNESSED THE DUDE GET DESTROYED AND WATCHED A MOMENT OF GAY DO YOU THINK IM O K A Y

im going to have a field day with this episode
AND gay
one braincell baby
i think this is heading in a direction
how many episodes in each season
ooooh
i dont watch old media very often but could be a good place to start
if i ever do decide to watch the rest of the franchise, i may start with 00
WHAT???
the price to pay for being a franchise
its why i dislike things like grimdark
emotionally draining in a near instant
i can handle suffering, its just that i cant handle it in large amounts
gundam sounds like a very wild franchise
i also do enjoy fantasy and science fiction from time to time
Symphogear is part of the action category
i do like action and adventure in my own time
oh my god
gay is a good promise
fair enough
`why am i getting recommends based off gay alone`
any good recommendations for me if i decide to go through with the rest of the franchise
symphogear is one thing, gundam is another whole bag
i would DIE before i even complete the whole thing
H A H
However I do not want to see them constantly crying every episode because it eventually gets annoying
I can stand child characters well enough
They're very loud
I can bear with toddlers but admittedly I do not like them either <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Annoying child characters are child characters done wrong
0080 is on my "maybe watch" list
ten what are you planning.
ten.
lycoreco beloved
~~it is not.~~
i dont feel very confident in that answer
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
ye it gets complex at the end as i heard but im gonna watch it regardless, is pretty cool
is so good
i love godzilla man
on another note, Godzilla SP is on 9anime as well so im gonna binge that tomorrow
00 will be a part of my "probably will watch" list
digestable
Isekai genre <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359>
planning to watch the frieren anime once it drops
the prologue hit me like a fucking freight train
DO YOU FEEL IT NOW
do you feel it now raiden
thats what theyre saying
yes
supposedly, the usual 2 cours
i still wonder how tf they made RODAN NOODLES of all things
was damn good i tell you
finished the first four episodes
theyre eating fucking rodan noodles
THEY MADE RODAN A MERCH FUCK ME
Pelops-2 is pretty fun
i'll read the manga then after SP
manga's good?
yooooo rhedosaurus
premise drew me in with the good reviews but i have my doubts
im also planning to watch Reincarnated as a Sword once im finished with it
Godzilla SP has been fun so far
Apparently Mario is just normalass Chris Pratt

Watch the teaser and you'll get it
Velma looks even more like a family guy character 💀
#notmyshaggy
cant wait to see what scooby doo fuckin looks like
mfkin dream boy
eugh

the new designs for the velma show
twitter 💀
HE LOOKS A WEBTOON CHARACTER TOO
WHY DOES FRED LOOK SO WHITE
DAPHNE WHADDAHEL
SHAGGY!?!?!?!??
shes always been shirabe
<:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
what the fuck
if you say so
what about it
what kind of special
like
What the fuck
Even so, they can still make it good
They just refused to
i think they're everybody's if we're being frank here
godDAMN was it goated
finally finished godzilla SP
i can name a few others but thats the one i thought of first
obvious but Fuuto Pi
the way they handle the effects is very good and i like the way it looks
eat this fruit to instantly be funny
It is
OOO has been one hell of a ride for me, loved it ever since
this is poorly written fanfiction isnt it
what

that wasnt what i was referring to but tru
i swear theyre gonna break so many school rules
they are totally platonic, mm mhm
LISTEN SYMPHOGEAR DID IT IN A MILITARY SIGN OF ALL THINGS, WE GOTTA BE ON THE WATCH
theyre such *best friends* arent they
"we're no strangers to love"
Not a very good one that's for sure
AUGH
WHAT!?!?!?
THIS ISNT EVEN THE WORST PIECE OF OFFICIAL MEDIA???
did anyone actually even STAND just reading it
this felt like watching a goddamn train go so off the rails it completely destroyed an orphanage by itself, followed by totalling the Pentagon and THEN becoming a trainwreck after it blows up with the force of a megaton missile
what the fuck do i even grasp at here
this is.............
HUH???
i
<:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
im looking this up
"mechanical designer" he certainly did design something alright
fuck me <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
||is that usually expected||
i have a problem
ive been listening to the GWitch op for hours now
the worst kind of Fudou
||"ight imma head out and I'm taking you with me"||
||obviously but Elnora is a wee bit more concerning||
||I've got a slight, slight feeling that Suletta's mom might come up as an antagonist given the......circumstances||
||nothing homo about this||
||ah yes, very straight indeed||
**the credits were definitely something alright**
so how much gay was in this episode according to your calculations
||AND hes egotistical
maybe slightly i think||
||miorinewhatthefuckareyoudoing||
||one more for the "because i said so" sentence||
||scoring double dickhead points there||
||Delling doubles as an abusive dad AND a Jeff Bezos-esque ceo||
||a drone??? Aerial??????? THAT BIG MFKA????????????????||
||"are you a witch" frickn rude you dont just ask someone that||
okay fair enough
||also things getting BAD bad in ep 2||
||is it Delling or that pink mfka's dad whos the villain||
I'll put it on the list
Hmmm
Fakin ell
Should I watch Yuuki Yuuna
||WAIT A FUCKING SECOND HERE||
||........wait a fucking second||

the Velma series isnt returning scooby doo <:CarolStare:336656462287994882>
GET OFF THE STAGE
nOOOOOOOO <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
probably for "realism" or some shit
I DONT KNOW
i swear to GOD
had to let that out
***THIS SHIT AINT FUCKING SCOOBY!!!!!!!!*** <:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
if it aint got the doo
i know
||getting mixed opnions on gwitch here||
||ueeeeeeee||
||hopefully||
||its emotionally draining for me and kinda takes me out of it, like what else am i supposed to expect||
||ehhhh im not going to lie, copious amounts of suffering tends to put me off <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>||
||is copious amounts of suffering something i should expect||
this is good
F u c k m e
I just like funny robot
to be fair, ||he likely got his jerkassery from his dad which sad but also he could be better than that like man cmon||
guel yes
||what if its not on her birthday though||
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
what
wh
as in the food or something else
shakesphere was on some shit
truly the gundam ever
💀
what
im gonna keep watching gwitch and see what happens but having the knowledge that gundam can dip into deep suffering is now ingrained in my mind
oeeeee <:ElfneinDrowning:336656417035517952>
Yes
Is very fun
I like big robot
GWitch is the first Gundam show I'm watching and with all that being said I have no idea what to expect
I'm in fear
Are Gundam discussions usually like this <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
What's going on
🧍‍♂️
||DAMMIT ELNORA WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU THINKING||
||gay conversion via robot violence||
||fair||
||I THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT GUEL||
||THATS WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT||
||OH||
||its also a flimsy justification for anything||
||being forced to marry anyway is still terrible||
||none of it does||
||while theres definitely very gay subtext, being forced into engagement isnt a good reason for. any sexuality||
she was ready to beat the shit out of him
||"'no bitches' they said. i'll show them. i'll show all of them." -Suletta||
||with every duel won, she gets a marriage proposal||

||the fucking tsubasa out of the two||
they did work on things such as a few Batman shows, an episode of Teen Titans, Godzilla: The Series and co-produced on Shield Hero
how the hell did they MANAGE that
and yet here it is
this feels like a gag that shouldnt exist
this is real
are youfuckin kidding me
if a gacha game anime could somehow do those two steps correctly and ignore the rest, then Marvel is already doing something terribly wrong

tf going on in gwitch <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
that is all

the big sus
"THEY CANCELLED THE LIVE ACTION MOVIE BOYS, LET 'ER RIP"
The poor little meow meow anime
Planning on watching Bocchi the Rock tomorrow
But consider: it is wet outside
Power went out, I cannot watch more Bocchi until then <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
nihil bread
ONNA........
holy shi-
thie entire anime is off its rocker
oh my GOD hitori
absolutely fucking mad
all of these people are insane
💀
shes like if the ancient greeks had a god of social anxiety
god fucking help her
i love her
this woman is literally the most pathetic little thing ive seen
bocchi the rock time
yeah
ooooh

gay people..............
Someone just retire him already holy
Has happened before in Alola
huh.......??
Isn't........isn't clearly expressing romantic interest what makes romance romance in the first place
sasuga game freak
when the pokemon anime goes into a state of catatonia like the games
tf am i looking at here
takes off glasses
in what manner
ah yes, of course my tweet is harmful and totally not referring to any fictional character
also love that theres a "did we get this wrong" option
"most tweeters dont post replies like this" probably because people with common sense wouldnt want to participate in whatever pandemonium Twitter is doing
fatherless behavior 💀
we figured it out
all it took him was a father figure to win

all of them
hard choose
who didnt
loser behavior
oh my god this woman
Loved the SAKANAAAAAAAA scene
💀
I like it when character:)
Jesus Christ lycoris really does get everything down to a T
AINT NO WAY
They're such good parallels and it makes me all giddy
Chisato is effectively "violence isn't always the answer but pacifism is not always the perfect solution" and it portrays that well, while Takina is "sometimes we have to do the necessary things but we must stop when they do more harm than good"
It really does show both sides well
**aside from destroying entire car doors**
Yknow
They do a really great job at portraying it's properties too such as their ineffectiveness at long range
LycoReco fashion hits so hard
||fuck this still hurts||
ryo has a good sense of humor
Whether ironically or unironically though I have no clue
I'm pretty sure some do
||damn..........he used the power of Twitter to create his clones......||
Fuckboy Elan is punchable I think
She will be there waiting forever
She will never know the truth

Rice
We have another gohan girl
AND the hack
Considering the leaks that's frankly understandable
truly, toei twitter be fucky
offtopic, i greatly enjoy the character designs in Healin' Good
given Toei's hold on copyright, well.......
maybe
yeah i think they could pull it off
looks at Toei's Digimon Ghost Game
i'd be more surprised if they decided to just show it in full
given its mainly a kids' show they'll probably water it down but at least its better than nothing
yeah, for all its showyness the idol industry and idolism in general is pretty fucked
something something about hopes and dreams i think
random thought but an idol theme would be interesting if that hasnt been done yet
oh yeah hows DeliPre for yall
we'll just have to wait n see
hmmm
lycoreco novel reached 250,000 copies sold
also an excuse to post this art

"*sigh* goddammit suletta my finances are already being tanked as is"
We all know how skies in anime usually turn out
I meant to ask what it could be about
Ye I know, I just worded it wrong
Wonder what this one is about
real
Oh boy Suletta sunday
ryo is hilarious

hell
bocchi dies fr
it was
i havent looked much into Kaiju No. 8 but it definitely looks interesting
OI
excited for this one as a kaiju fan
"i spend my days cursing you losers" indeed
https://twitter.com/lycoris_recoil/status/1603676731541520384
shes fucking dead

bocchi over <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
MADE ME SNORT SO HARD
tHIS FUCKIN QUICK SHOT
YES
love that she isnt "i may be stupid" and is "i may be stupid, BUT" while pointing out that shes still wrong in spite of her intentions
while i saw the slavery thing coming, its a lot more justified personally considering that there isnt much someone her age can do about it (unless im wrong, i watched the episode on Muse Asia where shes stated to be 15)
watched the first ep too, it's surprisingly good
**the creature**
gotta do something to make ends meet after all
**something**
It's uh
Watching New Game rn
the kiriverse begins
its pretty good, im gonna b waatching more 👍
just watched the first episode of it
more lycoris content..........
"JODIO.....KISAMA DA....."
Sounds about right
Are you okay Mel
The jojolands is real
i like how aggressive november rain's design is
||real||
holy shit youre right
