Hi new people.  Wow <@142813774833778688> you're a Touhou fan too I see.
Yes.
Wow for a popular anime (most large fandoms aren't so polite) people here are friendly.

I was led here by the announcement of a stream being hosted with the show from the very beginning starting tomorrow.
Also by chance it looks like I know some of you from the Touhou Project discord TOTALLY by chance!  ‚ù§
Thanks for the welcome.  I am a returning anime fan and had an excellent recommendation to watch Symphogear from friends.
Greetings everyone.
YES I WAS!
Oh wow cool!

<@220201140141162496> Wow another Touhou fan!
OMG that's so hilariously wrong.
