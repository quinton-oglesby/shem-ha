Due to the announcement of the end of service of global Symphogear XD UNLIMITED, the wiki that was being developed for it has been converted to the JP version of the game. Translated content is still being added. If you find any errors in translation please let me know at the revived <#703319690839326860> channel. ~~(Also, drop me any requests on what units you would like to see added first.)~~

Also, images links are in queue of being fixed on Fandom's new system, so please use the navigation bar or front page navigation table instead for now.

https://symphogear-xdu-english.fandom.com/wiki/Symphogear_XDU_English_Wiki
Hello, Symphogear XDU players! A new wiki is in the works geared toward the English release of the Symphogear XD UNLIMITED mobile game. There are many exciting features already in planning, and input from players in moving toward a useful wiki will be necessary. That is why we are opening a wiki editing channel right here on /r/Symphogear's Discord. Report any issues here: <#703319690839326860>

**But before reporting problems** please kind in mind certain points of development may be slowed or bugged by Fandom's current revamping of the underlying wiki system. Some basic features of the wiki are currently unavailable (such as the image links on the front page). Details about this are provided on the wiki front page.


If you are on a mobile device, Desktop mode view of the website is currently (and generally) recommended (if your phone's browser allows).  https://symphogear-xdu-english.fandom.com/wiki/Symphogear_XDU_English_Wiki

he's too fast
How do you follow Sanic?
<a:GottaDerpFast:515688718900658177>
Giga power <a:MikuTriggered:608862339487367178>
dang no sanic emoji's
followed back
I removed a few
<@!145234510684880896> Found you <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
same
oki
oh
I need Carol, but I'm not mutual
Imma wait and see what happens lol
Given what was stated in the news recently, they may very well ban people.
got it now
<a:sanic:683467199155011632>

what's wrong with rage? <a:triggeredd:532218935366385664>
I need those too
I'll be doing green carol for a while
I got 1 Giga Miracle Crystal today...out of the 15 required. <:MichaSmug:336657136065052673>
MDP
Just figure out how sanic hacked the apk and do it yourself <a:banningINTENSIFIES:415306394917666816>
<:suffering:489138251727372309>
At least you get to experience the crushing difficulty of playing the game for real.
I can spare 8 of them
Whoop 16/15 Giga Miracle Crystals. Now to figure out how I'm gonna get giga power. <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
Either way, they'll never catch him <a:sanic:683467199155011632>
What did he say?
i.e. do crap damage? lol
I see them on Hard D-type Carol raids sometimes
<:kannaInspect:354379989652865046>

<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
Which healer is that?
Do people usually put on other types to kill the raid boss minions?
I have a decent P team, but that's about it. my PvP team has 4 P and 1 H on it <:SmugMicha:574344341103837185> Hence why Giga Power farming is going to be even more painful.
lol
My units suck in general
And then giga power suffering <:suffering:489138251727372309>
EYYYY

9 more to go
What if they weren't even talking about the raids? lol
<@!113155650434904064> I have space now
19 turns and nobody has died yet. That's definite improvement.
Okay, will do when I exit raid
time to test out if LU XD Shirabe makes any difference from last night.
followed
not sure if I have followed you but I thought I was on your raid last night
I will attack it in a moment
I didn't' know there was an XD Miku. I just knew about broken Shem ha Miku and distorted mirror miku (whatever you call that)
yeah, still need to LU MDP Chris
still got no idea what hexa quests are yet lol I probably should look it up.
nice
It helps a lot when said characters are MLB. The struggle of being a low budget player. I was lucky to have gotten MLB 4* I Shirabe in the limited draws I have done. Helped a lot during ~~poweraid~~ power raids.
Raids are actually kind of fun ~~for masochists~~
I've been doing raids without hax, so even if they sent down a nuke to catch him, I'd be out of the radiation zone. lol
~~I even missed the beginning bugs fuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuck~~
Maybe they caught a different hacker. :v
ya
yee

followed and entering now
thanks
<@!127991170201681920> Can you spare any follower spots?
Sadly, I'm stuck in tactics 2 rn
I wonder if I set up a team for red carol
INT raid scary <:KirikaScared:672584678993297431>
which carol is it?
like every time lol
I still need to get the last copy of welfare kanade before I can upgrade.
P carol wasn't as bad as I expected, but her burn is still annoying.
I and P stuff.
Been hoping for INT stuff from P-Carol
we pause as soon as we enter
tech
I noticed the techs being in weekly, but thought they rotated. I guess not? xD
If they rerun XD Maria, I'm gonna need  techs <a:MariaMURIII:576244673085964308>
Some tech crystals would be nice
tank chu
I would like a $100 google play gift card ðŸ‘€
It's a lie
<:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595> at 50% HP now
lol
Have to make a team for tech. 1 moment
10 now
have a heart
1 body giga
I got 2 giga from tech
nein
I don't have a team really set up for tech lmao
same
lol
still waiting on 1?
I think they were talking about something else lol
People going to complain no matter what. lol
<@!107532017809260544> When they finally stop spamming events, people complain about dedgaem.
If they ban everyone who has been on the train, it may be harder for the game to survive, though. lol
A lot of people said that about Magireco global and it's still going strong.
F

U

N
but even then you can strike out
3 tech crystals
whew

I really don't think I've seen a giga crystal without getting top 3 as well tbh
ya
I didn't get 1 drop yesterday off of natural ap
Cheruiel's Tech raid is going to end in less than an hour, and it's in the yellow right now.
<:thisisfine:425512197729419274>
Now there are 2 raids
whoooops
I accidentally created another Tech raid when I had meant to join <@!192304778938679296>
I gotta go to bed <:MichaSleepy:586957502306975744>
1 giga tech crystal

still worth
I can also help
YES 6 Giga Tech crystals. Now I can focus on Miracle raids.
<a:MariaMURIII:576244673085964308>
to tech types for up to 7 turns when fully awakened
Run XD Maria for poison immunity.

Just need more good T's <a:MariaShake:493803268850319360>
almost
Ah, the raid boss is doing the T pose
There is a T-pose joke somewhere in there.
<a:RYOUKAI:581602471101595664>
Yeah, I noticed your name on the list lol
Anybody else gonna join Cheruiel's tech raid? It's down to 671k / 2.2 million hp

Mine was already taken down ironically.
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
congrats and me, too.
int is not my friend, but I joined.
It feels less notable later in the battle to me
idk
assuming its from carol
The poison stops, though.
10 Giga Miracles <a:roomoney:495306367578406943>
That was close <a:AworrySweat:543522251887214602>
I haven't seen her stop using heal debuff.
5 giga int crystals. P Carol finally pays up.
got places to go gotta follow my rainbow

Tech raid <:poggers:314435788169281537>
whoops I thought I was in global chat
hot pinkish red for B
blood red for P
orangishy red for H
lol
What is orange? Heart?
https://tenor.com/view/nipple-hussle-im-in-danger-gif-13918867
ignite jii is dangerous
uuuuu
genocide of all lolis
how many lolis do we have to beat?
yeah, whenever she feels like dropping them
Intelligence is hard without the body to back it up.
they pair perfectly together tho
Getting gold from gold quests is nice, too.
Still choosing between one or the other, I'd rather have LU XD shirabe
Don't have lots of money to throw around ðŸ˜¢
I was more concentrated on XD jii, too.
really? I should get over there
pew pew
The only good noise is dead noise
I was stuck in an EX stage
~~My~~ body is ready
Any raids going down?
when I really just want more burnbasa <:NoLikeSword:619781891255566336>
I've been getting surplus dr jii for some reason.
<:ShiraBean:661294258795446326>
It'll get easier once I max Maria
to get the giga's
I'm also going for XD Kirika, but I'm still refining my Tech team.
And it only took 2 arena battles
sniped raid <:smugbob:479611221281341442>
I don't use anybody other than P types in this raid. idk what people use.
Both adds are down now
<@!192304778938679296> <:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>  is down
Pretty close
I also joined the D raid
When you leave, it keeps the damage?
need to beat boss
Still stuck in EX level
It's ignite chris.

period.
I'm drinking that poweraid right now.
I woould like some more giga melody. I got plenty of giga power.
I got a Body raid up

I thought the provoke buff from Micha was supposed to redirect most of the attacks toward her.
How is that possible?
It's a good place to start.
INT shirabe healers are helpful.
oh rite
what body shirabe
also revive jii
haha
<a:PandaFiretruck:691801328774676550>
Body raids be like
T-posing squid
Jackpot! 7 Giga Body Crystals <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
fire dess
CPU too dumb for fire death
I still need 2 more giga body. It just sucks I have to babysit these raids if I want to do decent damage.
Sometimes
<:YAMERO:576248182376497155>
Don't forget R A G E
It's almost July tho
<:morryswordfish:701967518876827738>
<:MikuSmug:655125664986300457>
I got a tech raid going if anyone wants to come bop it. <:irohaclub:674664474434732032>
<@!195044406343106560> I'm going in to kick the crap out of your carol raid.
Putting in Dr. Ver just for the boss bait.
Getting RB/LU materials for Vanessa is rough

Without rolling for more units, this may take a while. <:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
It seems that she's able to keep up in the beginning of the raid, but as it progresses, it gets harder. This might be due to the additional enemies still being alive.
I may have have just gotten lucky dozens of times, but she was keeping up with it most of the time (when starting the raid fresh)
If you don't get sudden death the first round, XD Serena will not be overwhelmed. Otherwise, you pray to RNGesus she doesn't kill you during the wait time.

Did anybody else catch the clickbait crunchyroll posted? Makes a pretty great comment section. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
Fudou has clearly gone mad with power.
Miku always gets the best gear.
huh
Oof. GX is pretty much a blur to me. So many forgettable things happened.
Wait, people didn't die when they were killed?
Despite massacring hundreds+ of people
But eating disorders, never experienced them firsthand.
I couldn't be partnered with someone who is depressed all the time, personally. It would wear me down.
Oof, looking after people with disorders is tough.
I do wonder if it would have reached this point had it not been for the pandemic. There are a lot of unhappy people right now. It sounds like throwing a lit match on gasoline.
True. Someone could always push it to the next level.
If they were shooting to kill, that's different
They aren't shooting real bullets, so it's not as controversial.
Some FedEx truck looter got dragged and run over to his death. Protesters tried to stop an SUV, and it back up over some 
 kid who was trying to block and or beat on it. A man tried to assault a kid with a sword to protect his shop and got beaten.

When the military gets there, they ain't playing.
There has been quite a bit of violence demonstrated in the protests.
It's usually a bad sign when US military is called in
https://twitter.com/KEEMSTAR/status/1266914561095094272

Looks like those protests have escalated a little too quickly. <:morrymaria:702698783531859988>
Everything this last year has been bad news bears.
This is why I watch anime and play XDU/magireco to stay sane. If I ruminated about everything that is wrong with my life right now constantly, my mind would collapse.
This is why youd never find me in china

 <@676272618839605249>
Today, I stepped back and felt a small crunch. I had stepped on the back half of some kind of caterpillar escaping the rain on the sidewalk. I thought it was dead as it reflexively retracted its body back in and stopped moving. But then after a few minutes had passed and I was certain it was dead, I saw it moving again.

Not sure if I was being cruel by not putting it out of its misery or if it would actually survive. It's a bit sickening to think about.
I remember you saying something major happened that put you on the defensive, but I didn't know it was something like that. oiyoiyoi. We got some blockheads on this server if they can't tell the difference. Take care.
I see
cp?
Aaah, that well-used Sensui reference. For a very long time, I also felt great anger for humanity that it tormented me. Sadly, I'm too kind and docile of a person to hold a grudge forever. While evils and inequality still occur, I've grown to accept that this is humanity. Living in anger over something that cannot be changed will not help anyone by any means.

My birthfather chooses not to meet me, so that cheeky comment is very good.

Gacha is an odd thing. Being able to acquire exclusive power is one of my weaknesses along with going hard at anything I try.

I don't know much about the other servers. I may have a general idea since I was the top player in Bleach Online prior. Perhaps, your way of living has not been the healthiest up to now, but I can genuinely say that I had fun with you in xdu.
Investigations? That sounds ridiculous.
I was a little surprised when you said "survived many things due to my blazing anger at life." This would describe how I used to feel, anyway. I've kind of accepted that life is unfair since then. Taking care of the health of your mother and yourself is more important. I hope that you both recover soon.

I'm not very good at comforting people, but I can give you something in exchange for your story. My health hasn't been great for a long time despite healthy living. My father's health is declining much faster. My mother was in a fluke accident involving glass, basically rendering one of her hands near useless when she is the only one in her houshold supporting everyone, including my sister in law and nephews that do very little. My brother is mentally disabled. If there is one thing I regret continuing, it is gacha. Just like you have come to realize for yourself, I've thought for a while what I can do to prepare for the coming future given our family's poor standings with health. For that reason, for a long while, I've only seen gacha as a temporary fun that will have to stop. It is only a matter of when.

<:ChrisHehehe:688429717019426821>
That opening, too.
I would watch more of it <:roopopcorn:494950223152676874>
I actually liked the angle of that one even though aspects of it were shit.
<:TsubasaFish:689163064830066696>
maybe I almost watched it

I feel like I've seen this somewhere before

~~This is me finding out Rick and Morty has a season 4 yesterday~~
~~It fisted you right in the heart~~
Which is kind of strange in itself
Fine's grand motivation was being able to talk to god
Ah yeah, that thing that went by really fast.
What were they, ruling their planet?
<:walpychan:454886290341625867>
I understand what you are saying, Lankpants. I feel pretty similarly about it. She's just the fated final boss.
That's cause Fudou is far from likeable.
<a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
Let's focus on Red Noble more <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
If I had to pick an alchemist Villain, Saint Germain was pretty strong in character.
Carol was an awful villain imo. But an exellent anti-hero. <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
My favorite might be Ver because he's really cooky and memey enough.
Just had to wait for the last season for the design to mature
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
~~fr fr~~
All you need utter is "GX" and I've already understood.
Yeah, GX
OOOOOH
Symphogear G's my favorite season. <a:VerSpin:409479566172618753>
Magical Girl Site is pretty close to my dislike, though.

I never got into Cardcaptor, but I also didn't hate it. It's just extremely vanilla.
They sinned in G, yeah
Carrying the conviction to hurt people to accomplish your goals was a hot issue.
Antagonists, but they are not evil either.
Not solid as allies
Where would we be without the stroganoff song?
its lit
yee
~~Someone who  doesn't believe in the church of G~~
huh
they mentioned the illuminati? <:WoahMiku:619781982351654923>
To me, Alchemy was just too ill defined when compared to the limits of relics and gears. Like you can do anything with it. It gets really broken when Adam shows up.
Alchemy was one of the big reasons I disliked GX. <:Ver:704169051391524875>
I see. Interesting.
alchemy?
It had great music at least
Apparently, there were a lot of people who still liked GX, but I never understood the appeal.
impossible. GX is the bottom of the universe
But it's 10/10 because we got a few frames of Miku being in her gear <:BasaBleed:576245300755431424>
fair
I was expecting Vanessa to be the only one left alive because she's frankenstein, like her upper body still crawling away, and there would be a farewell scene involving hibiki, but damn if that could have ever happened. It soounded much cooler in my head.
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
lmao
*fine
It would have been find if Noble Red died when Shemha killed them.
Hanabi would agree strongly
<a:peperun:577236228290641930> whoops
When the moderators show up <:GermainPeace:689397094666076171>
They don't stray far from their flagship
or Dead End Re;Quest (or whatever you call it)
Also wouldn't mind a Mary Skelter anime
A real Megadimension anime would be awesome
Again, very different from the source material
It got the OVA which introduced Adult Neptune
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
right. Because NIS was on boared those days
I know they used it somewhere e lse
Was that the same battle system?
It really was like a PS 2 game
What specifically bothered you?
I like old games, so I thought it was charming.
lmao
When the Re;Birth version went up on Steam, people were all over that.
I did enjoy the first one. But I played the original original game.
either that or they really liked to roleplay Plutia in hentai rp <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
The spin-off games are *still* coming
Probably has died a bit. What with their endless spin-offs and no real continuation. But they're out there somewhere.
Hopefully Re:ZERO doesn't get delayed again

Kaguya has been going great.

Tower of God pretty good.

Gleipnir continues to be weird but interesting.

I'm not as happy about Hamefura. It was the one I was most excited about at the beginning of the season, but now it's the least interesting, which is a rare occurrence for me. Hopefully, next episode will change something. The setting has a lot of potential not being tapped into.

There are things about the symphogear plot that I found to be a bit too dramatic for me. Miku being a buttmunch about keeping secrets might be one of them.
It was nice when Miku's hair was greenish.

Another thing I like about the voices is that you sometimes catch where english translations are trash.
I also like all the sound effect details.
I like hearing the emotion in the voice that goes with it. Just a preference. While I'm fine with the OG bgs, I don't like MangaGamer's eroge style sprites. The mod allows you to turn off voice volumn and switch sprite styles, but not seeing anything on backgrounds
<@!166167210350477312> Technically, I started both Umineko and Higurashi VN and never finished. It was too long ago to remember where I stopped, but I know I didn't make it that far. It's like one of those things I always wanted to do but never got around to. I went back and installed the Higurashi VN last night and then found the 07th Mod. (It's a lot cleaner sprite patch than I remember. I don't think lipsync was even a thing back then.) In short, I'm restarting the story. But I figure I can read it in the place of the time I set aside for watching anime.

Also, don't know which category this discussion falls under because it's still weeb shit. <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

This gonna be a good season

Emilia is actually still pretty immature imo.
tbh I would be a little jealous if somebody was trying to act like my friend is more special to them.

Even if she pouts about it, she doesn't show obvious signs of being in romantic love.
I don't think even Emilia understands what she feels.
Was that jealousy?
At this point, it doesn't seem like Emilia is in love with Subaru

> Shes nowhere near perfect. She even says so. The person subaru sees isnt the person she is. I really wnjoyed that convo they had when he broke basically
I like this is a point shown in the story.

Reminds me of past personal mistakes <:Sufferu:490625141932294179>
but not in game where most of the show happens
> I still don't understand why Subaru get a pass on his harem and not Kirito
<@!114081181611458563> Kirito is a walk-on-water chad. Barusu is an underdog neet.

that's probably for the best <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>

Bleach used to be very good about showing characters' motivations and backstory, especially for the antagonists. And then the final manga arc happened. They're going to have a lot of work to do turning that garbage pile into anime form.

Re:Zero S2 episode 4, fanfuckingtastic.

They are still packing content into the episodes. This one is 29.5 minutes and *still* no opening sequence.

I find a lot of people on this server who come for the magical girl first.

But I come from the angle of dark/horror that happens to overlap magical girl.

Symphogear is pretty light on the horror, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows either.

Being on either extreme of too dark or too light makes it feel unrealistic.
Magical Girl Site is a little too forced for shock appeal for me

Not that I wouldn't watch it if another season came. I watch horror even if bad.

I doubt the production team really knows that for sure, but regardless of whether it is so, their asses are covered.
Emilia and Satella sound like they have the same ||voice actor. It really makes me think there is a connection between them like Satella is a future Emilia or something. Especially when Subaru says he will save her like he did at the start of the story while dying.||
His ending would have ended the series
The author didn't even want to write Rebellion originally
lmao
https://tenor.com/view/higurashi-no-naku-koro-ni-mad-angry-rika-furude-smashing-chairs-gif-16501155
||Prior to the beginning of Rebellion, Madoka, Sayaka and Nagisa enter Homura's witch barrier from the Law of Cycles. (Although the movie doesn't explicitly say this, Nagisa is essentially an angel for Madoka.) In order to stop Kyubey's plan to observe and control the Law of Cycles, Madoka entrusted her memories and powers to both Nagisa and Sayaka so they could reawaken her to save Homura at the right time. Nagisa later explains that she took the mission because she wanted to eat cheese again.

Once she enters Homura's barrier, Nagisa disguises herself as her witch form (which Kyubey would not recognize). The other characters call her Bebe. While disguised, she stays at Mami's house and helps the magical girls fight Nightmares. The memory altering effects of the barrier causes Mami to believe that Bebe is her oldest friend. Although her own memories are unaffected, Nagisa seems to reciprocate Mami's friendship.||
Here is a passage from the wiki
||Could Madoka's powers pass through the barrier?||
Nagisa's backstory is pretty sad.
||This is why Mami is the chizu||
> I just want to mention that magia rÃ©cord has an anime exclusive character (kuroe)
> That appears for only one episode and is never mentioned again
Kuro (no e) is an ongoing joke as being a minor character in the game. Not much surprise as a result. Most expect her to die.
The original PMMM author bullies the hell out of Sayaka to the point she looks like a little bitch.

But Magireco at least gives her something. I really didn't like her before this.
The best thing to come out of Magia Record (anime) was ||Sayaka's arm||
I think they will
NA finished all of arc 1 story
They didn't even collab with Magia Record
Homura Tamera anything when

<:15min:495770478678638593>

No, aside from that

OH SHIT. I don't think I've ever seen this before
<a:qbpunch:402188922945404938>
It's easier just to hate him
If I considered their method without emotion, it totally makes sense, though.
In the case of Rebellion ||everyone was happy with the situation except Kyubey who tried to take down Godoka. That's kind of one of the ways Kyubey's a prick. Efficiency over human life.||
ah that's what gave it away
What? You don't automatically trust fluffy aliens who promise you anything you want?
||My interpretation is she's still living in despair on her own. And Also fuck kyubey.||
||It's like she's meant to die||
Even her character in the game has a death skill, which iss kind of funny
||Before she falls into despair and becomes a witch on the hospital rooftop, she does get to know homura, however||
Trying to reach into my memory
||She joins the Wing of Magius and ends up becoming the Chocolate Witch while she's outside Kamihama's barrier. I forget a lot of the specifics and I think the explanation of her circumstances are vague and open to interpretation by InuCurry's design, but she has a running theme of being a minor character. Kuroe also joins the Wings of Magius in the anime.||
Kuro is Homura's friend.

Well, even if they don't continue, it was still a pretty good ending to the animation. >>> season 1

And it's more world breaking than what they already featured??!

I would recommend Magia Record if you wanted a story that is safe from the chaos of widespread death within the Madoka universe. So far, it has no connection to Rebellion and may take place before the events of Rebellion.

Pretty close to rating it 10/10, depending on the ending.
Anyone watching Vivy? It's a pretty mature music anime about future AI singularity
<:Moona_Think:827263980459655283>
I definitely feel some of the Re:Zero author's writing in Vivy. Someone posed that To Your Eternity is better than Vivy, so these are the 3 I'm currently looking at watching.
||So many off screen deaths||
basically
Just caught up on 86. Nicenicenice
There is at least a subpopulation of people who are into this sort of thing judging from the high ratings of both shows.
I tried watching an episode of To your eternity. Reminds me a bit of the feel of mushishi. I'm kind of indifferent to that kind of aimless sort of venturing, though. I may be dropping. If the first episode is an indicator of the rest of the show, I don't think I can keep my limited attention span for 20 episodes.

Maybe I'll give that series a try based on reviews.


ngl Witch from Mercury is my first time watching Gundam since Wing, and I'm entertained. Maybe I should go back to some iron blood orphans or so one of these days. <:weirdeyes:720724151941201941>
