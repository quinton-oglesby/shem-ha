why doesn't ryoko-bot on the subreddit have Ryoko for a flair?
that's... a weird ordering system
note: i have no clue how feasable it is to move their positioning around
same for Shirabe and Kirika
the Hibiki and Miku emotes are not next to each other
i have found something of grave importance!
we'll still appreciate you for the work that you do <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>

<@!127644949884698624>
i second the petition
hmm.  could the Fire Nation take on Skynet?
and that's when Skynet takes over
maybe keep art out of fancontent and make it more for written stuff?
i now have access to <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
i don't have access to :ElfneinWeld:
though, some of those ideas might not be suitable for, umm, emotes
could go through what you have drawn to see if any of them spark ideas

hi new
we're all very expensive
there is rumors of a secret place, a place containing things far worse than nsfw.  nobody is allowed to post anything to it
we have space for sfw art, nsfw art, and general fan creations!
Indeed!

hi depressed
ok Kerrik, do your worst
i don't think it's necessary
we need a large hibiki to complement that one
we also have a tiny miku

real shame there is no team pet.
RUKIA, WE NEED SOMETHING CUTE AND ADORABLE
ah
i feel like i'm missing something for that piece
no
...
oh yeah, it's really good
that piece reminds me of Smite
but that requires slogging through the rest of it
or something like that
may i suggest a folder inside whatever folder contains the art that just holds art that has been posted here?
is there art of Miku kabedon-ing and in gear hibiki?
out of curiosity

are there any of Miku recieving Biki as a present, or vice versa?

can i request a source for that?

can i request a source for the one of the girl hugging another girl holding a teacup?
is hibiki pouting in that one?
why should you worry?  you haven't sent anything. <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>

hmm
does it become a generic harem?
i saw episode one in my anime club
and figuratively
literally
depends
there we go
wait, that's not a number...
now if it were *i*
...no, 3 is a real number
there's a number there
d^3
there are numbers
what are you talking about?
japan has no involvement in the war in Izetta
the other theaters aren't brought to focus
i believe
it essentially focuses on this fantasy country in and around switzerland
i believe WWII era tanks?
that is, multiple tanks.  at the same time
she also throws tanks around
any more of Izetta?
eh, she's fine
*Lesbians*
Lesbians
<.<

*no more*
*don't hurt me*
*Baby don't hurt me*
*What is love?*
how many gears with animal ears are there?
Izetta has a bigger gun
isn't tanya WWI?
ooh
kemono izetta?
...
my one complaint about Izetta is that it didn't seem to know what it wanted to be
I DEMAND FLUFF
FAK YOU SOLOPY
is there any more stuff like that?
i'm having difficulty recognizing Maria and Chris
Tsubasa i can see only because of the blue hair, but it's a bit hard to see that
the only ones i outright recognize (besides Hibiki front and center) is Kirika and Shirabe
we have the illuminati in the corners, but what's going on with the gear users in the middle?
while that artwork is really cool, part of it is confusing to me

*And you're to blame*
*Cut through the heart*
SAKURA TRICK AAAAAAAAAAAA
https://twitter.com/tini3030/status/859920868155170816
the lightning might be making too much noise
Tsubasa looks like she's looking down at you, and Hibiki is looking straight at you
Maria, Kirika, Shirabe, and Chris all have the same pose to them, with the only difference being the mouth size and how far up/down they are.  with their head tilted downward and a bit to their right
i wish the portraits were more different from each other
ah
and is that supposed to be Miku at the top center?
is Mio, with Dio's face, singing in Love Live in Dia's place
so what we need
<:HibikiPoint:336657004959498240>

volume 6 chapter 5 shows hints of yuzu/kaede
Sakura Trick is great, indeed.
and anime gets to halfway(?) through volume 3
up to volume 6 chapter 9 as of two days ago
ok, it is being worked on
if the manga would get translated
pretty sure the remaining two end up together
oh wait, nvm
not at all, good to know

is there art of Miku kabedon-ing Hibiki?
Hamster Jesus
Elfnein: That is a waste of a perfectly good watermelon.
*holy shit* ya'll were busy
Hibiki is definitely a puppy
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
i approve of this development
the Dashing Rogue Bikki should be just a little bit clumsy
i don't think Kirika is silent at all
also, wouldn't Shirabe more fit being cool and silent?

thanks for finding
yeah
i recall seeing a picture if the geahs out running and it was like, Miku and Tsubasa in the lead followed by Hibiki, then FIS trio and Chris in the back.
but i don't know what the name is
that character is from kemono friends
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
has there been anything of Miku kabedon-ing Hibiki?
i wouldn't mind bikki literally hitting me
i join this movement
what happened to anons No.1 - No.16389583?
and by guns i mean huge muscles
is there a picture of Mami showing off her guns?
there's nothing insane in NSFW channel
now we need the shitty art of Miku smoking surrounded
dragon miku?
wait
non parlo italiano
if anyone speaks Italian
because ~~our dictator~~ Alice said so.
but you can't  touch

yes, it's very cute
hot
no no, not cool
i thought that title was a play on the Midnight Club video games?
on the edge
i bet Leiur is driving a motorcycle
<@!102691114762371072> what's Shirabe's source range now?
i believe it takes whatever picture and puts it through sourcenao or something similar
it should happen automatically?
***LIES***
...
Chris shoots a couple rockets that explodes into miniature drone type things that shoot smaller rockets that become turrets
so
the drone type things shoot smaler rockets that explode into even smaller pieces that become turrets
i missed a step
and it's followup
here's what i was thinking of
that reminds me of a scene for Place Further than the Universe
"but we are home"
"sudden onset of the gay"?
the sora yori pointing is most likely just them being goofballs
i think that was talking about the symphogear pointing image further up
AAAH
do you think Shirabe is up to the challenge, <@431656503490117632> ?
they can be nsfw
daww
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
more than just animal ears slapped on
may i request monstrous girls in love?
we need art of Miku or Hibiki blowing raspberries into the other
is Miku blowing raspberries into Hibiki?
Miku and Shirabe (and us) really are the winners here

specifically, chapter 15
https://mangadex.org/manga/25264/the-story-of-an-onee-san-who-wants-to-keep-a-high-school-boy
apparently a hat can summon Saki
600 is a lot for a tiny miku
same vein as 12345
nah, just a patterned number
and we missed out on 13579
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
<@!246146781832806401> source for that is https://mangadex.org/manga/24121/boku-no-kanojo-wa-saikoudesu

she's thinking of Hibiki
she is
<@99695384296701952> it's apparently star wars.  http://star-wars-canon-extended.wikia.com/wiki/Guri
Latooni, that looks like something based on SC2
does the person need to be knowledgeable in the source material for checking?
the one with Kirika crying surrounded by presents is from XDU, has it been translated?

Actas was also involved, but it was primarily 3Hz
the primary studio behind Princess Principal
Deen
madhouse?
a different studio
but they haven't outright said "They're gay"
and the handholding in the last scene
i don't think 3Hz has outright stated that Ange and Charlotte are gay for each other
well
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
well, there is another section to Present that has what looks like backgrounds for phone screens and computers

i wanna ask shirabe.exe something
it just doesn't look like there's enough space between "Gay" and "And"

i believe that book Diana is reading is supposed to be "Am I Gay Or European", but i'm seeing an 'ND' under her hair after the 'GA'

what do you mean by 'isn't a harem'?
~~monster musume correctly has it~~
mal does have the harem genre tag
but mal doesn't have that listed as one of it's genres
for some reason i initially pegged it as a harem
since we're on the topic, how good is danmachi?
that was my guess, but the wiki isn't showing someone who looks like that in the character section
ok, wasn't my guess it seems

she blames Tsubasa?

Tsubasa dies at the concert
Tsubasa becomes more of a mentor figure
she becomes a gear user

finally able to feel skin again
for the first time in who knows how long
the sensation of her feet on the ground
standing on them
being able to hear, to feel, her own heartbeat
for once, in a very long time, she is alive again.  even if it's just for a moment

so far we have;
blue hair
sword
small chest
is serious
daddy issues
heir to their family
what else can we find between Lucina and Tsubasa?
there's another parallel
is Tsubasa considered the heir to her family?
Tsubasa hasn't time traveled, though...
has daddy issues
serious disposition
doesn't have a big chest size
uses a sword
blue hair
i'm gonna guess Tsubasa

bit late but DRAGONS
only to the shoulder as opposed to down the back
so the only art of DL's i found with longer hair Hibiki are of timeskip designs, and they're more like Hibiki got it trimmed every now and then.  not to the extent of the examples above
which is such a contrast from canon hibiki
i'm fairly certain the glasses there just adds to the "shy nerd" vibe that it gives off?
and i'm fairly certain DL drew something like that?
i thought i saw someone shop a frame from the show to give hibiki long hair

Tsubasa can't aim

Chris would probably flex between the sniper and... i believe they have a machine gun equivalent?

"it's what the internet was made for" is also a reference to something.
i think my bad joke missed
well, yeah.  some porn is going to suck
it's what the internet was made for
something something learn something new everyday
and that's a failure of the English language
most books want to leave you with a message, a sense that you learned something.  most games want to leave you with a feeling of wanting to go back for more.
am i wrong in thinking that it is more expensive to build a wide gaming selection than it is to build a wide reading selection?
in the same amount of time, someone growing up, more books would be read than the number of video games.
video games doesn't have the history that books have
between books and video games
there's a fundamental difference
going along with R x Ver
splinters are Rukia fetish.

parade ends and he hasn't shown up
the group he would've been with goes by and he's not there
go to the parade to watch it
i eventually think that maybe someone else showed up and gave him a ride earlier
i can see the the phone i'm calling and no one is showing up.
or to the doorbell
i show up, and there is no response to knocking on the door
so I was to go to my granddad's house to pick him up and drop him off at the parade start so he could walk in it.  after that, the rest of my family would show up, we have lunch together, and that would be it for today
so today was *fun*
that was my day today
so, yeah
30-45 minute drive took over an hour
and then traveling home, hit the "fireworks are over now" traffic

found him collapsed in the bathroom tub, glasses fogging up as soon as i enter it

if you feel it's being mismanaged, go and protest that
that's a failure of management, not in it's purpose

my answer: yes you would be missed.  i also believe one also shouldn't stay in a place they believe is not good for their mental health.
yes
ok true
so we are asked for advice, and told not to request more information about it to help make a decision
o
just to be clear, is that last one to me Kriisa?
if you want help with this, there will be sleuthing.
if something has come up that questions the existance of this server, you go to the one who made it.
this would follow for those in staff and those not in staff.
you're not sure how helpful it would be to go to Alice (the creator) about this.
so it is likely something on the staff end, or something that Alice (or someone close to Alice) is heavily invested in
is Alice not the one who made the server?
would stepping down from custodian not help?
someone cares so much about you, your opinions, your views, that they would harass you over it
not sure how well this will be received, but
trans exclusion feminists, i believe?
not to break up the conversation, but i think at this point it's out of the realm of serious discussion
`eh fuck it` literally, then.
not distracting music also helps
and don't constantly glance at the timer
rinse repeat
set a timer, study for 30 minutes, then take a 5-15 min break
and has been done for centuries, and thus has entered the forbidden to change arcane TRADITION
because it's to the (presumably) man's name
the fact that it's old fashioned is why i recommend it
would tar and feathering be too close to assault?

i believe i saw an image with the full quote
the Republicans are blocking the path to the reset button and the Democrats aren't being willing to press it
biological sex and comfortable gender are two different things
nyarlothotep never looked so cute
any rate, good luck.  i should be in bed at this point
...this is also assuming that the dude is being truthful about being in California
which isn't what you want
since "immediate emergency" has 911
which i think would be what you want
has a section for "immediate non-emergency"
https://www.chp.ca.gov/home/contact-us
could try calling them and ask if it is indeed the right place to call, and then get bounced around a lot
https://www.chp.ca.gov/notify-chp
which... doesn't seem to be what you want?
like, the closest i can find is the site for the Cali Highway Patrol
ok, the site i was at was for previous members of the state police
...probably should've suspected a .com site
unless wikipedia links to the wrong site
what you can do is submit a report to the state police and-i am not finding any way to contact them on their site
like, you at best know the county the person's in, so you submit a report to the county police that effectively says "someone who says he lives in this county is saying things along the lines of killing others and himself.  don't know who or where that person is."
welcome to the internet
unless other people can offer different ideas, without more information there's not much you can do
i recall something like this, where someone sent chat logs to the local police of the person to help them, but i believe that was with facebook chatlogs where there wasn't anonymity.
i don't think the state or county police would be willing to do this sort of thing
by local police, i do mean their local police
they'd need a warrant and go to Discord itself
that could lead down the path of that kind of track being used for not so nice things
and hope they can deal with it nicely
and could send it to their local police
have proof that it's that person
you'd have to know where he is
in the Right blue corner and the Left blue corner?

a) play Rise of the Tomb Raider
b) play Sacred Stones
c) play Battle Network
d) play Hearthstone
e) play Heroes of the Storm
~~f) do something useful in the house~~
ah
haven't played the game mode yet
you would also need to get some mana back to be able to hero power, no?
the final boss was a sorcerer, and i did enough damage in one turn to overkill him by a lot
and threw in powerattack
barbarian
i made a character that dual wielded greatswords
in a pathfinder campaign i was in recently
oh man
like when he got 3 jamming rolls in a row, breaking his shotgun
and then there are the times where the dice just hate you
and a lot of what we've been fighting has had decent AC
he has the feat that reduces to hit to increase damage
it's assuming that he hits them
but yeah, the gunslinger can definitely reach the higher dpr in the group
maybe more
and he has, like, 400 ft range ignoring less than total cover
i believe he's only getting his grit skills with his pistol
and me being the barbarian doesn't give a shit about it all
my gunslinger has three weapons; a pistol, a shotgun, and a mortar cannon
it's being a variant of fighter
either the DM did, or someone else
and one of the players is a gunslinger, using Hellsing as a token icon
i'm in a 5th ed group that's currently on hold cuz college
gunslinger, or some casting class?
ah

so for all of you that have played the gba fire emblem games
what's annoying is that there doesn't seem to be an indicator of when it activates
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
use a glass weapon 30 times before breaking
Dark Gift?  Ignis?
would running as many of the skills as you can collect be a bad idea?
and with the Astra hits, does each attack make that roll?
is it a single roll to determine if any skill activates, or does each skill get a roll and if multiple activate it goes to the heirarchy?
i know that there is a heirarchy to the activate skills
also skills in general
i have a mechanics question related to Astra
has anyone here played a lot of FE:Awakening?
which boat is that getting put down?

depends on what you're using to do the fucking

i think that group was also too big
it apparently didn't go too well
a friend of mine was in a group that did text only

because this server is the cool people server
there can never be enough dragons
do we need to roll call?

i'm fine with whatever system is used

more of a caster type
i will use the Trident of Poseidon
i know what i'm going to use
i figured we want to have separate weapon types, so if you have a good idea of what you want to do with an axe, i can go for something else

or staff
or shield
i was thinking of axe
shit, that actually really fits a thief character
did she use them outside the S1 finale?
hardest punch
harder punch

my idea is that my character somehow stole a relic without being noticed, until she accidentally activates the relic she stole to defend against a random (or not so random) Noise attack.  afterwards, she got swept up and recruited by Genjurou.
they just created a standard/wild split

bit late for me as well
oh mine isn't that fancy
or told to pick up a piece just put in
in that i was given the piece and told to put it in the center
so i would be her "mahjong monkey"
it would start to hurt to move her arms around
that's a bad way of putting it
and one of the common players didn't/doesn't have good arm control...
we would be down at a friends of the family for a party

right next to me, actually
a physical mahjong box

do i need to find the gif where he literally shoots a guy in the chest?
...
ah
you?
who sings anime songs for karaoke?
and then shoots him in the chest
he manages to take the gun away from him
i think it was a random person coming at him with a gun
it's the classic boobs/butt pose, I cannot ignore that thumbnail

no big deal if he loses there
isn't that the first match?

how much of a meme is priest otk?
wait

kk
how much is play dead?
i thought it was a 1 mana trigger all ally deathrattles?
feign death?
if you are in wild
5 of them makes a 32 damage hero power
that, plus cube shenanigans
there is a minion that double the damage of your hero power
to make Loss out of the mahjong pieces?
is it possible
maybe you should've been nicer to dog
only thing missing is eat
sleep, play games, browse the web
always
yes
stop having it be closed
open the country
i don't have a smartphone
gunboats

i might be close to the finish, are there any forced romance threads in the last bit of it?
yeah, i'm really liking it so far

and endgame is, like 110 plus grinding right now i believe
get to level 80?
you could
not normally
for stuff like that, i'll write up an extra sheet of the combinations i'd want depending on various situations
i generally plan out my characters well in advance, so i know what feats and class options i'm taking
as well as choosing where to put an extra +2 stat bonus
in pathfinder, humans get a bonus feat and one extra skill rank per level
yes
ys
this time, we all agreed to not choose a human
well, last campaign, there was no coordination on the races, and we all chose wierd races by accident.  Kitsune, Catfolk, Fetchling, Vanaras, Sylph, Aasimar, two gnome variants, Tengu.
pathfinder game i'm in just started today, and here is the character list (the DM is letting us have multiple characters, mainly for if not everyone can make it.)
Catfolk rogue and Ifrit sorcerer
Oread magus and Half-Giant cleric
Svirfneblin druid and (eventually) Suli bloodrager
Catfolk paladin and (eventually) Kitsune oracle
Kitsune rogue

HOW COULD I FORGET PLATINUM
PLATINUM
neither White nor Sky are in this thing
i've since gotten Age of Empires Mythologies, Zoo Tycoon DS, Kung Fu Panda, Golden Sun Dark Dawn, Pokemon Conquest, Mystery Dungeon Time & Darkness & Sky, Soulsilver, where is my White, Black 2, and Sun
those were my first games for the DS
Gunpey, Mario Kart DS, Balls of Fury, i don't seem to have the the CN ~~not mario~~ kart here
cuz it sits in my overnight bag
got my full DS game collection with me
age of empires i got from a scholastic fair or something
mario kart, CN ~~not mario~~ kart, and one other...
when i first got the DS
back when i only had, like, a handful of games for the DS
it was my first Mario Kart game
because i found it fun otherwise?
and he has one of the lowest drift scores in the game
mainly because my LR buttons don't work, so i couldn't use the drift mechanic
i always played Luigi on Mario Kart DS
...
aren't there a couple mechanics that do that?
ah
3 mana 6/5?
wait
when you enhance it
it changes another creature into a 1/1
so
what does Lococo do
...
around
cuz you're the best
what
wait
i feel that the first had a better story, while the second had a better pokemon selection
between Black/White and Black2/White2
for plain DS games
Platinum, Sky, Dark Dawn, Mario Kart, and Gunpey
Dark Dawn is also up there as one of my favorite
to you
it only sold one unit
get it
the problem is when you get many of them
that doesn't sound that bad
...5 mana 2/2 polymorph an enemy
i forget, does enhance # mean that it can BECOMES that cost or ADDS that cost?
what the fuck is up with that effect
choose the twintails kuudere
choose the twintails tsundere
he's supposed to be the player self insert!(?)
but
thus, this character would be better than Homura

get ten Trackings
*get ten 1 mana Coins*
*play academic espionage*
*get ten 1 mana Innervates*
unless it keeps all buffs given to it when it resummons itself?
lol
compared to say, paladin
yeah that's the thing, they have a small number of buff cards
and if they don't have an answer for the new 5/5, you can throw another thing on it and it'll stick again
7 mana 5/7 draw a card and become a 5/5 on death

it was, like, 3 people doing the song, middle person was piano, right person was bunny girl going ham on the trumpet

i'm talking about the person right under "Rhythmic Imutone"
i've noticed it in other videos, but that bunny girl with the trumpet really goes at it
mhmm
oh yes
~~except for suddenly walking forward staggering you and knocking you down which is utter bullshit~~
whereas in TERA, the enemies don't have it.  it's more like Monster Hunter, where every attack of the enemy has a tell.
meaning, if you're in melee range, you will be taking damage.  no avoiding it.
simply by the fact that Wildstar enemies have an auto attack.
i think the gameplay (when i played it, but i don't think it's changed much) is great.  i think it did the 'you can dodge the enemy' better than Wildstar did
in TERA, there's the main quest line you can do, skipping over all the other quests around you
TERA is also like that, and it's considerably younger
yeah

i also have a couple images of my graphics card going to shit, if ya'll wanna see that
how the game introduces male Castanic
not so apparent with this armor set, but it's there.
*GUNNER IS FUCKING AWESOME*
the fact that the newer classes are race AND gender-locked is a bullshit matter, but it gets excused somewhat by the fact that each race/gender combo gets their own animations for each class, so more work is required for that stuff
the male elves are nearly as ridiculous as the female elves in TERA

it's been a while since i did this kind of math so i'd like a second (or more) opinion.

the chance of either NOT happening is 39%*64.5%?   or .39 times .645

isn't it a massive crossover?

alternatively, the mode is Handholding

really like the combo you have there
10 max mana crystals
but what if you wild growth at 9 mana?
so the omega cards don't work when you coin or innervate to 10 mana
so he hadn't shadowstepped face collector
and the history has warrior hero power followed by the three face collectors
which reduces it to 1 mana, so the first cost is 1 mana followed by two 3 mana, which is 7 mana, he has 9 mana spent
he played 3 face collectors this turn, Arugal can attack
warrior cards come from being a rogue against warrior
so far, Arugal is not accounted for
yes, that's hogger, the druid legendary, and the shaman legendary
where'd mage come from?
so that clears rogue, warrior, shaman, and druid
i see mage, shaman, rogue, druid, and warrior class cards on your side

Random Fire Emblem Awakening Trivia.
Over the course of the main game, you amass an army of 27 characters (this is excluding DLC/Spotpass, all optional missions, and Lucina).
Of those 27 characters, only 7 don't have a class available to them that can wield a staff.
Lucina is the only child unit who forces herself into your army.  Only 2 of her parent options don't provide a staff wielding class.
~~but he's our boy~~
and didn't have anything special in the title?
I thought Roy's game was the first one released in the west?
so FE6
did you start with a female lord?
did it have a route split?

99% of the time, i don't use the 3d effect of my 3ds
without the 3d gimmick
it's essentially a 3ds
or if it's just one game, make sure it has lots of replay value
