You guys scared them
I’m a little late but welcome
Welcome
<:HibikiHi:336657249827028993>
Welcome
We’re talking about Waifus?
Someone loves birb
She really is an adorable dork
I love Ruby
XD
Poor glen
Whatever his name is
So she turns into that guy from the walking dead?
<:HibiMiku:336656759424942080>

I need to see some adorable cute stuff now

I NEED TO SEE SOMETHING HAPPY NOW!
I still don’t know what’s happened
I did
What happened.........
O.O
Yeah
YOU UNDERESTIMATE MY POWER!
They actually said High ground?
I know what Sama means
A majority of it is for stuff I’m working on
Sama?
Thank god i have it sorted
Over all i have 8270 pictures on my ipad in total
Yeah
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Hibiki no!
Cute!
There was that one time her arm got bitten off
That looks nice
Pirate chris!
Brilliant
I want magical girl chris
These are cool
And all those times she was called a killer
That’s what started it all
Oh yeah when she got the god powers
Yeah she’s been through a lot
Well not that much anymore
I love the series
Nani?
^
Because it’s cute
OwO
I guess that’s cute
Anime girl spongebob?
Tsubasa isn’t as flat as I remember
~~run from the dikki!~~
Run Kirika!
D-dess!
Not that again
I haven’t seen anything more perfect

Cags needs her own series
<:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711> <:Cag:423197445644615711>
I LOVE CAG
<:Cag:423197445644615711> YES!!!!!!!
Chris wanna be
She makes an amazing race queen I think
On my way home from my grandmas birthday
I don’t have my Twintail pictures at the moment though I’m on the road
I missed a Gonna be the Twintail picture dump?
Blanc and Pludia are my favourite Nep girls
Great
Lol
If you haven’t guessed it I’m a big Twintail fan
Permanent Twintails!
I think it’s amazing
Well Twintails ARE holy
Incredible!
Their still Twintails!
Blasphemy
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
Chris with out Twintails!
*plays with Shirabe’s twintails*
Ok a few
3
Make that two
I have one on my phone it seems
Lydian highschool host club?
O.o
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DESS!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DESS!
Those are cute
It all makes sense now
She’s my favourite because she’s such a meme.
Kirika is such a Meme
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DESS!
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Neko Shirabe <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
O.O
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

This getting ummmmmm quite nsfw
Basically
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
The blade and Scythe
Chris!
Oooo
*proteccs Shirabe and Kirika*
What do Yugi and Han Solo have anything to do with that?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
And Kirika’s memes are also too strong
Shirabe’s twintails are too powerful
The two of them are my absolute favourites actually

This child must be protected
Astolfo is best waifu from fate/apocrypha
Saki from Idolmasters side M and Leona from Pripara
We probably shouldn’t talk about that anymore
Edgybiki
I’m confused now
???
?
Yeah their all totally girls
Anime girls are so cute! ❤️
<:HibikiGold:370774300883419136>
Chris why you tired girlfriend?
I trust them
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Cute!
That’s rude
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
^
I’ve heard all i want about it from my friend so....yeah
My friend’s a real freak
I have a friend that’s really into this kind of thing
That video was a laugh
Sun and moon is so boring and that animation is utter garbage
But at least stuff happened in it
Ok unova was bad too
He is
Now ash is at his lowest
That was Ash’s best
You didn’t see Kalos
I watched black and white too and I’d rather watch black and white
Nah sun and moon is the worst
I gave up on the anime before sun and moon series
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Actually the anime in general is overall trash now
The dub............ugggghhh
<:MariaShock:423196877354303498>
Nobody wants to see that
They can’t even get human anatomy right now
Thought the animation was supposed to be “incredible”
^
Sure
“Incredible”
BAHAHAHAHAHA!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Chris!
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Yeah
Yeah
Wow
I have most already
I need to save some of these
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DESS!
Erina-chan!
Best Bikki
Long Hair Bikki
TWINTAIL!
Congrats <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
Pretty sure it’s shiver
DESS!
KIRIKA! DESS! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Now I’m just depressed the rest of the day thanks a lot

..................
DESS! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh
Isn’t that why edgebikki is edgebikki?
I was gonna say dead
But edgebikki’s miku is...........
I thought everything was mixed and matched
<@279341087494242304>  what are we looking at?
Nico!
We need something wholesome here too
The charm point is important
It seems


They made Miku sad
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Notenoughsunshinemiku
EdgeMiku?
Why is Kirika dead?
Looking like Fine would be great
They do
So adorable as always
Let’s rev it up!
She does
So when is Tsubasa gonna summon Stardust Dragon?
That event is today?
Symphogear 5DS?
Because their European.
Hey that works
Cagliostro is the true harem master in Symphogear.
Hey
Why not both?
I suppose
Does Cag have anyone?
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
It is an effective battle strategy though

It’s because her chest is always popping out lol
The girl
The Symphogear one
Not that one
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
Although looking like Cagliostro would be even better
Lol
It would be filled with fun misadventures and lots of <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I’d join Kirika’s pirate crew

Just looking at it makes me want to sing about ending everything.
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
I don’t know about short hair
I would be cool if she came back in canon
The season 3 events never happened in the edgebiki universe and thinking a Hibiki can help the Autoscores, Carol dumbs them on edgebiki
It does
Blind and can’t walk that’s way to sad to happen to miku
That pic is depressing
Looks like her foot is straight up gone
Another AU?
It’s most likely she’ll just be referenced though or knew the villains
Yeah
Of course
Very wholesome
It’s a nice picture


That picture
Is that from that Mickey Mouse Creepy pasta?
Wait.....she isn’t even Maria’s real Mom isn’t she
Dang
Maria’s Mom right?
Who’s that again?


Is that Erina i see in that gif?
I had too
I’m sorry XD
WHERE IS THE LAMB SAUCE!
The sauce?
Erina is so adorable!!!!!!!!
Twintail maria!
Maria can be really adorable at times


Ah
Love?
And starting a transition
I just said that because I crossdress too is all
*slowly backs away into bushes*
~~are they following me?~~
Ah
What’s it about?



<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
When Miku wants Hibiki....she WANTS HIBIKI and nothing can stop her

Kanade’s hair must be Very very fluffy
CAN she age?
Or Carol?
Adult Elf9?
I wouldn’t say Hibiki’s ripped, she has a very healthy body.
Miku getting in shape to be like Hibiki I’m guessing
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
And literally everyone no matter your preference can agree
Women are far prettier
Can’t blame them
I mean she’s got a gun pointed right at us
It’s Chris sooooo she’s assaulting
I didn’t do anything Chris!
Did the event just go up?
DESS!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Miku would probably die of a nosebleed seeing this
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Yang is the best
Chris is the best Tsun though
Tsun Tsuns of the Sympho Multiverse
Dupes happen
That latte looks really smug
Gungnir Dato???? <:GenjuurouDetermined:336656743977451520>
I want to hug her
Awwww chris.........
And now I’m hungry for fries
Fries make anyone happy
Absolutely
What happened to Maria???
Bikki as Adam?
Just like those two
And pure
So cute
What about handholding
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
DESSS!
I don’t think tying you down is gentle
Gentle femdom is the best kind
She probably could lift a guy like that
It’s too cute!
Why was that so pure!
I want to be with a cute girl like Miku too
Some.........possibly of lewd nature <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Get up to all sorts of shenanigans
I want to hang out with Cags
Me too
Probably carried over from her past body
Cags just likes the booty
Cag’s is EVERYTHING about her
Charm points are very important

Chibi cags is too cute

Shouta Aoi did amazing
Best alchemist
I ADORE HER OMG
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
Chibi Cags

This is blessed

Yes
All the things
With a determination to fist
Hibiki has too much of a chest to be a sword
I want to see Maria in Shirabe’s gear
Chris Dess!
Basically everyone uses their first gear appearance
And Maria has Black Gunginr again
Yeah
There should be an episode where Chris uses it again like a fake model version of that armour
There’s still two symphogear fics I need to work on
Shirabe is precious
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Because the artist does do Hentai
You wouldn’t be wrong
Appearance goals for XY


I’d totally grab Chris’s butt
I’ll protect the heck out of that
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
We should get back to what this channel is for lol

So wouldn’t that mean she’s in the “legally can’t say it” category
Doesn’t she have the god power now?
Maybe in bed with Hibiki <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
At all
I can’t imagine miku swearing
I think Miku should be with Fine and Elf
I’m probably in “has been known”
Especially behind the wheel
Lots of moms do
But my mom says it
Poor Shirabe is on her own
Chris swears on the regular
But I totally agree about Chris and Kanade
At least I don’t remember her doing it
I don’t think Cags swears
Time to work on “My two Shirabes”
Does Shirabe Dess?
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Thanks I guess
Miku would probably go brain dead watching that
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
How would Hibiki locate her own charm point?
*CHARM POINT LOCATED*
She sensed sunshine
There’s some zenbu in here
No bare tiddy anyway
Not that I have a problem with that
In everything else her boobs are out
Yes
The most sfw pic of Cags

What would sex 2 even be?
True
Hmmm I suppose
Why do you think Maria dropped hers
Capes are bad
Didn’t you ever see Incredibles?
Also Shirabe would be a great house wife
NO CAPES!
20?
What about 25 episodes?
Just the adventures they got up to in the 399 years prior to AXZ
That is cute
Cags always shows the jiggle
What is this blasphemy <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
That’s adorable
If it’s not nsfw it’s not cags
Scientific
Yes
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
I need more Cagliostro material
Yes please

<:Cag:423197445644615711>
Cags!
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yuri time?
But the current precure is actually for older people since it’s the 15th anniversary season
The thing is the franchise is held back from having major plot twists because it’s a little kids show
Ok good to know
Is figures and fanworks for all series?
Oh
What lines are they exactly?
But I didn’t get that from Mirai
I thought Riko was gonna turn out to be evil at the beginning when it started
OG waifu helping best Waifu
Then Ichika came around
Mana was my all time waifu
i see you people are people of culture as well
Ah
It didn’t fit at all
And in the ending episodes they randomly decided to go all edgy
It triggered my OCD
I refuse to watch the movie because I don’t like what happened to the team
I didn’t like their movie either
I didn’t really like the ending episodes myself

My all time waifu is
Kanade is wife

Let’s see my first waifu would have to be......
<:MariaConfident:336657338729627658>
True
I don’t think we should really expect much from a show about singing lesbians that fight weird jelly monsters
I see some Zenbu action too <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Chris with long hair <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I gotta go eat now
Mine kinda the same as Symphogear demographic wise
Mhm
I make my own Precure series
Not planned exactly
Tsubomi
With male fans that is
Yayoi is a major fan favourite
Yes they are
<:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ok those new event cards are...... <:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I hope this dies by the end of the week
Oh god there’s more of that girl bowser stuff here too! <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Ok........this is cute

<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Dess

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
“Hey Hibiki what happened to the villains?”
“Gone, reduced to Atoms”
Nah in XV Hibiki can now just lightly touch you and you implode
Ouch
The best show ever
Twintails you say? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Lol or that
<:ChrisShock:620077681484103680>  that was close
||This what would have happened if she struck down Fudo||
Maria cosplaying her girlfriend
Cursed <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
*happy chris noises* <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
https://twitter.com/beruka225/status/1180110680508076038?s=21
So I guess it’s good here
It’s not my own I found it on Twitter
Could a cosplay go here, cause I found an awesome Chris cosplay <:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
That’s Cag’s home
Of course
Yes
I know i made A “Is that lunch” meme
I can’t remember did i make that or someone else
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
I hope we somehow get a second Gen symphogear series
So it has to
But it’s the final season <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
I know
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We actually have scary villains again
Errrrr maybe more regression
But instead we’re getting Tsubsa development
I honestly thought they were gonna kill off Tsubsa for a minute
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Season 1 intensity
Holy shit Symphogear XV episode 2
Evil Tsubsa?
Oh no.....
It’s definitely gonna come back
What did she do?
Oh that
Even if she jumps back people won’t want to go
Her career is done it’s safe to say
After the past 4 seasons it finally got to Tsubasa
Oh and Tsubasa’s mentality on the kill count too
IN HER FIRST EPISODE
She has a higher onscreen kill count then any other symphogear villain
But yeah the new vampire chick easily gonna be hated
At all times
I’d hang out with her
And probably the most likeable villain ever
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
Cags is Cags
It’s obvious
Well
And Cags.....
Ver because he’s so entertaining
Finé because she’s Finé
Not like Fine, Ver or Cags at least
I don’t think any of the new villains are gonna be likeable
Now we’re off track
“Wholesome” <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
No hibimiku doujins must be wholesome
That’s a doujin title waiting to happen
“I have the determination to fist my girlfriend who’s now god”
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864> <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
In the good way
Fist Miku
It’s GONNA happen
Hibiki’s killing god ok
They could go through with what they faked in season 1
I hope to god it’s not Chris
Or Chris because of what she said at the beginning of the episode
I think out of anyone Tsubsa is gonna bite it
Someone is dying
I have a bad feeling
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
~~if miku lives~~
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Or maybe a series on a whole new gear team elsewhere in the world
It’s fine
They probably have all the episodes made
The vampire girl already did that
Actually she already has Infinity fists so no need
Please
Hibiki gets the infinity gauntlet
Watch it be some scooby doo type crap
And there was lots of JAM
That actually makes sense
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
........holy shit.......
“GOD DAMN IT LARRY I TOLD YOU!”
“This would be the fourth time Bill”
“Lightning doesn’t strike the same place twice”
Despite how many times that one girl says
And Anime
Modern future tech that’s why
It can’t be another brown haired girl with purple eyes
So considering how many cameos she has......
Hibiki saved her I’m pretty sure back then
No
Can we delete the concert attack as a whole from our brains
It probably is gonna be the same kid
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Oh no.......
They did Chris’ fake heel turn in shorter
Tsubsa is gonna commit Tony Stark in the final episode calling it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
“Gone reduced to atoms”
As Thanos would say
Delete this
JAM
Yeah this was more intense then season 1
And JAM
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
She’s had the stripper poll since AXZ
Welp you got what you wished for
Delete her
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
But the question is......WTF DID THEY DRAW
Too much Kiri poll dancing
Ooooook
And I hate myself for that joke now
<:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Chris: I’m fine
Entire cast: BUT WE’RE VIRGINS
Please no
<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
What’s oh god
What?
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I hate suffering
*TWO WEEKS LATER*
HOLY SHIT THEY BLEW UP LYDIAN
She faked that remember
Maria isn’t Finé
Suffering and lots of Jam
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
But sexy came first this time then suffering <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
We need sexy to make us forgot suffering
It’s symphogear
Yes
Kirika is just ALL charm point Dess
But Kirika as a whole is that
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So much Charm point in Kirika’s henshin
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
What
Huh
Or Finé possessed Shirabe
Maria
You called her sexy earlier
Kirithicc
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Kiributt
Chris, Kirika and Shirabe are my favs
Chris is my favourite too
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> She is
Kirika: <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
“Kirika why are you pole dancing.....”
Lol
She’s gotten really good at it by now
<:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>  BYE BYE LULLABY MOTHER FU$@“!?
Nah she’s the entire artillery
<:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
<:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She had the pole dancing since the start of AXZ
Oof
Don’t do linker and Geah kids
When Kiri drugged up too much
AXZ once
So....I guessing all the attendees died?
He probably dipped when it started collapsing
Lol wut
MHA?
Can it just be all Fine’ English
And then a unneeded dub <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
WOW
I’ll have to see

Fudou to Tsubasa: Yes....i can feel your anger use it.......STRIKE ME DOWN WITH IT!
Not long considering that American base was destroyed

Gone reduced to atoms
Oof
Hibiki: Don’t worry everyone will be Fee-nay.

Hibiki: What?
Chris: Nothing

I just looked at Chris’ transformation again. Did she load guns with her boobs? <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Minus having to fist everything to save the world
Hibiki is goals
Miku: Daddy...

Tsubsa playing Fruit ninja
Kiri WOULD have a YouTube channel
Emotes too much
But I’d watch Kiri play it on YouTube
I just hate it because it’s popular
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ewww Kiri plays fortnite <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

I hate Fudou 3000
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
It’s real life
.......I’m sorry I forgot Symphogear isn’t anime
Hibiki is clearly the strongest anime character ever
He’s watched way too many action movies to lose
<:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Next episode by the time everyone gets to the sub i bet the guards will be beaten up
He probably has a plan
I didn’t see that coming though I guess what’s his name is pinning everything on S.O.N.G
Yeah but he surrendered pretty quickly this time
Or he’s just being <:GenjuurouThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Well he didn’t put his hands up when the government guys showed up
So did Genjiro turn on them too?
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> or Genoside by Piano
Piano death machine
Besides infinitely producing coffee
Yeah the coffee lady is the most normal
The school friends aren’t normal either
But no one in symphogear is really normal
.......not by much
Gen is probably the only normal one
The Kazanari family is all kinds of messsed up
Wtf
Who is also Tsubasa’s Grandpa Dad
You thought it was Fudo but it was I Fine!
From the zwei wing concert to now
From the very beginning
Fudo was probably behind everything
Just to have him around as a meme
Maybe
He is inevitable
We can have only 1 Doctor Ver! <:Ver:336656981144109066>
That would be funny
Oh people think Millarc killed him instead?
The inspector guy just doesn’t have Ver’s charm
Looks like we have a new Doctor Ver to but.......
Wtf that ending!!!
She’s definitely part American <:ChrisEating:384879395829186560>
Except food and guns
I don’t think she’s really shown interest in anyone
Except Chris
All the geahs is Gay

As long as Miku didn’t just die
<:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
Hibiki will go have her wonderful lesbian life if Miku
SYMPHOGEAR CINEMATIC UNIVERSE
We’ll just enter a new phase for Symphogear and get introduced to the SCU
Then we build a new Death Star moon base for S.O.N.G
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
But we need the moon!<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Let’s go back to original Ledyian
“We switching sides early”
It’s most likely gonna be clones of the season 3 autoscores
Looks like
And the inspection was a fake from the start
Remember that was all a trick
No amalgam isn’t illegal
MORE SMUG CHRIS
Fudo: You will always be a sword.....

Tsubasa: No....i am a wing *snaps wearing the gauntlet thing*
I’m just waiting for Tsubasa to reverse uno card Fudo
Hibiki just needs to fist miku
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Miku gets the infinity whip
Well they are weak
~~Tsubasa~~
I’m still 100% sure someone in the main cast is dying
It’s going to end happy
Elf in Carol’s Faust Robe <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
~~Miku is Fine’~~
Oof
For the Autoscores still inside I think
And not the good kind of fisting
If Miku was hurt Noble Red would probably die by fisting
Where did Gen find him
Yep
DEIJA VU
Symphogear is one big good turn
I think it’s the same from the Prelati chase
We’ve known Maria is a human Jigglypuff for years
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
I can’t believe we’re heading into the endgame of the season already
“This is our ultimate target, THE CHARM POINT”

Cags would know everything a guy likes
Exactly
“And these are my reasons why Cagliostro is best girl”

Wait are they bringing that back?
I don’t see them doing what season 4 did over again
Maybe
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
“I’m gonna have this be my proposal ring!”
Obviously didn’t know enough


It’s a card from XDU


I don’t think the universe could handle that much Biki

But just doesn’t seem in character
I’ve seen the fan art too it’s nice
Carol: Yo where’s the rent for using my giant evil Piano house
I don’t really see Hibiki having long hair as an adult
Yes please next Gen season and a movie to lead up to it
Dude when Symphogear is a decade old we better get a movie or something

Chris’s chest is the final boss
Her boobs have gained sentience
Her Zenbu’s are useful airbags

Enki is the real last action hero
Shemha: Boys don’t know about MY beef stroganoff. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>

Now Millarc is just a little bat

“And then actually fisted me”

“She fisted a alien god out of me dear”
“Mommy tell me how daddy saved the world.”

Nope
This is new
I’m liking her, so sure
Pizza sama?
I like the girl with the twintails
I’ve never watched it either
I don’t really understand what exactly is going on in GuP but I guess I’ll continue it.
Well first episode was interesting? I guess
I see
Oh ok
Wouldn’t they get hurt in those tanks?
I’m gonna check it out now
That’s funny
XD
Ok
I might have to watch this show now
Nice
English right?
Oh i like the look of her too
XD
Kinda a weird name but ok
What’s her name again?
Wow
Mostly because I’m worried what if after I change my mind
You’re pretty brave Alice I don’t have the courage to get changes done
I get it too
Just thought like throwing that out there too.
My body is male though
Yes yes we are
I’ve never experienced neither or both though
There

Let’s see if i can find something that can explain it.
Thanks
I’m gender fluid.
I guess I’ll share something about me then.
I had an adopted sister i kind of liked
Canada is nice
<@!127644949884698624>  I’ve thought about it a bit mostly because i perfer being female more
But more when i was younger
Sometimes
Good job
Chibi Chris is a precious thing that must be protected
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
Chris is a great thing to think about
That always helps
Just think of Chris
Tell them that
^
Yeah explain the situation to them
I hate when they say that too
You can plan but sometimes shit happens
I honestly hate when a teacher/professor says “plan better” especially with something involving computers
How can you plan for random occurrences?
Dang...........
I know from experience too
Unity is not user friendly
Sorry for rambling
And the place is really religious
EVERY man has worked at the factory or on the base etc etc
It’s one of those little tiny ass towns with a majority that hasn’t moved on from the 50’s
I’m just really scared because of where I live
But yeah I shouldn’t
I settle for good enough in a lot of stuff it seems
But doing what I am doing right now does make me happy enough
At the moment I just crossdress and such and use female body care products
Because I prefer doing feminine things way more then male things but at the same time the impact making the choice to change to a female would make really scares me
I don’t know......
There’s days where I’m 100% certain I want to go for it and make the change but then the next I’m afraid to
I feel like I’m in that boat
Oh ok
Sorry if I’m getting it completely wrong
Like they don’t want to admit they are trans?
😅
I’m not sure
Or should we.....change it
Anyway let’s get back on topic
~~in USUM I have the full lurantis clothes set~~
I pick the girl option kinda because of both she’s much better to look at and because I’m like Alice
Why should they care what avatar you use
Dang
All communities do
What game is that?
Also no one explained what pot of greed does
I’m sad by the severe lack of exodia
The woman in town like me at least
I guess that’s true
And it shouldn’t be too hard since i dress like a girl already
That’s true
Well I guess considering my self as Trans girl is the start of it
Hmm
I still not sure if i can consider myself that though since I haven’t started the process
It’s good to see more though I’m starting to feel a bit more comfortable
......that’s the appropriate word right?
Wow there’s a lot of Trans female people here.
Interesting
It’s weird especially in my family
And I don’t have any typical masculine things anyway besides well you know
I’m 20 so probably not much will change
What do they do exactly.....
I might start with the hormones I guess
Yeah
Wow
I feel much happier
Loads
Yes
What’s that?
Yes
If that’s what it is
The operation that is
Maybe I should go for it
I want to keep my feminine look
But i also don’t want muscles
So it’s good for health
The lawn mowing keeps in good shape I guess
If you get what i mean?
I just don’t want anything to do with those jobs
Yes there’s women in the military and they do physical work too but that’s not the point
Who doesn’t like doing typically male things period
Then theirs me
And his dad’s dad etc etc
And his dad did the same in England
Volunteers at places, works on the military base etc etc
He’s always doing something around town
But he enjoys working period
He enjoys it
This is just the first time I’ve decided to vent about it
I’ve mowed lawns with him a lot this isn’t new
Having 20 more dollars cause I’m broke
Experience?
But he really wanted me to help and I’d get 20 dollars out of it so......
I’m of age where i can say I don’t want to do it yes
At least I wasn’t wearing anything nice
I still did it though since I’m their only kid
He never understands I don’t like to do typical male things
I don’t like icky
Today sucked.......had to mow a neighbors lawn with my dad..........so icky
Anywho.....
Lol yeah
Thanks
Mind if i vent here at the moment?
He looks like the new Spider-Man
I try look cute everyday
I too like cuteness
I cry over one song quite a bit too
If she cry’s I’ll probably cry too
I do get very emotional when my moms upset though
I’m pretty normal for crying I think
It did
That gif didn’t work
Doesn’t really intimidate me
Can’t stand pickles
Then I’ll eat salt and vinegar rice cakes instead of pickles
Is that a metaphor or actual pickles?
Pickles?
Ouch
Is it bad the first thing I want to do when my breasts would form is to play with them?
I’m dying over here now
Alice you made my day with that..... “titty skittles”
XD
Oh Well I think we’re friends
Oh lol
How are we not best friends Alice
(Autism)
But I get health stuff double free because I’m counted as disabled
~~technically it’s not free we pay it through taxes but that’s besides the point~~
But would this be health care?
Yes
Health care is free
Ontario
Canada
For my case
That will still be kinda big
I gotta write all this down so I know what to expect
(Had to sorry)
Thiccness
*hoping that will be the case for me*
That’s good
Yeah it seems so, hope I don’t have to deal with it but seems likely
Wow 17 minutes is impressive
I’ve never played ocarina so I wouldn’t know all that well
I’m guessing speed running that game is impressive?
Who’s Narcissa?
Bye bye see you later
Was probably pills for my autism now that I think about it
I remember when my mom gave me  flint stones gummies and they looked like that
Nah my mom couldn’t have
They......look familiar
So that’s what the pills look like?
I already bruise easy no problem
Oh
That’s good
Just another thing i need to worry about if i go through with it too it seems
Hope you’ll be ok
Dang
🤔
Wait you did weed?
I’ve already landed a job too
And I’m getting into voice acting now actually
I’ve already voice trained myself
Oh god vocal surgery would be nightmarish
Vocal surgery?
I’m sure there were a lot of people in history that were
But I can’t sing
I’d LOVE to be a gear user
Because singing lesbians
Lol “puts in hat”
Then sleep ibu
Yeah order out especially if you’re high
Get a sandwich or something maybe?
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Farewell for now ibu
And we are so amazing
We humans are weird
Idol Masters side M
I don’t know it’s weird
Same style sense too
Probably not the case
I’m almost convinced they made Saki based on me but
Thanks
Etc
Same eye colour
Same hair
Obviously I’m not anime but i think you get my point
I’m basically the IRL version of this character it’s insane how similar i look
Ah
You guys know Saki Mizushima right?
I don’t really use socks i prefer leggings myself
I look for the cutest stuff
That’s terrifying
Duh
I wouldn’t do it because you might accidentally start the operation too early
I definitely wouldn’t risk that
I’ve just miraculously haven’t gotten any yet
20
I dread the day i start getting body hair
I feel the same
They didn’t even make it to ultrasound stage
Way after i was born
So it’s not them
This was after i was born
I would have had siblings to but they didn’t make it either
And it’s labeled same year was due
I’m the only child
It’s me
It’s what started my crossdressing probably i think
I guess it was really good if i won
My costume was just the girls school uniform
One highlight in my life i like to share is when i won best costume for Halloween in highschool one year
Might be fun
I think I’ll definitely share more stories of my life here
Have fun reading my autobiography lol
I’m just rambling now
Huh........
Although I don’t like Dikki pictures
Since this is a Symphogear server I thought dikki would be funnier
She just has a dikki
Hey maybe they did get that daughter after all
But now I’m thinking
Ooops
Heck they had girl shit all bought and everything
But since every other first born from my moms side was a girl they figured it would be a trend
I was always turned around when ever they’d do an ultrasound so they couldn’t ever see what i was
But my parents assumed i was a girl before i was born
I was a mystery baby until i was born
It must have been me
So
And I’m the only kid
Cause i found an ultra sound tape which i know is me but it’s labeled “our daughter Victoria”
I didn’t even have to ask
I’d give it a lot of thinking
I’m ok with either guy or girl pronouns myself
I don’t get mad about someone getting it wrong
Me too
That’s good
Fair enough
So she’s into that kinda thing?
That’s a good message
Dang
I wish i had one
Ah
Who?
Good luck
I’ve got a whole folder of Saki
Saki’s in their game more
But Saki’s barely in it
100%
So yeah I’m sure
And the fact my parents told me after i found it yes that’s my ultrasound
Gotcha
I mean intellectual
This is basically the smart person channel
The more you know
Keeps your bones healthy etc
Milk is good for you
Dang
You’re going camping?
And this was in the sixth grade

This Anna
Think Anna
Girl in my class had the serious hots for me
I mostly avoided events like parties and sleepovers for a while since i was almost assaulted during a school trip to a camp
Maybe younger
I haven’t been to a party since i was like 12
Party
🎊
I was doing a lawn mowing job with him and he started acting like a total ass
I’ve had it with him
I am not working with my father anymore
Ahhh feels so nice after a bath
I’ve seen worse acronym mistakes
So I guess it’s fine
Hey you didn’t mean any hate
There you go
Canada Kawaii Queen
I might get some super fancy clothes too
Mine are too but that’s why i love it
Hair, nails, skin etc
I’m getting everything done tomorrow
My mom is very good friends with a woman’s clothing and beauty shop owner in town and she gets in for free and i do too after i begged
I’m getting some pampering done tomorrow that’s for sure
I will
I still can’t believe that
I made it
Yeah
She’s absolutely appalled with my father
I told her why
Yep
So had to detour to my moms work to get hers
Forgot my key back with my father
Just had to do  a little side quest
Yeah
But still sucks
At least they weren’t that good of clothes
I’m bathing for an hour when I get back home
The new cute clothes I bought are sweaty and yucky now and I smell from the sweat this isn’t cute at all!
It’s hot as shit
This sucks
Really
I’m fine
I’m not too too lost
No but I have i good sense of where I am
Fuck my life
And now I’m lost
I live with my parents
And yes I do have in contact with him
I’m in Canada Saki
Thanks
To the other end of town
I’m now stuck walking home
Meh
I then walked out
He called me a disgraceful disgusting Fa word
The lawn was fine we started fighting then his true feels about me came out
Oh I guess that explains it
He’s actually saying that about his mom???
What?
I just did now
Perhaps
Canada Kawaii Queen right here
Hell I will be one now
I look like a pretty hot chick. <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Counterpoint: Me
Not likely since she’s an anime character but a girl can dream
Hope I’ll look good like Maria
Thanks
I prefer it actually
No i want to be called a girl
From people who didn’t know
I’ve been called a girl a lot already
But I shouldn’t have trouble
I’m gonna have to get used to that
Thank you
😁
I am
Just now
Honestly this is probably the push I needed
Yeah!
“Titty skittles” time
I might go ahead with it
And after tonight
And I’m on disability so......they’d pay for the operation anyway i think
Well i am in Canada so I don’t really have to pay for health things
And that other thing
I know
Although there are organs i want to swap out
Not that either
Hell no
But i need a way to get money
Never doing lawns again
I just did
Yes
After that fuck no
He’s yelling at me to go with him to do another job
(Here: home)
Aaaaand he’s here now
Amen!
And getting tits isn’t the important thing
Hell yeah
A gal can dream
Just as long as I won’t need Fine style shock therapy
No matter what I’m sure I’ll be satisfied
Or Zenbu’s if I’m lucky
I’ll have Bikki’s at least
Alice says I’d have 2 sizes lower then the average female in my family, in mine that’s still stacked
If I find one
That’s one thing I’m looking forward to
Heck yeah
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
But hey faster the better
I’m surprised too
But I’ll keep that in mind
I haven’t been given anything yet
Snuck off
Difficult doing it in secret that’s for sure
I’m in the starting phase of HRT
Cool
I checked it out just now it happened in a video game (I think?) and in a comic book too
TO THE INTERNET!!!!
I don’t remember Timmy becoming Timmantha more then once
I only remember the one
There are????
I love that one
Oh my god the timmantha episode
I honestly liked Poof
For now
At least I’m going somewhere I like with my parents
Good thing it’s walking distance
Well i got subway
It is
Ehhhhhhh maybe I’ll go out and get something
Only thing i know i can order out
Screw it I’m ordering pizza
I don’t think we got that around here
Their not that good there
No
I had a pizza for lunch so.........
I don’t know what to do
I’m getting delivery
I’m on my own for the night
I need an idea for dinner
Things get better
Either way my voice is pretty feminine but still
(A male voice)
And unfortunately that’s when my voice went to how it normally is
I told them off but of course they didn’t take me seriously at first
I bunch of teenagers harassed my mom and I jumped in to defend my mom
And I think I got my dads respect back
I’m back
Huh
Welp gotta go now
So that’s nice
She likes going to do girls night things with me
No way
But there’s no malice
With my mom it’s ignorance
But she doesn’t get it at all
My mom is somewhat ok with it
Really oof
Especially since we’re a religious family
It’s gonna be a rough ride
Never have been got at that
Idk I can’t really explain it all too good either
Just had a guy shell
I was always really Victoria and a woman
I guess they don’t really understand it
I’ll always like what I like
I mean I’m still the same person
It was kinda rude that my parents asked if I still liked racing
It’s pretty big in Canada too
Yes I am
We’re heading to a military appreciation event at the race car track tonight
And used my crappy hair extensions
I was wearing some stuff I didn’t care about
Oh well
Yuck......
We got covered in dust though
He said sorry about the Fa word too
Either way my dad was impressed
Guess I need to voice train more
No more faking it with socks
But getting the chance of having boobs is exciting me
I didn’t really plan on naming them
I don’t know
What are?
I’ll have to see
I don’t know
If they get to zenbu size
Possibly
That only happens in anime
That’d be crazy
But yeah i know I shouldn’t expect boobs right way
Considering i get those already
So I’ll look out for that
I heard they can strengthen migraines though
I guess it takes time to kick in or something
I feel pretty normal for me
And i had my first of the pills today too
Yeah
I’m not anymore
They were even more rude then my dad
But then again I guess they weren’t really if they aren’t happy that I’m making myself happy
Well i lost a friend today
Interesting
What’s up everyone?
Elsewhere
Or it’s from the walk i did today
Think the pains are starting to kick in
Sup everyone
Yeah.....
Yeah
I don’t even want to repeat the gross stuff he said while i left
Yeah
And sick too
They were pretty rude
Yeah
Rip
Ah
Mock test?
I’m hoping to make my own series one day
Nice
Especially since that’s what I want to do too
Yeah I’m curious
I know that feeling
Went around a mall for a bit
A while
Not sure
So probably walked a bit too much
Legs mostly
A bit
After saying something like that you gonna show it
Let’s see it
Thanks latooni yes we are cute!
Or I guess my current name is enough
Should i use either of those?
Anyway enough of my misadventures
How else would she enter that position no problem
I wouldn’t be surprised if the bitch was possessed
I did my research after I graduated and apparently it was built on an old insane asylum and that “factory” next to the school was what was left
Omfg it was sketchy
And the location of the school too
But it was for justice
Only time I misbehaved at a school
The memories though I actually made a KnD team there to fight her
Thank god I was only there for a year
She was disgusting
So she probably got in trouble for the child fighting ring thing
She was canned after the year I finished
That apparently her sister was in
One of my friends ended up in her office one day and told me she flipped her shit when he sat in a specific chair
The lady not only didn’t like different people I’m pretty sure she was also insane
At least I had a lot of adventure at that school
Thank god I didn’t find out I was autistic until later
No clue
Man it was some KnD type shit at that school
Night
I basically busted a child abusing ring I think
I don’t think anyone would have
I wouldn’t have even know if I didn’t get curious one day during recess
I’m not gonna say what she did to them it was awful
And the principal was the worst with kids with disabilities
That school was so awful
I was so happy when I graduated from that shit show
And the principal condoned it!
And he got bullied out
We had one kid of colour in the whole building
I remember what happened and my elementary school here in my 8th year
My town really has a problem with people when they aren’t “normal” even though there is no such thing
I don’t really have any close friends irl anymore
The town I live in has basically stayed in the 40’s and 50’s
I know that feeling
I’m guessing you live in a tightly knit community?
Dads always seem to be the problem in this type of thing
Something tells me from my dads reaction from before his family isn’t gonna like it
Going back to where I lived as a kid for Father’s Day
I’m about to see what the rest of my family thinks of my transition this weekend unfortunately
I want to get frilly underwear eventually
Those are buried among my other books
Although I have a few mangas of to love ru
What pictures i do post here immediately delete from my saved photos so it has no trace
I don’t have any of that
My parents don’t get to touch anything in my room
There’s an anime character I really love too
I know that feeling
Doesn’t anyone remember “let’s sleep together Kirika?” “DESSSSSSS”
They probably have
No sunshine????? 😧
You weren’t corrupted
Should we have a drunk channel?
<@!175163984197058560>  Welcome to Alice’s symphogear army
The doctor let me because I told him I’ve been crossdressing for years
I started the HRT almost immediately
I don’t want to stop anyway so 👍
I was gonna say I missed something when the doctor was explaining things
Now that I’ve started HRT I have to take it forever now?
Wait that’s actually a thing?
I’m part of a Harem????? 😯
Thanks
I’m gonna have the plesent time of coming out to my grandparents today myself
I haven’t changed mine legally yet
I changed my name to what it would have been if I was born a girl
Headpat
The gayness drew me into symphogear
Symphogear is just that special case
This is my thing

Pretty and pink baby
Not like that edgy Site one that’s out
The super sparkly kind
I just love that magical girl stuff
YES
^
It wasn’t symphogear though it was Precure
As for how I realized I was trans it was also because of magical girl stuff
Those damn frilly panties
I connect with her
Cags is probably my all time favourite symphogear character
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
Cags became a very fabulous woman
^
But in symphogear universe they were a woman the whole time
I know the other two are but I’m not sure about Saint-germain
TO THE INTERNET
Well I guess i just wait and see
They might not accept it.........
And my dads parents are probably going to be accepting because their so old they probably won’t care
My moms dad will probably be accepting too because if he doesn’t agree with my grandma there’s hell to pay
So I think it’s a 👍 from her
And she loved my style
My mom’s mom thought I look adorable
I’ve yet to see what my dads parents think
Took me defending my mom from some people to pretty much restore things with my dad
But he came around after last weekend
They don’t exactly understand it but my dad gave the most trouble at first
My parents are somewhat accepting
It would have been weird
One of my cousins is named Hana so
Hana wouldn’t have been a option for me
It is
👍 👍
Not my cup of tea but hey DL you do you
Ah
What does DL draw?
Lingering
Lingerie
Frilly panties
Or you could lingerieing since yesterday
Eeeeee
True!
😊
But continue to call me cute
Latooni stop you’re making me blush
Exactly
We aren’t as confident as we look at all
I have to agree
I kinda want ramen too now
We must get Ramen for Alice everyone
Yum
Gay is pretty much the norm
People shouldn’t even fight it here
Gay is the specialty of Symphogear in general
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
This place is for venting after all
O.O
Meanwhile I’m here on the sidelines
Yippee
Time to see what my dads parents think
What’s Terf?
Oh
I just don’t keep up with the situation in America is all
I’m so lost right now
It can be so confusing
Me too
To the internet!
I still want to get with a girl
How did I come out here???? I don’t particularly remember I think it slipped out lol
Sure Alyx
Alice as a proper trans army gathered
I don’t want to be with a guy though
I’ve thought about being a mom but I’m not sure
Awwwwwwwww
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I don’t know what I want to do
I have no idea about the political stuff
Fair enough
And they had questions
My dads parents
They’re too old to really care but they said go for it
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456> 🌞
Wish me luck
Anyway I gotta go now at my dads parents now
Me?
Ok
It was probably that
It was around AXZ cause Elfnein was there
No
I’m not sure
Maybe something to do with her
Not really but Finé was there
Maybe from XDU
Think it was oc
It was as if it was a proper episode
Not the whole thing
It was especially fun getting to see...... two things up close. <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
Ok
Should i take talking about this dream elsewhere?
It was so weird seeing things from Chris’s perspective
I’ll have to see it
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
ZENBU ZENBU ZENBU AND ZENBUS
I think I listened to makyuu ichii-bal too much yesterday
<:ChrisSmile:336656717553074176>
I was Chris in my dream last night
Good morning
Parents are dragging me down with them for a day in the US
Uggggghhhh I’m really mad
Lol
The person was probably just being an ass
Not sure about that myself
And honestly i think they just wanted to cause a sink
Person we got going to the states was picky
They let us go but said to get my documents/etc changed
It was difficult
Meh.....
I’m back
Just really concerned
I don’t know
I’m not going though an airport just a border while driving
What
So i have to wear my boy shit again
Or anything for that matter
Especially since I haven’t got my passport changed
I don’t even want to go
It’s just so random
I don’t know why
I can already tell
This can go so badly
That sounds like a really bad idea
Ah
I didn’t
No
I think
And I’m not possessed
I can still see
Especially since we’ve all masterbated and nothing happened
Religion honestly feels like it’s not needed anymore
Let’s see this cute jacket
OwO
At least it’s better then what you thought?
Also that’s weird Saki
Religions say their all about world peace but they’ve started so many wars it’s insane
I don’t really like organized religion anymore
But I don’t 100% believe all of it anymore
It has some good stories
I like it
Anyway my two cents on the bible
Right
Good
Oh I’d study the hell out of it <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
That’s a religion i want to study
And by Christian i mean we praise Chris’s Zenbus
We are a good Christian Symphogear server
Well I’m not surprised
I see we were talking about the bible
😦
I’m Gonna be the Twintails too
But hey Retconing is a thing
And season 2
I wouldn’t be surprised if Bikki actually did have a Dikki
That’d be weird
Well not her actual Dikki
I’ve become Bikki Dikki
<:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
And yet I don’t like Futa go figure
I’m gonna become a Futa
Yeah
Lol
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Actually.........I’m just gave myself a feel and i feel a bit of titty
But for the time being I’m flat as a sword

This is more what i was going for

Not exactly 😐
THEY CAN NOT BE CONTAINED
I refuse to calm them too
<:MikuGay:336656810788388864>
I’d want to become Cag
My parents work all day so i just got on a bus to go to the next town over to do HRT
Lewd
Have fun!
Neat
What for?
Wait you want a gun?
KRISS VECTOR
That sounds like a Symphogear Attack
I’ll probably do that too later
I’m never turning back
I’m probably gonna adopt
You don’t?
THE END
Twintails are life
Twintails are love
They give me a tail gear and i run off the save the world with them
I’m so happy
It’s the twintails
I lay there crying until i feel a soft touch on my back like an angel’s wing
He slaps me and i go to my room
I also called him stupid
My dad called me stupid but i know he was jealous of my devotion to twintails
Twintails are life
Twintails are love i say
Thanking her for the twintails that have been given around the world
I pray to tailred every night before bed
And episodes
I had all the merchandise
I was only 16 years old i loved twintails so much
I have it
I did
Yeah
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I just gotta channel my inner Bikki
Yeah
Well my foot is sprained
Ah
Ok?
But nothing is seriously broken
Well still hurts
I’m fine
Ok update time
Yeah their gonna take me
But once my dad’s home they’ll take me anyway
She was a field medic so she should know what she’s doing
She checked it out a said I should be ok
Thank god my mom is home now
No
I’ll have to call an ambulance then
I think I broke my right foot
No
I fell down the stairs......
Pushing a lawn mower
I get my workouts from doing lawn care
Just gotta build it up
Yeah
They always have to find a way to blame video games
Yeah she’s wrong
That was really terrible of her
Hugs!
He/him
No i do want to be called that or Ryan that was my original name anyway
Thanks everyone
I wasn’t ready to change that fast
Sorry...... 😢
I think I rushed in too quickly
I was starting to get terrified of it
Yeah
I’ve given up on HRT
Taking a break
20
Rock meet bottom
This is feels like the lowest I’ve ever been
I hope
They think I can’t care for myself because I can’t make decisions properly
Mhm
I am autistic but I do not need a helper
It’s an autistic helper
And it’s not the good kind of helper like a therapist
That’s why their mad
And are thinking of getting me helper
Now my parents think I can’t decide for myself
I just feel like complete shit now
Not anyone here elsewhere
Backlash I’m getting
And getting hurt earlier in the week didn’t exactly help
It was starting to scare me
But yeah I decided I’m not ready to transition I’m officially starting to get off HRT today
Not sure if you saw what happened last night
I feel like crap
And I’m gonna continue dressing in girl things regardless sometimes too
I may have decided to stop HRT for now but it doesn’t mean I’m gonna stop trying to be the most kawaii thing in Canada. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So today got a bit better
I did
Ok
Well i did go out for today
Not really
Thanks
What on earth?
Before attempting HRT again I’m gonna make sure I’m absolutely 100% sure and ready
The cutest in town
I want to be a guy right now
True
Wow that’s seriously rude of them
For Kriisa
headpat
I love safety dess
^
Mhm
Estrogen is the answer to every problem
Eeeee rip
Hope that guy’s family and friends can over come what happened
I heard
All idk
That might be the future
And after my mom was so supportive
After i said I didn’t want to continue HRT mine said “so are you gonna dress normally now”
Honestly I know what you mean
Much more comfortable
I absolutely adore skirts
How is everyone?
We’re almost in the poor house because of the amount of gas we’ve had to get for these trips
But my parents are at fault too because they’re going through with it.
We can’t just hop down every time something happens
I don’t think they remember we don’t live in the same town anymore
But the grandparents just don’t get it
And we live a long way away from all that’s happening
The grandparents are starting to kick it all at the same time and my aunt and uncle’s (on my mom’s side) 10 years on going divorce is at a fever pitch.
Unfortunately it took longer then it should have because of all the driving around we’ve had to do this past month and we’re still having family issues
They have been for a good two weeks at least now
My leg and back are all better now.
Yeah.
Family emergencies all at the same time and crap
Reason why I haven’t been here like..........at all recently
A lot has been going on with me
How’s things going for everyone?
I agree with Alice you can’t exactly describe it
I’d still walk out
Actually I’d just grab it and shoot Myself with it save her the trouble

Can i just blasted with this already?
I’m not sure how to really explain it
I just felt happier
But I shouldn’t start again unless I’m absolutely ready
I might just start HRT again at least when i was taking the pills i was more happy.
No
My mom just had a break down because these visits every week have driven us into the poor house
They’ve cried wolf so many times now my parents are getting them booked in a home
Welp the grandparents have wasted our time and money for the last time
I much prefer being feminine
Same
?
Zenbu tiddies quest
Yep
Yeah i did but I’ll probably start when I’m ready again
Hm?
Headpats
Ooo headpats
Hi
*floats in*
This is a private section it’s fine

Same for me ^
Carol too
The precious little homunculus
Elf9 deserves all the headpats
Rip
<:ShirabePout:336656831978012712> what’s up everyone
Thanks, don’t know why my mom thought quitting her job and doing a home daycare was a good idea........
Being sick sucked.....dang kids.
You’re asking the worst person to ask for advice
Huh?
Thanks everyone
Thanks

I’m starting to get breasts now
Why did that whole argument in the video remind me of Woody and Buzz arguing XD
*starts eating popcorn as the argument in the video starts*
What are they exactly then?
I was thinking of thinking of tariffs 😅
If that’s the case I’m thinking of something else
A tax right?
What are terfs again <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>

I think I’ll skip this game

I’m best girl
No no no
Oh I can’t get pro
But what program do you use anyway
<@269526749249929227>  I’d duel if I was at home
