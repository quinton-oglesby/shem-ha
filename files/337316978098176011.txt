Chovy goes first
Actually
First, let me get my ship out of the way
It's teadition
I'll have a pint ready
Come over to England
```I love living in New York, but I hate living in America. Can we just move the entire city to France or something```
France is terrible
Which is a real thing
And thus, we run into the issue of 'people who can't seperate reality from media'
*Most* of the time
It's just another form of attracting attention to a story, like adding a popular thing like Isekai's
99% of the time it's just fetish bait, but I don't see it as encouraging people to do the same
Yeah, really projecting there
Projecting just a little there R
*Shrug*
It's a very complicated subject honestly.
I'm not disgusted, but I do worry about the implications of grooming.
Also, please actually converse rather than prod R
That's a consequence of the majority of characters being underage
Which puts an entirely different spin on this
That's implying underage sex
That's how pretty much any other close friendhip works when one friend tries to take it further and you are hesitant
Not sure it works that way Alice
It's a difficult subject because of the implications of grooming
Not really, grooming is very different to 'growing up with them'
But if two family members actually love each other then so long as they don't have children, I really don't see the issue
Never really got the who disgut towards Incest.
I mean, I understand *why* it is illegal, genetics/grooming and the like.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pRkS08Bxvr4
Also
It's magical
https://youtu.be/G93bj1HARA4
Kind of a thing
It's just
We take the piss out of the French and they do it back
A thing
Umm
It's not so much a meme as a...
Finland?
Oh, you mean Eastern Sweden?
```English person shittalking France... hmm...```
We have the right to diss the French as do they back.
Anyone else can get fucked.
Also, super fast internet
Here is your complimentary AK47 and Disentry
Welcome to Yugoslavia
Transphobia is really, really different
And accepting of it
You *have* to be open to weird shit
I'd say the the unique nature of Anime itself means that different people will be attracted to it
That's just people being cunts Alice
```The amount of times I ask people not to make helicopter jokes only to be met with some asshole response is more than I'd like```
What?
Maybe not all of them, but I would wager a majority are
All of the Anime 'things' are just jokes
Save for a select few
The Anime community is pretty much completely aware of their weirdness though.
Trying to 'safebox' media is just a bad idea
Some people are just inclined that way *anyway*
If you want to tell a story about rape, then it inhernetly puts the idea in peoples minds, even if it is completely against it in the media.
And are consequently terrible
Which are so accesable and bland that it's impossible to offend
Solopy, the problem with that is once you start catering to that, you get EA games
Mocking trans rights are a bit below the scale on 'bad ideas'
The difference with this is that the *majority* of people are sinsible enough to see that having sex with children or murdering someone is bad, even if media says it's ok.
I am thinking of people who go on killing-sprees or shoot up schools.
I can't remember *any* that have been atributed to violent games or movies.
(That was worded badly)
The idea might be given to them, but they choose to do it.
Very rarely have I heard of people actually be swayed by media to do thing they wouldn't do ordinarily.
^
I should adjust that statement
Several hours of research I spent looking into it once a few years ago
You are less likely to go looking for someone to have sex with if you can just watch porn
It's the same thing with normal porn really
~~It's been proven~~ Research that I remember reading shows that Pedophiles that can talk to fellow pedophiles and indulge in harmless child porn like Loli stuff are less likely to actually go out to have sex with children.
Humans are already an incredibly violent species though
^
This is a big thing
My sympathies
Your selections must be so slim
I feel sorry for you
But would you call that 'trash' as well?
This argument could be applied to Yuri as well
Just because there *are* people like that in the world doesn't allow you the freedom to brand something 'trash' because some people are weak to temptation
Just not shotacon
^^^
So that argument is kind of moot
People use good things to validate bad actions though
Ignore me
Mis read that
R, you can use that argument for pretty much everything.
People are already like this, they are just actually displaying it to the world
4chan is what happens when people can post whatever they want without consequence
Involving it in a conversation just makes it everything a mess
That place is such a cluterfuck
Don't start on 4chan
But it's difficult to discuss, since those sort of people would be pretty vulnerable to any sort of nudging like that anyway
The problem
'He' is the default because 'they' doesn't work in a lot of sentences
^
Calling a person who has no identified gender on their account 'he' has gotten people angry at me before
I've ran into a lot of people who like to start arguments because I didn't adhere to their own personal guidelines.
That's a false argument R, nor what I was talking about
But a lot of the time they are just being a bother by forcing their ideals on other people
I don't mind them fighting for womens rights or 'justice' on the internet
The problem with SJW's is that they constantly overreach
And I agree with you completely Alice
But some of them are just for fun
Games are heavily drenched in messagery
^
But most fanfiction is mired in shit
As fanfiction proves
I *do* agree that books have a very important influence
It's really preference that steers them I think
Besides, children/teenagers don't think about price
Books can be just as expensive as games
```am i wrong in thinking that it is more expensive to build a wide gaming selection than it is to build a wide reading selection?```
Not really
But god keep it to yourself
I'm all for empowering women
Ugh, the SJW movement is the worst thing to happen in a long time
It really depends on *which* community
Every game has its own community, then another overarching community for the type of game or genre
```Inclusive isn't really the word, since it's more just made nerd/gamer culture more gatekeepy```
Jumping back a little
Some people read a lot, some people barely read books at all
Nowadays, it's up to preference really
I would have to disagree
It's just displayed in a different form
A game that spouts the ideals of Mein Kampf would have the same effect as reading the book itself imo
Just different platforms to convey a message
```between books and video games```
At their core, there really isn't.
But I do agree with you Alice
```nerd/gamer culture being absolutely awful```
I think this is mostly because 'nerd' has slowly come to include anyone who plays games.
And most people are shit.
Maybe it's because I read a lot of books as a kid, but that just seems absurd to me
```have only a grasp of the world through a lens of video games only```
This is a very specific circumstance though.
Since they are inherently easy to influence
I'm not counting young people here
People who can be convinced by things they see in games are the type to be easily influenced by anything anyway, or they already kinda thought that way.
I can't take it even slightly seriously.
That image is stupid.
And no, it was started by R being snippy
Good debate
This was a nice conversation
```ambiguously lesbian schoolgirls.```
```ambiguously lesbian```
```ambiguously```
I would say Sakura Trick, if it *had* a community
If you dare whisper about men...
Solopy, try Madoka
Which unfortunately carries over to Anime
That's normal homophobia though.
I jsut got that
Oh fuck you
```splinter sounding```
No
I refuse
No
*they aren't really*
Splinters are my fetish
WHY ARE WE SHOUTING
FUCK DOORS
YEAH
English has the benefit of nomming words from other languages all the time
*nani*
Only weirdo's use 'Bro' or 'Man'
'Guys' *is* used as gender neutral, but technically it's not by defenition
^
And it shows
English is not designed to accomadate for not knowing the gender of the person you are talking to
Yes
'Guy's' really isn't gender neutral
...
At least for me
He or She makes it easier to build up a persona to an account
Using 'they' in my head makes it hard to... picture? the person
I write a ton, so my wording habits come entirely from there
It's just not something that I think about
Ignoring that, anyway.
Yes, I probably should try to use 'they' more often
...
```which is especially annoying when you go "have a serious conversation" and then just basically not only not listen, but embody alice's points```
I have listened, agreed and disagreed with Alice multiple time here
Wonders never cease
I know, and I used your in the same sentence
Just so you can say 'I don't believe you'
What is the point of that post
R, why even bring that point up?
This
^^^
If they are offended by being called 'he' when your gender isn't set, then it's their own damn fault.

I need to quote this
```there is a strong heterosexuality eminating from that dildo```
How rude
```is that ships love grinding against each other```
USS Washington never forgetti
Sorry, relfex

```Queen can refer to the monarch or Freddy```
Not sure what you mean, Queen is the same person
Yes, they are

My PC is my girl
I call things gender names all the time
```With English we don‚Äôt assign gender to items. ```

```laughs in non-gender finnish```
Finnish isn't a real language, it's just Eastern Swedish
*It's fucking magical*
The fact that your language is so similar to English, as in it uses English letters, but isn't never ceases to amaze me
```You have to confirm you're over 18 to access any NSFW channels on discord```

Scotland is a wee bit far from the south, but if you really want one?
The hardest words are the ones you want to say.
I think there are more of them on the internet than people realise, they just say they are more often on here. (Correct me if I'm wrong)
That's so bad

Freedom is *my* safe word
Safe word is Panopticon
*Must squish*
I wish I could sleep tight with Tiny Miku

That's, well, stupid
You can't just ban the word stupid
...
Still, I feel like the heart of the issue is that the word 'Trap' is being used on transgender people who aren in no way attempting to 'trap' people?
I want to understand the root of the issue here
Words fall into and out of use as time passes, true enough
Barbarian for one
IIRC we use a lot of words that have racist roots
But we still use it
The word Humanity is inherently sexist
I'm sure it *has*
I've never seen the word used in a 'transphobic' way though
Mmm
Which is kind of the crux of this
The word means something entirely different now though.
But I just don't get this sentence
I've not talked to any people who are transphobic mind you
Is this true though?
```It‚Äôs based on the fear that gender non-conforming people want to entrap innocent people into having sex with them, which we‚Äôll get into later.```
The article itself does a lot of projecting as well
And of the people on the 2018 lsit for murdered Trans, none of them are confirmed to be hate crimes
Most of the links seem broken
```what about the article do you want to discuss```
Generally, it's a very disjointed article, it makes a lot of points but they don't really seem to link together very well
Just that he last time I tried to have a conversation with Alice I got kicked
R, that has nothing to do with the rules
I never even said anything about rules in DM today
Debate the rules
*Not*
I understand that you are using the article as the basis of your opinion on the rule, and I was hoping to discuss the things found in said article
But you *started* this conversation
And now you don't?
You *just* told me that if I want to talk about it I should do so here
...
Since you have clearly stated that you want me to continue the discussion *here*
Alice, can I actually question you about the article you linked me without fear of being kicked because you don't like me discussing the points?
TL;DR, culture > words
:V
Saying Hallo?
Hallo is a greeting R
They sound like they are always angry
Have you *heard* German?
A very angry language
german
^
```these days I just dont even attempt to deal with genders. easier just to deal with people as they are.```
x-san is objectively best adjective
I often call friends 'asshole' with a nod
R, it can be a hostile greeting
Huh
I'm out of date for this word apparently
```Fr√§ulein```
Really, when did this change?
I can say 'Hello' in the most offensive way possible and it will eventually mean a bad thing
```If everyone walked around calling people who made bad decisions "intellectually disabled" with venom in their words, that'd be offensive too soon enough```
This is the crux of literally any word though
Which really doesn't sound better
Apparently the politically correct term is 'Intellectual disability'
I'm sure there is a newer word for that anyway
It's a word for describing people who are of lesser intelligence?

Just, people using it out of context
Since the word itself is fine in context
I kind of don't understand this one
Retarded used to be a medical term, they changed it because everyone started using it
Ahh, Asians, the most racist of people
Yori, you live in England too right?
It it just me, because I've just... not really seen much racism about?

I mean, there is some, the whole Polish and Nepalese thing, but that isn't that major.
```i mean, we are starting to actually care about ourselves in a way```
I don't actually think that's the case.
It's more than people care less about what other people are doing with their lives so long as they keep to themselves.
More so in some places than others
What?
But only we get to do that
We love to insult them and they insult us back
The Scotish and the English have a very long running Tsundere love/hate relationship
```i believe we call that privilege, the fact that being white kinda removes a fuckload of slurs```
How do you know I'm white?
Because I have thick skin?
I dunno, I don't give a shit what other people think about me
No
No, I've never been offended by a slur before
Yes, obviously
Since everyone else was posting some
I was just using them as examples
I don't have an issue with them
They are still slurs
Should it matter if they are obscure or not?
~~Even better~~
Ignore that
...
I'll bungle ur ass
Chocolate

With great effort
yeah it does
I mean, do you want me to list out every single Asian country/race rather than use 'Asian' ?
It's true though
You know that Asian people are incredibly racist to anyone who isn't of their race?
Not what you meant
*Oh*
Alice, Asian people are generally very racist

```wasn't brexit fueled by racism?```
Nationalism, mostly.

Also people generally being fuckheads

Kids don't give a shit

But I've kinda not noticed a lot in the last few years
I remember there being some racial tension when I was younger
Religion is often used as an excuse for bad acts, so I think it's more that they attract bad people

Chrome is so RAM hungry

I can only wear over-ear headsets
Earbuds hurt like a bitch after 20 minutes or so
ugh
Whenever I look into other headsets, they are all too heavy to wear for the amount of time I do
And they are pretty waterproof
The 202's are so light that they are easy to wear out
Also use them while I'm out
I wear these constantly
Once that I can wear for 14+ hours a day
I need to move on to a different type

Iris just acts like a bully
Femdom is fine, so long as both parties are actually fine with it.
Does it count as 'Consent' if they are going along with her because they don't want to be tortured?
That's not kosher
Not to mention that she *literally* rapes several characters over the course of RB;3
Whenever she enters a scene every character suddenly starts acting completely out of character and they bend to whatever her whims happen to be
Iris Heart is terrible
Iris Heart is worse

America did a lot of War Crimes‚Ñ¢ that no-one talks about

```as tanks developed armour too thick for the Lahti to penetrate its uses switched to long range sniping, tank harassment and with the L-39/44 fully automatic variant, employment as an improvised anti-aircraft weapon.```
It should be capable of knocking out pretty much any half-track, except Russia didn't use any of them
I can't imagine it doing well against a T-34
Against T-26's?
It literally *can't* be fired fast enough to melt the barrel
Also, as an AT Rifle it shouldn't be fired fast enough to need barrel cooling
It's going to be used in *Finland*
Why does it have the holes in the barrel?
Springs still work fine if they are cold though
Is it because it's cold?
Literally no other 20mm AT Rifle has had this problem
*Why*
Do you have to manually crank the spring inside?

Why is the bolt at the bottom?

Did you know that Hitler put another 20mm of armour on the front of the Panther that it *really* didn't need?
Actually, Germany made a lot of minor mistakes that can be blamed on Hitler
Just moved around it
They never should have tried to take Stalingrad
To be fair, if America hadn't meddled and Hitler had kept his mouth shut, they probably would have won
*Kek*
They had so much land and resources and were a minor power at most
Historically, for the longest time Russia was just a massive dissapointment
Mother Nature > All
So yeah
But, they didn't
And would have beat Germany
If they had just put another 10,000 men at the bridge, they would have stopped the blitzkrieg
They just made a mistake
Had better tanks and soldiers
In 1939 France was stronger than Germany
Quite a lot
They really didn't expect that Germany could get so many tanks through a massive forest so quickly
They just didn't leave as many troops in a spot than they should have
To be fair, Frances battle plans for WW2 were very good
This happened *all the fucking time* in WW1
How is that any different to a French General telling their troops to do the same?
15,000 brave Canadians vs one boggy boi
99% of WWI was taking pointless land
One massive victory does not make a country
Canada did just as much dying as the rest of the sides
Pff
When they did basically jack shit on the ground
America very deliberately stole all of the credit both times
But they were useful meatshields
France mostly died in WWI
Probably true
You can say they didn't do *everything*, but they very much did a *lot*
Flat out
That's a lie
