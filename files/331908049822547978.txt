Well, actually, no

Was asking for birthday-specific channels for so long
So happy to see this tbh
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Wouldn't hurt. The issue with an anime and manga channel being one thing is the userbase.
Thanks
Ohh I see.
If Yggdrasil grabs art sources from pixiv, what about Twitter?
Ahhh alright, thanks.
Just curious since I feel with how I want to share pics of my dog often, I wouldn't want to share it in a place like general since that'd just disrupt the conversation flow, and <#336297674707828747> and <#336297808221044736> are suited to art.
Would an IRL channel for pets/selfies/etc. be something to consider?
So it worked out
Sorry, I just remember on the Wonder Egg server I mod this topic came up. We did eventually dub our gaming channel <#337805317276565525>-tech
Ahhh right.
If we have <#337805317276565525>, how would a #tech channel sound? Sometimes I really wanna talk about PC stuff, but given how there's a game channel there, I don't want to disrupt the conversation flows
And imo I find it a little odd to see it utilized like this, where you could potentially kill several chats because everyone's using threads and nobody's using the actual chats.
This "thread" thing is something a mod on the Animemes server worked on for their bot before solely to discuss specific things with an anime/series/etc. so it doesn't flood one channel.
Hell, the Animemes server too
We're seeing threads spring up once so often on Wonder Egg
Threads is a nice advantage for people who want to vent with <#336297840529899522>
The manga also really doesn't spoil much I notice. It's just your average SoL manga.
Would make posting comics easier on mobile and whatnot.
If you see a Twitter image with more than one picture, you type in the command above and it extracts all the images to post them at once.
I mentioned it in <#336297808221044736>
i.e. You see a tweet with 3 images and you just type ```9_twitter (link here)``` or something
I think it'd be cool if Ygg could do that same thing. Or whatever bot seems capable of pulling multiple images from one set.
A bot on another discord I'm in has this ability to get multiple images in a set from Pixiv/Twitter/etc.
Something like that
```9_iam Color Me Hibiki Icon```
Icons would be cool, though idk how we'd go about integrating it into roles
Everyone just has a small icon next to their name
This is how it looks on a server I'm in
Can see that working just as well
i.e. if I had a Chris role, Zenbu would be next to my name along with other people who have said role
It's a small icon that goes next to whatever role you have.
Yeah I've been seeing this on another server. It'd be cool.
My name is one of those dead giveaways that I happen to really like Maria art/Maria
Ahhh ok.
I'd love to never miss a Maria piece when it's new or ping people who like Hibiki for a new piece
Would a role for pinging people for specific characters be of interest?
And translators like Yandex, Google Translate, etc. aren't going to be pinpoint accurate.
TL;DR it'd be hard for mods to moderate a bilingual chat since most of us don't speak other languages
On the Wonder Egg server I mod, we *did* have this discussion before
Ohhh totally understandable
I do really want to eventually stream Metroid Prime if I decide to get around to playing those games knowing a few people really like the Metroid series
So random question: Why is streaming disabled for people on the server?
I think it'd be worth giving that a shot. A bot on another server I'm in is able to post Pixiv images up to a certain limit for instance.
If the embed command works for Twitter, would Pixiv work too?
Yep. That's kinda where I got the idea from. Except this time, it's appropriately tweaked towards Geah. I'm just throwing an extra idea out for the hell of it since I know the 10th anniversary is a month away, so it might be cool to get that in
For the 10th anniversary, I think it'd be pretty interesting to have a Google form relating to people's opinions on the series. Their favorite seasons, characters, hype moments, etc.
Doesn't really bother Discord.
We do that as well and we're discord partnered.
Yeah.
What makes streaming it on a service like Kast anymore legal then?
Ahhh.
Huh? I've seen people stream anime before on Discord before. One discord server I'm in for Animemes does this in a groupwatch format just like you're doing and nobody's been terminated yet.
It'd be nice since currently at the end of this year I'm rewatching Yuuki Yuuna, but hey. Getting to tread on Symphogear ground again after I devoted time to rewatching it last year (at least, rewatching S1-GX and experiencing AXZ/XV for the first time) would be nice.
I think we could watch it via someone streaming it instead of kast.gg, since discord's in-streaming thing is pretty solid.
Wow, I'd *love* to rewatch Geah with you all!
Oohhh
We need a separate channel with Shem-Ha quotes. Just submit them to an Alchemist or something
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097> should be renamed to :dessgusting:
:KanaGay:
Will birthday art sharing channels be open next year? I remember when I joined and looked at the archives I saw channels of people posting character art relating to that character's birthday. And up until yesterday, only <#658798535734591540> was unarchived. Hoping that next year birthday art channels will be unarchived as I'd love to participate.
Will <#658798535734591540> be unarchived for tomorrow?
I thought it did. I remember it told me when I tried to view the full size image to login.
Yeah that too.
I've done this multiple times unfortunately
I guess to me having a Pixiv exploding image thing is nice since I can see people forgetting to click on the image and uploading one in a poor/low resolution
I think an "exploded image" thing might also be a little less convenient spoiler tag wise since the recent discord update fixed multiple images uploading in reverse order.
Right exactly.
I guess it's just me being frustrated since I saw this on another discord and considering Ygg is kinda meant to be a utility bot, and it has a command similar to the one I know of, I figured having a Pixiv command would be something worth discussing.
Eh... Right
There. I'm done taking about this shit.
Then fuck, I've got the stupidest fucking ideas.
I forget the command but I remember it's used for spol tagging images with the bot or something
On the same discord I got the idea from, they do have a built in spoiler feature.
I just like being able to preserve art I like.
I mainly like exploding images for the fact that Twitter artists might remove an art piece you like. Just poof, the art's gone and nowhere else has the source.
You're right.
Say I wanted to just use the exploding link for a single image like I saw someone do with a Twitter link yesterday.
For the most part my idea for this is that most of the time Pixiv art can be displayed a lot lower quality if you don't click the image and get the full one.
This isn't as big as other Discords I know of, but I can kinda agree with that statement.
From what I saw on one discord I'm in that just limits it to around 10 images if there's more than 10.
Fair I guess...
It's just convenient for most people since, like Twitter, sometimes there's multiple images in a given compilation and it's probably convenient for those who want to see the full resolution pics in order.
We haven't received a penalty for using ToS to stream
This has been done before on the Wonder Egg server (which is partnered btw)
Can anyone stop this woman? I don't think so.
Kanade is so powerful she's taken LGBT Pride itself
Sounds nice.
I'd be down for y'all to watch uh... uhm... Lain maybe? It is a slow burn series but I'd enjoy explaining the wtf elements the most I can
But I had no idea it had that groupwatch thing attached to it
Ya know, being a newer member of the server I just assumed <#371105434771390465> was a nod to that scene in G
Hm... then I'd say do it if you want. I just thought it was an important thing
Scrolling through past announcements, the last everyone ping was a long ass time ago
The team doesn't really use <#336300750248476693> super often anyway outside of writing prompts who are currently taking a hiatus
That's fair.
Oh.
That's what I was thinking, given there was one for phishing awhile ago
Yes
Might wanna toss an announcement up about this
https://discord.com/discord-recruitment-scams
It was just an idea for the sake of an idea
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
It's not like I was complaining about it.
Yeah, alright.
I know, that's not the intention
I probably should've DMed Rakhi or someone in retrospect, but I figured this was an idea that anyone should peek. Considering how often GX/AXZ discussions are. I suppose that's the flaw with an anime that ended 3 years ago. You're stuck cycling through like 3 or 4 different topics. Dr. Ver this, Tomato Arc that.
Random suggestion for writing prompts:

Considering the mixed reaction on GX and AXZ, I think it'd make for an interesting month to read people's versions of the events of both seasons. Think of it as a means to spark discussion outside of <#336310266654490624> about how much better the series could've been if (x) was (y). i.e. Miku being more involved, Adam doing more than dicking around in a bathtub, etc. There's a wealth of ideas in wanting to rewrite GX and AXZ, and I feel for those who often browse the <#336310266654490624> channel, it would add a nice way to blow off steam given how this topic is almost always a point of contention.
As for the April Fools prank this year I expect it to be fun. I heard the one last year was amogus
Not meant for this channel honestly. But TL;DR I was just being stupidly edgy
Stupid shit.
I'm surprised you didn't know that
April 2020 was not a good time. üö¨
Exciting stuff ahead
Excited to see how this server does April Fools honestly. Sad I couldn't have made it for last year's considering how I was unbanned in June but hey
I'd imagine. I was just kicking around ideas 'cuz I had these joke channel names on my mind
<#680064398735311064> is #salt-mines
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ST42VjR0LYk
<#336298054724485131> could be #i-lost-the-run-to-rng-dude
I ran out of steam after the first few channels <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Channel name ideas for April Fools:

<#336297387863703552>  is #im-not-brave-enough-for-politics
<#336297840529899522> is #politics
<#384870333620027403> is #no-text-shitpost-zone
<#407060923078017026> is #longehost-watches-another-bad-ecchi-anime
<#336310266654490624> is #tomato-arc-best-arc
<#357682999300718592> is #free-idea-channel

idk if I'd rename <#928339153488326686> to anything, nor any of the hobbies and interests. Maybe <#803824240494903338> becomes #bug-man-action-channel?
I'd be down for:

Flip Flappers
Lain
Gridman/Dynazenon
i.e.
Idk, just the idea of people being able to find this server given how big it is. I know a few people who might wanna look for it just for the emotes but I like the idea of it being public just cuz anyone who wants to can click on an emote and join a server just by finding it
(like <#336297840529899522> and <#407060923078017026>)
Ehhh, I notice it more with partnered. For server discovery to even be enabled you *have* to enable the image restrictions. But it wouldn't check channels labeled NSFW
I guess you could probably archive <#336297808221044736> for admin purposes and replace it with another
Well, the thing is with stuff like the Animemes server they went public awhile ago and got to keep their nsfw channels
Huh?
Classic theme is based
I've met a certain number of people (and I even used to before deleting my account) who used New
I was thinking making the server public would make it easier for those interested in Geah/have watched it to find the place because, as mentioned earlier, there really isn't any other way to find it other than New Reddit
Exactly.
Pretty much most people on r/symphogear know each other.
As a flaw of the anime being more popular, it meant a lot of the older people were being scared away.
i was super active in it at one point, then goign partnered and making the server public meant a lot of the older people I knew were shying away.
Ehh... yeah. That was my one issue with Wonder Egg discord.
Oh wait I forgot they like .com now instead of gg
The only other way I can imagine people finding this is typing 'Symphogear" with <discord.gg>
On New Reddit they have a link to the discord
But the server is active enough as is imo
That's the biggest advantage. It'd also maybe help maybe boost activitiy slightly.
^
On the Animemes server they made a layer of security where there's a verification channel. You have to verify you read the rules with a bot command
There'd definitely be more scam bots involved
^
That's fair
I was just saying that the idea of that sounds fine because I know other servers that have done this and I think it'd be nice for people to be able to find this server outside of niche resources
Well that's not necessarily my intention with this but damn, alright.
I ask this given how Symphogear appeals to a certain niche, so it'd be interesting to see some new faces around here without them finding it via new reddit or just looking up "Symphogear discord" and being taken here.
Channels like <#407060923078017026> and <#336297840529899522> wouldn't be detected by the bot as well as <#336297808221044736>
Do y'all think of making this a "public" server? As in, something you could find via server discovery? Afaik you just have to set it up so that the discord bot detects explicit images everywhere except "NSFW" channels. But that also means you might have to make <#336297674707828747> one since it does have its hiccups
Yep!
When the time comes, may I suggest we make a poll as to what we can rename the server? Knowing that it's separate from the subreddit and all.
I can imagine those who do use "New" are mostly gonna find the sub through there
I'll admit I did use it in the time I did use Reddit but I can understand a majority not using it
"Symphogear Valkyries" is the name of the other one
I guess in that case, what would the server be named if /r/symphogear were to receive a rename? "Symphogear Community Discord" sounds generic, but works I guess?
Not there on Old
Still there on New Reddit
I know the latter was how I found it the first time
I guess that begs the question of if you're separate from the sub, could you maybe update the description to match this? Though I imagine most of the traffic this place gets is from the unique link name or finding the discord on the sub's sidebar
So for future reference, say, if there was a thing I'd wanna see updated server-wise that you, Lily, or Kerrik could do, I send it here?
They're only really in charge of writing announcements for their part of the server afaik
Which is fair.
I'll try to remember that next time.
Ah, thanks.
But I see this as a grounds for suggesting anything. I suggested an idea for writing prompts, which is part of the server.
I'm unsure of the "and the subreddit" part tbh
> "A channel for public suggestions for both the server and the subreddit."
Not in a "Wow, I'm tired of hearing about this" sense, but more of a "I wanna read people's interpretations of things."
I just had the idea of "Oh hey it'd be cool for writing prompts to try this since I know people talk about it a lot"
Not like I participate as often anyway
Not to get super snippy or anything
No need to jump to the conclusion of "Oh you're tired of hearing about it? Don't join in"
I'm double gay whooooooo!
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
If I'm bi does it count?
/j
Stupid fucking hamster, learn to read!!! üò† üò† üò†
That being said
No one's really pissed off at someone legitimately since we all just kinda understand who we are and interact pretty good on a day-to-day basis
At the end of the day, the server's pretty nice and tight knit
Everyone here is chill and even when I have my small bursts of anger like I did up there with Hibiki, it's normally brushed off
I think that's why I love this place so much
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
Instead of "Hey I agree on that" or "I disagree on that"
And those who do help deconstruct the ideas regardless. Whenever something is suggested in this channel, it is at least given valid counters.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
And Hibiki
Thanks, Matt.
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
I fuckin' corrected myself, thanks.
I'm used to being burned.
But hey, it's fine
I dunno why I suggest anything since a lot of the ideas tend to get shot down in all seriousness
I always suggest the shit that'll never work
<:PensiveIllya:581911541629190248>
I'm beginning to understand the flaws of my suggestion
Yeah
I'm not necessarily for it, though I like the idea of some alternate way of getting the name out there
But in all seriousness, yeah I think this idea is a mixed bag.
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
No wait that's Mythra
Especially with the people I've seen come and go moderating Wonder Egg
Oh yeah I really get that
Pyra was a w*eb?!?!?! üò≥
Yeah.
But yeah... there have definitely been morons banned from the Animemes server 'cuz mods don't fuck around there. Especially after they banned a certain slur that isn't allowed here.
I don't necessarily endorse it, I just like the idea of getting a small influx of new people
I was just suggesting the idea is all.
Yeah, that is a fair point
Oh yeah
I just thought that since I see the Animemes server listed as "Public" and other places that it'd be worth tossing the idea out there.
Again, I can understand people's issues really.
Ahhh I see
'cuz it is a nice and cozy server. Having all the new people here would probably scare older people away. I saw it happen with Wonder Egg server.
But I can understand the opposition
I feel this would just help get the name out there since the only other place to find us is through new reddit
I'm not super on board with it either
Again, I was just suggesting it
Which is fair
(The server is a lot better than the subreddit trust me)
You can click this and it shows "Animemes"
<:BocchiHands:660933135050997781>
In general I view that channel as a "misc media" channel given I've seen hobby stuff posted there prior.
^ Yeah, about how I feel too.
Would <#407060923078017026> be a good channel for dumping misc. videos? Earlier I linked a Techmoan vid there and Fig suggested I link it in general, so I am pondering on that since I know <#407060923078017026> isn't just used for memes. It's also used for stuff regarding tanks, airplanes, etc.
Now that I think about it, wouldn't #books also have comic discussion in it?
On the WEP server I mod I remember us making #animanga because we initially had the channels split. But when manga wasn't being used as much, the anime channel there since the server's inception got renamed
^
Just so those who like manga don't disrupt <#371105434771390465>
Yeah. I suppose it'd also be a means to have a proper manga channel too.
#books?
I'd say put live action media if its there. But now I ponder on what the name would be
That'd be super cool
They've done that with the ongoing anniversary rewatch before
I think the idea of a shifting birthday channel works best because you wouldn't want the archives to be cluttered
So I think it'd be an int idea to make a birthday channel either rotating between characters*or" you can unarchive one of the birthday channels dependent on who it is.
With character birthdays being a thing, do you think it'd be a good idea to have a channel in the general Geahcord posting space for each birthday? I noticed there were some of those in the archives and I remembered when <#658798535734591540> got a revival for her birthday
/j
Mel bullying me <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Ahhh ty
September maybe?
I'd gun for a late 2022 announcement
Ahhh yeah
Not sure if G or S1 had one, but considering this is the new box set it'd be nice to say "Hey, DiscoTek just announced GX on Blu Ray"
Think we could get an announcement for the GX boxset?
Alice is cool from what little I've talked with them.
Description: "You can like everyone else, but Shirabe is superior"
"Shirabe Worship Center"
Thanks, Mel.
Oh I see.
So I guess my next question is... what exactly will the server be renamed to if anything? I asked this one a few days ago, but considering we're split from the subreddit, would there be a poll on what it should be renamed?
I'm asking as there's a few messages in the past while I saw that people would want pinned, but mods don't pin something unless it's important
Have you considered adding a starboard? I feel that with how certain people wish to have specific massages pinned that it'd be nice to have.
Yep
So... what if there was a #tech channel? I feel that <#337805317276565525> is a nice enough place for tech discussions, but knowing how <@719658405911855174> does talk tech sometimes, as do I, it'd be nice to have a separate place to talk about computer hardware and such without derailing a conversation.
I think it'd be cool to get everyone's thoughts on the series. Poll the favorite/least favorite seasons and all
Would be down for a 10th anniversary poll sometime this year
Ahhhh
Idk
I think it'd be interesting to have the writing prompts team try it out
I'd be down to write something
That'd be cool. Could also work with the writers and have 'em write anniversary short stories too
Kirika is a popular character people draw so it really works
I think it's a good idea
"Hey, for (x)'s birthday, character art and stories for them are an exception to the usual rule one hour rule"
Perhaps tomorrow you could pin something for the grace period?
Ohhh right
Having a thread to contain content in sounds manageable given the grace period
It'd be good. I think birthday art is great, but this makes me wish for a thread
I knew it, Winglet was bribing you the whole time!
<a:HibikiPowerDab:688190074219003996>
Same bot that hit me with "Skill issue" too
Yeah.
We need a Shem-Ha quote channel cuz some of these are just too funny
I have <#371105434771390465> whenever I wanna post Manga/Comic stuff, like yesterday
Kind of a shame <#407060923078017026> is an NSFW channel, though I mean... given that you can live blog saucier stuff in there if you wish
But if you're looking for someone with experience, <:ChrisWave:738169593574719568>
So I think I'd be all good
I retired from modding WEPcord a good 2 or 3 weeks ago by this point
I'd love to help out but idk if I'd exactly be "worthy" of mod status, given I've been here a year and all
Would suggest running a google form or something. Hire a few regulars.
^
I recall <#658798535734591540> got unarchived for Chris' birthday
So... with Tsubasa's birthday coming up, will <#581494826793566236> be unarchived?
It's a channel only the bot gets to post in, anyway.
Starboard as a system is normally just highlighting chat messages and nothing less. Moderators can set the normal amount of stars required to reach the board, cutting out the clutter
Or memes, or highlights
Other servers I've been on normally fill it with art
I figured a starboard would help because it takes out the equation of possibly running out of pins
Hm. I was just suggesting it knowing sometimes there are messages I would wanna see pinned, either due to them being funny or just finding them to be general highlights
So the idea balances itself out I feel
I've noted some starboard bots can also not allow for NSFW channels to have messages in there starred, but other times there'll be a separate starboard meant for NSFW
And considering Mel has said seeing the pins is hard for her but she doesn't want to erase history, it'd be nice to have something for the community to have as you could star art, messages, etc.
I just DM whenever I see anything going south
^
It's ok
Yeah, this is more just a drop in the bucket at the end of the day
So she gets my vote
I'd say Ten being a mod is one of the best options, as she's

A. Been here a long time
B. Best friends with Melua
C. Very neutral
^
I'd see a problematic user and scope 'em out a little.
I also have a very "Fuck around and find out" personality when it comes to moderating, that's kind of what I did on WEPcord
Yeah. That's true.
I'd like to try, given my experience with WEPcord. You could ask <@405049915719286794> for more information, but I served there a year and did announcements and helped out in terms of shaping the server
Ten is a longtime friend of Melua, and in the SEA timezone
Yeah, I'd agree there
I think there should be mods, but have some that apply be put on trial
I'd say the best course of action would to be running a google form that asks a few basic modding questions, your experience, etc.
Especially with that much experience backing up Kirika alone.
She and Ten seem fairly reasonable candidates imo
Yes.
We did that for <#658798535734591540>
Does this mean tomorrow we'll have <#581494826793566236> unarchived to post Basa bday art?
Discord has a habit of dropping updates and them being busted
But I can normally tell when something's changed up
I never really join VCs much cuz shyness
^
Yes
I remember that being a topic brought up recently
Idk
I think that maybe if this option gets explored, we *could* tie it into the need for more mods?
Yeah true
Pros:

- Useful for watchalongs/gameplay streaming

Cons:

- Can't support bots
- Can't ping
That'd be nice. With people wanting to revive <#371105434771390465> and all, that's a plus
I was just confused
Sorry for not picking up on that
Huh, that's neat.
Ohhhhh
I'm curious about these features
New VC chat features?
<:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
You did tell us to link offenders in <#336299268107403274> in the announcement so I did my part
Glad I could be of help!
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
~~That too~~
I'd say that a kick would be better over a ban. Banning someone because they post RP account stuff seems a little petty.
It's an RP account
Found another account to add to the blacklist:
https://discord.com/channels/336297387863703552/336297674707828747/984065542040195072
Yeah, I'd like to see that toned down a bit. After all, I've just been helping to keep the score is all.
Read: She just spammed <a:APetForElfnein:753351098835927230>
I'm sure Melua gave her a stern talking to
Channels got morbed
Yeah, like that time she tripped and the server got all messed up
Suggestions compiled into a list:

1. Moderation form
2. Look into bots
3. Look into stream chat function
That's why most servers build their own bot for logging joins/leaves/messages/etc.
Audit log is weird that way, yeah
But I think it'd be nice to establish a proper channel to discuss tech given how it's mixed at the moment on where to discuss it
I do normally throw tech stuff in <#977744682035605514> atm because aside memes and let's plays, it's a grab-all channel imo
But yes, this would be a great idea
And Yumi said I don't think before I post <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I'd been thinking about this for awhile, too.
That's exactly my point.
Like I said, I knew someone who was wanting to share PC stuff awhile ago but due to how the channels are, yeah.
Yep!
Gee, thanks.
That's pretty blunt, Yumi.
I never come up with a good idea, do I?
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
I'm just noting how PCs get discussed a lot and I know of someone who is wanting to talk about them often. So I figured it'd be a great idea to rename a channel just so we don't bloat the server with one that might not get used.
Mmm, understandable
I think this would be a fine idea considering there's PC talk at times, and normally PC discussion goes hand in hand with gaming.
On a different suggestion, have y'all thought about possibly renaming <#337805317276565525> to <#337805317276565525>-and-tech?
I'll try.
I didn't take that into account, I just was used to one way of thinking about it. Sorry for once again contributing something useless. But I'm used to it by this point...
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
Ok, I get it. My suggestion was shit.
I just know that most servers like to put the boost in some channel so it doesn't accidentally drop during a conversation
Ohh fair
I know we don't get boosted often but it'd be nicer to have it there than <#336297387863703552>
I think <#368973801561653253> would be a better spot for boost notifications
I'm not wanting to push anything, I just remembered it was a recurring thing I saw brought up and with how there's plenty of regulars volunteering, I imagine there's been a bit of discussion
So... Has a consensus been reached on moderation applications yet?
Maria's motherly instincts just activated <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Yeah there's that.
I suppose it is.
I recall toying around with the idea of a thread for LPing Berseria, but that instead got turned into <#977744682035605514>
Honestly threads are a good idea, but as mentioned, admins *always* shoot down the idea
Figure I'd use this channel as general questioning for the bots if that's not an issue
How many queues does the image query bot go through? I've noticed Ygg in the past while has been hitting us with "Too Many Requests" a few times. And I'm curious on if there's a set number of times before the bot stops functioning.
I think it'd be cool to possibly give a role relating to watchalongs. Have someone be given "mod powers" but they're limited to just event creation.
I noticed during the S1 rewatch, Lily used the event thing to promote the start of it
So... another question: I am aware that <#371105434771390465> will be utilized in the future for specific watchalongs, so I am curious if you'll use the event thing again during it.
New mods would be a nice step, if only to at least have more active people at all times.
But back on topic, I'm intrigued in at least seeing how things structure wise are bound to change in the future.
I'm an overthinking mess, I know.
Sorry.
Oh
But I'm just not too happy with being flat out told "I'm wrong" instead of ya know, explaining *why*
Perhaps I'm reading a bit too into this
The smug emote begs to differ.
God, this is the second time you've flat out told me something along the lines of "Oh looks like you're wrong" and honestly that's irritating. Imagine telling someone who's already kind of easy to get pissy that "Hey looks like I was on point."
No need to rub it in, Rady.
But my main point being for a series built around music, I'd regardless have it.
Even if it is mostly me shilling 90s alt rock and video game music
Also I feel a Symphogear server without a music channel would be weird
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
I notice the art channels are the most active, then <#336297387863703552>, <#977744682035605514>, and sometimes <#371105434771390465>
Ntm the traffic of certain channels is already hit or miss dependent on what it is.
Those are valid points.
Just cuz I don't wish to disrupt general
I also just use the shitposting channels like I mentioned yesterday for certain ones
Yep
Will it hit the sides though?
I was just onboard with the idea to have a channel *rename* just so there'd be a properly defined part to drop content relating to it on the server.
Mmm. That's acceptable I suppose.
Also I normally post tech-related content in <#977744682035605514> like that video discussing that cool record player/CD hybrid.
I think that it's generally nice to have a defined channel for PC hardware discussion, as it's been mentioned that between <#336297387863703552> and <#337805317276565525>, PC discussion has no defined channel.
Thanks for your input.
Matt and Kerrik are best friends, as you can see
I suppose? I was looking at it more as how it's a hobby/interest, but that could work too.
If they made the channel, where would it even go? Just under <#567740255273222175>? Between <#337805317276565525> and <#567740255273222175>?
Valid.
A new channel with the intent of doingw hat something like <#371105434771390465> does where you discuss things like computers, general science, etc. would be great.
Honestly yeah
<:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
Especially how moderation for them could be nightmarish, and that the lifespan of a thread can be incredibly dependent.
Now, I'm aware of the negatives of a thread.
Anyway, I think it'd be interesting to at least try a thread for tech if they aren't sold on the idea on expanding <#337805317276565525> into a channel to include tech.
Thanks.
Sorry for getting pissy again, I seem to be fantastic at getting easily upset over minor shit everyday, right?
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
Like no shit captain obvious, I don't think mods working on stuff behind the scenes and not hearing much about it is bad
I wasn't outright saying something was bad
I love how people interject my statements with certain things when I'm just pointing out how certain things work
Yeah, I wasn't saying it was fuckin' bad
I'm sure there has, but as far as we know, Geahcord mods do a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff so you almost never hear about it.
But with some of the recent issues like scam links and all, I'm surprised that there really hasn't been progress towards a mod application form.
I know that the server has around 2K people-ish
I've been a hard pusher for more mods/a mod application form mainly because of how small the mod team is.
Embarrassed is missing the extra r
<:ShirabeEmbarassed:336657288477671436>
I noticed a typo in one of the emotes
If we have a nitro emotes server, I wonder on how many slots this one has
I'm on another server where they have these for ROR2 and a few other games
Like AMQ and the Rewatch role, I think it'd be nice to have a role or two for specific games people enjoy playing i.e. Bloons or Risk of Rain 2. They can ping the role to ask if anyone wants to play just like the AMQ role for instance
Tyty
Ahhh.
Yeah I vaguely remember Alchemist being a role, though that was probably retired a little after my time.
Ahhh. I was just poking at the roles.
Perhaps the Illuminati role? That'd prob allow them to tweak the bot in a hidden channel and the likes
I think Sapphire should be given a role that allows them to tweak the bot for specific channels
Yeah, that's what I meant to say.
By that I of course mean with 100 searches, does it refresh those every so often throughout a day?
So whenever there are too many requests, it normally means it needs to refresh for a few seconds?
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
I just like using what resources I have and liveposting was the one channel I thought was cool to share things in.
I'm sorry.
But with games I'll obviously try cutting the fat. With Xenosaga I happen to try cutting most of the random encounters. Only highlighting them if they're a new enemy or something.
Yeah. It doesn't help I have the wrist case of ADHD so I normally go at anime watching for awhile trying to finish it.
I thought I had been pretty good with this kinda thing. Sharing my experiences and wanting to share the story of whatever I was watching or playing with everyone.
Sorry everyone.
So I should apologize I suppose for throwing people off that channel...
But when I first started liveposting I was pretty excited to be able to screenshot things and have fun with it.
It's ok Phanta.
I'm just more for screenshotting my way through things like with Xenosaga.
Hm... Interesting.
I'm just an overthinking mess.
Yeah it really isn't.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Sorry. My overthinking brain strikes again.
Oh
I try my fuckin best alright?
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
It's almost like everyone wishes to upset me nowadays.
Also idk why Sapphire would decide to randomly block me again but <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It's ok, I'd understand.
Sorry for getting salty earlier. I'm trying to get things under control.
Yeah. Can agree with that one.
Yeah. That's what I was thinking.
Just back to back for one thing.
Yeah... I suppose I could do the title thing in every post. But the issue I have there is the tedium of adding it to every image.
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
What fuckin' ever. I wanted to livepost Revue because it's something I enjoy and I feel pretty shitty now for even thinking about it.
<:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
That's... Fine...
Yeah. I make sure to mention it's Revue.
This seems like something that could have been here earlier. And yeah, same. It's nice to have around and I really appreciate it.
Having a channel for sfw memes and posting of anime and games was a good idea knowing how <#407060923078017026> is restricted to certain age groups. Yes.
I think it's working out well. After all, I suggested the concept solely to share games/anime/etc. and think it's serving its purpose well. Remember: I suggested it mainly because of the disadvantage of a friend not being able to see my thoughts on Berseria and me not wanting to take it to DMs.
^
Ahhhhh
Sorry if that meant deleting the emote to rename it or anything
<:ShirabeEmbarrassed:336657288477671436>
Huh, glad I could make such a small change then I suppose
üëÄ
But uhhh yeah, I just noticed the emotes being different and I wonder if the extra "r" wasn't added due to some limit on how many characters could be put on to the emote name
CHARLOTTE NOT HOLDING BACK
It's a shame such features are thrown onto community servers. Geahcord itself is so niche but I could never see it going public. Mainly because that'd mean every channel sans those labled NSFW would have the stubborn filter applied. And that's not even mentioning the potential bad actors that'd come in
^
Oh cool!
That's what I'd recommend just so you don't lose years of server history
You'd have to temporarily archive <#357682999300718592> to give the forums a test run
That's what I was thinking.
The talk of threads for <#357682999300718592> has been discussed before. I vaguely remember people mentioning threads are harder to moderate, thus it was a no go
Me neither. The one server I'm in uses them as a general support thing but yeah
Those new forum channels: What are your opinions? I don't think the server would benefit from one, as it's basically an entire channel devoted to threads, but I saw them on another server recently and wondered what y'all thought if you've seen them
I just think it'd be cool to have the bot or something have a poll system, but that works out just as well
Oh yeah!
I thought the Events thing would've been intriguing, but the ping is fine and I could totally see it working. Idk how they'd organize a poll.
Ahhh.
Cypher mentioned that once the Gear rewatch wraps up that <#371105434771390465> will have those groupwatch things again, so I'm wondering what y'all will do for it. Will they get a special role much like the anniversary rewatch has that lets Cypher ping people for it? I'd also be curious about how polls would be run, and if the "Events" feature Discord has will be used. I remember Lily White doing that for season 1 in the beginning, so I'm curious if they'll use the events feature again.
Yeah, they announced it and everyone naturally started banning the bot from their discords
(Before the NFT shit at least)
I remember on WEPcord we used that, though we also used cringe MEE6
Yeah
Aside fun commands
Carl is logging stuff iirc
With Carl and other bots having certain commands, I would think about having a channel for bot command use in the future. Thinking about this, however, the issue there would be activity that fluxuates. If not, I suppose bot command spam could be redirected to <#977744682035605514>
Probably someone accidentally moving them on mobile, cuz I know that happens a bit.
Uh oh, I noticed <#448237561085952001> above <#368973801561653253>
Like I said, I'll be limiting the images as per people's thoughts on the matter. I don't mind posting the cutscenes to go along with it, whatever lets people consume the game at the same pace I am. Y'all are great.
I think that's why I like <#977744682035605514> so much. I'm too shy to livestream things.
If not, I'll do what's suggested and post YouTube clips with bits of gameplay in between.
So, if it gets the mod's graces, I'll gladly continue my Xenosaga playthrough in a thread in <#977744682035605514>
Though I think the community would be trustworthy enough to have threads. In that case, I really wouldn't mind making one for Xenosaga 2 and 3
Threads have been suggested a few times, but mods say they're harder to moderate so that idea gets shuttered. And I could understand that.
I've just not been the best person here for awhile and I'm sorry.
Again, deeply sorry to those I have annoyed with this. When I begin Xenosaga 2 next week, I'll probably post the cutscenes from YouTube or something.
I guess this kinda thing was a long time coming. I wanted to share my experiences with games and the stories in them, but I am aware this kinda thing bloated the channel and scared people off.
I do feel bad that I have scared people away from posting in there, however.
I'm just not comfortable learning another platform when <#977744682035605514> acts as its own thing already, but I'll try cutting down on how many images I post.
It's a good meme!
The one with Hibiki walking through a Doom level
Oh hey Yui. I think I saw one of your Symphogear memes before!
Ooh that'd be cool to use them as stickers
My brain just has a spotty thing for consistency
<#1030482779588272178> could be 2k22 to be consistent with the archived channels I think
Shirabe in February, Kirika in April, Tsubasa in May, Kanade in July, etc.
Wow to think there's a Geah birthday to celebrate in like almost every month
Ahhh I forgot haha
Not icon, the banner
I thought Serena's birthday was next week? I thought the icon would have changed
I remembered last year we saw the Padorus make a brief return for the holiday season
Yeah
Really enjoyed that timeframe with <#658798535734591540> also opening on the 27th
So will padorus be returning for this year like they did last?
I think it'd come in handy for those interested but don't want to peek into the XDU channels or pins to see where to start. Having Elfnein pull a resource guide up right away would be pretty convenient imo since it allows anyone to poke around
With the Elfnein bot, could there be a command that lets her link the XDU information like that spreadsheet, translated events, etc.?
Ahhh, makes sense
So I maybe should've added Kanade or Chris *before* Maria? Hm...
Ahhh yeah, they were.
Query: How does the role thing work? I wanted to keep my Kanade and Chris roles, but I had to remove them to keep my Maria
<#977744682035605514> too is a catch-all channel
Alright, that's completely fair. Thanks for the insight, Melua! This server is tight knit and lax enough so I complete understand.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> True af
Moderation question: Have you considered a "Strike" system of sorts? Idk what y'all would think of that but I'd be curious to hear your thoughts. A 3-strike system is on another server I'm in so I'd be curious to hear your thoughts on it being implemented here maybe
Have a battle royale between the laughing emotes. <:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050> <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872> <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> <:MichaLaugh:816901827349184513> <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
But it's best to leave that body buried
You seem way more competent in owning a place than the guy I was thinking about.
Understood.
But who doesn't like dark humor?
I know I'm not any of those. Just sometimes a bit edgy
I guess combined with general negativity and letting go of the past being hard it gives you the cocktail of strangeness that is me
I admit I don't think before doing sometimes but that was the worst thing I've done
Nothing. A person here owns two servers and I was booted out of both for my dark sense of humor which is being suppressed
One user here has to do with that but I dunno. I figure it's time to stop thinking about it
I've been having a rough day honestly
Idk. Felt like a small talking point
Depends on my mood and what happened
Guess another thing I can say is I can get easily pissy
I'm just here for being a fan and all
Let's just say I have issues with like 2 people here but don't have the interest or want to talk about it
Eugh... someone I kind of have issues with is here. But no worries.
I'm 18, sometimes get super pissy about things, love video games and music, and adore animals. Manly dogs and cats.

I'm on AXZ but am probably going to love CV

They seem really nice, but were a bit too intimidated by the big member count
Hehe, what would ya know, I bumped into this person on another server for the anime Healer Girl

Welcome!
So if you're craving more Symphogear after XV, you can always dive into the translated stories of XDU or read many of the great fics in <#357682999300718592>
Np! Hey, I hear the stories from XDU, some of them at least, are a good read.
This includes memorias as well
No. It's just people translating the events from XDU so you can watch them on YouTube
There's a few people translating the stories from it most importantly.
No worries, you can find translations for XDU here on the server!
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Can I introduce you to the exclusive to the mobile game XDU character, Serena Cadenzavna Eve (Another)?
Ooh nice!
What seasons have you seen?
<#357682999300718592> Is a minefield. <#336310266654490624> could be one, but people do respect what season you're on and will keep quiet of things if you haven't seen them.

RIP Jake's old account
Welcome to ya. Have fun!
People are afraid of the gay, unbelievable...
I'm eager to rebuild that reputation I once had instead of continuing to burrow it by dwelling and treating people like shit
Cuz I felt my place here wasn't as prominent any more given I was treating people like shit left and right
That was my biggest fear yesterday and why I left for a bit
And I'd rather not do that, regardless of me having spent like 6 months being a dwelling asshole
Yep.
Don't think I'll be leaving again after this time. I just needed a night and a bit of a talk with a few friends before I decided to rejoin
The good thing about a community is that even if you do lose interest in the subject of said community, you've made enough friends that you're more there for them instead of whatever the server is for
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063> Yep
But hey, it happens
Idk why I needed specifically a night before I rejoined
So I getcha
I did the same thing yesterday
It's ok. <:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
Oh hey!
Thank you, Garie
I sure am!
Needed a moment to clear my head yesterday, became very wound up over something I shouldn't have
Thanks.
Welcome to ya!
Can we get much higher?
I didn't know you left. But I'm glad you're here again!
Or, welcome back

Welcome!
So I've heard. I recall checking it out once but it was **barren** as in, there were months old messages in some channels and it seemed dead the moment I joined. Contrast to when I joined Geahcord I was being welcomed right out the bat.
Welcome to the two new people!
Ahhh, thanks for the clarification
I've recently been playing through Final Fantasy X, that's been a good one <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Come to <#977744682035605514> where you can see people liveblog games and anime
"r/symphogear but with black jack and hookers"
It was made because the people on Valkcord weren't happy with how this server was running iirc
Place got nuked iirc
Oh right, remember hearing about that when the Shirabe manga was getting talked about
I've heard Valk ain't a great place at all
The fact you can find this server typing "Symphogear" into Discord's "Find server" thing is pretty cool though. Wonder how long it's kept that custom URL
Idk where but remember it
Hey wait I think I saw this name somewhere else before
Welcome!
You could say we're like a garden of sorts.

Finally reviewed DMC4
https://steamcommunity.com/id/DasAntihero01/recommended/329050/
<#371105434771390465> I'll kinda go into my thoughts
Yeah, that's what the video will cover aside from discussing the way it's ways of tackling touchy subject matters also wasn't the greatest.
I just finished writing all the way up to the beginning of the negatives.
Progress on the WEP review script is coming along
I'm planning on perhaps soon making a YT video on Wonder Egg. At least, I'll keep ya all updated when I begin on that.
How cute!
Went ahead and made another Steam review.
https://steamcommunity.com/id/DasAntihero01/recommended/1041720?snr=1_5_9__402
I love it

Oh hey I just saw that on Umacord!
Look out, we got a future IKEA salesman in here!
The Barraki are the coolest ones imo
I was born in 01, but remember somewhat growing up with them.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
OHHH RIGHT
Ok... somewhat.

Are they doing the Ultrakill pose?
Couldn't wait til 100%, so here's a review now.
https://steamcommunity.com/id/DasAntihero01/recommended/607080/
Will be down to read. Has a great premise.
It begins on my mom's birthday!
What a nice chameleon!
It's pretty solid. I like the silhouettes for the characters. Gives me a comic book vibe.
Good work! I like the details
Samus
That was a nice actiony introduction
I was going to give it a go and started writing a document laying the map out for it, but decided with how I have Geah fics I could work on, maybe this could finally be the year I scrap this long running thing
I'd still think about it, just not in the "will flesh out" way
I remember starting to think about it in 2016 then it grew over the years. In 2020 I eventually stopped and my thoughts on it grew less and less.
I'm finally piecing things together but I'm unsure if I should just let things stay in the past or actually finally commit
<:ChrisThink:724037732539695154>
>Tfw watching the Matrix gave me the motivation to revisit an old fanfic idea for a show and fandom I haven't cared about in years
Leaked image of new Symphogear season where Hibiki loses legs?!?!?
SO COOL!
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
For sure!
The way you draw eyes is great. Super super expressive!
Nice!
Oooh nice!
I'd sure love to be chased around by that for a level then fight it
Looks like it could be a boss battle in some 3D platformer action game
(Elf)nine the Phantom <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Very nice!
I only see a recent stream vid of around 2 hours
Don't really use Twitch too often but I'll watch
Sure thing!
üëÄ
üëÄ
Cool!
And I love it
Your art style is great. Gives me a Macromedia flash vibe
Yeah, I'd be down for a point and click too
Looks great!
We need canon HibiMiku with them both fighting in their Gears
After all, they are both fist using badasses with a dark haired loved one.
I like to imagine them working together
Very nice!
YESSSSS
Damn!

Gives me an early 2000s Nicktoon vibe. Similar to MLAATR

I'm contemplating writing an article about an album I'm passionate about given its 30th anniversary is a few months away

In a very cartoony fashion
We were around the door and when he let go of his hand, the mattress fell on top of his head
One of the few times I recall laughing at him being hit directly was when he was cleaning his bedroom, had the bed held up
Normally because he'd get hit at work since his job was sewer/wastewater treatment
Managed to learn it from my dad who did the same
I laugh off that sometimes when I get hurt.
Takes awhile to actually stop fully
True though
The wheezes are really worrying
For me, I know when to stop laughing if I'm getting asthma
Then I'll think about it as the day goes on and giggle
I have a habit of if I see something funny, initially I'm going to laugh my ass off about it for a long time.

Ohhh my girl
They make a lot of nice stuff. Though idk how to feel about the Chris/Genjuro stuff
I think my favorite "Safe" Symphogear artist is probably Lanlanlap.
Kaiyamon is great.
Cuuuute
I guess people wanted to crossover Rika with Yayaka given the similar style
Cloverworks
I love the fact WEP and Flip Flappers crossover art exists.
Yep!
Oh rad!
<@!222517038042710017> More BikkiBikki goodness
AU Serena do be a favorite though

Yeah.
I may be a Maria simp, but by golly do I like me some XDU Serena

https://twitter.com/htgn_mukuro/status/1394980222068527107?s=20
But I still like art
Hey, I don't know too many souls that draw MariChris
Their art style is nice though
They make KanaTsuba
POV: You are about to be taken to horny jail
BB is super cute

CUUUUUTE
And this artist's Pixiv name is SY
Oh wait, reverse image searching that first one reveals there is a Twitter account with the name "SY"

Ahhhh no. I just saw Maria and it reminded me of other Maria pics I saw
I think I've seen this artist before
Ooooh

Madoka Madripka



Saaame
I love any piece of Kanade art
Yoooooooo
It would be like that scene from Rebellion where Mami and Homura's bullets destroy everything
Chris as a doctor would be as low a survival rate as a Tsubasa concert.
"My prescription? Sword. And if that doesn't work, use more sword."

POV: You insulted Shirabe

That armored Maria is great.

I posted that image on the Uma server awhile ago. It's so cute!
Yeeeees
Gorgeous
<:ChrisHappy:660870796696223744>
Imo she has some of the best episodes in the series.
But in general Maria has some gorgeous art.

Also going to do what I can to avoid spoilers on WEPcord, given I mod it. Told the team that I was probably going to occasionally check in since people are gonna spoil the raws.
I'm excited, but cautious.
The last WEP episode will unfortunately not be subtitled today, though.

I love this one.

Saving Private Madoka

Kanade/Miku is just so "Ara ara" that it's insane
Loved her in Sonic Rush, wish she'd gotten a slightly better plotline in 06
God, I miss Blaze so much.
Yooooooooooooo

<@!195044406343106560>
She's essentially written as a "Waifu" character
Where I do like TsubaMari, it's really a shame that Chris's writing with pairings was slimmed down to either a third wheel for Miku and Hibiki, or just no one at all
Yeeeeeep
Bayonet is easily S tier
I could buy that
Ahhhhhhhhh
But now that opens up a lot more timeline fuckery that there already is
which I guess would explain her appearance in every game after
From what I read, apparently the Blaze in Generations is from Rush and not 06
It felt like all she was there for was to give Silver a deus ex machina so he didn't die. They wanted to do the "E-102 Gamma sacrifice" thing from Adventure, but she's living in Generations onwards since 06 retconned itself.
She was just there for Silver. Which I felt was a nice quality to her, as she is viewed as his only friend.

Damnit...
All that's missing is Hommiku

The appeal to drawing a canonically dead character is seeing what you can make them into with fanon.
Kanade got a well deserved expansion in XDU, same with Serena.

Shirase I normally think of Sora Yori
Did I really just call her Shirase lmao
If only for Eli to say her voice sounds kinda familiar
Shirabe and Eli meeting each other would be great

Lotsa good Kanade
It comes from a really good comp too
Thanks

Lmao
<@!222517038042710017>

I may be a Maria simp, but Kanade is just as good

Precious
Agreed
I guess if we're talking NSFW artists, Yoshi Tama and Amasora Taichi draw really good Chris' too
Then again this is just kinda my opinion. I do recall seeing Mel say something about them having odd takes.
How so?
Kaiyamon and Axia are great in that regard
Imo at least
Saying that as a compliment since Axia makes the best Chris art
Hina Yukitsuba is the Axia_chan of Hibiki art
Np!
<@!222517038042710017>
Pretty blade.


This reminds me of the comic with Chris and Kanade at the beach with Tsubasa, and Basa shows her Rooster bias

I've never thought of DMJii as a cat and dog before
Lovely.
Less about Chris singing and more about cool explosive shit
Chris concerts would just be a fireworks display

Why fuck with it that way?

Shiro Maekawa was in general really good writer, and it's genuinely a shame his last go around with writing in Sonic & The Black Knight went uncredited
Sure, it's a lot more serious than later titles. But it's done with the feel of a shonen anime that I can't say I dislike it.
I liked Adventure 2's storytelling.

No random order for any of these btw
Egg Dragoon, Viper, Hornet, Death Egg Robot, EGG-HVC-01 (Sonic CD), Big Arm, Egg Beetle, Nega Wisp Armor, Egg Emperor, and the secret final boss of Advance 2
Sure, it has a glowing obvious weakspot. But goddamn it looks so cool!
Your reminder that the Egg Dragoon is the coolest designed mech to come out of Unleashed

<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
I love this one
I like to think the writers were going to have a "Same age AU" with Maria and Serena being their older selves, but that'd mean having to completely rework how the Nephilim thing happened in the timeline
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Isn't she introduced in some XDU event where she's about the same age as prime Maria, but everyone just calls her a kid?

She's got wider hips than Hibiki according to B/W/H
If you played the Dark story in Adventure 2, he outright says it in the first cutscene
He's Eggman's grandfather

It fits her pretty well
Link with F.L.U.D.D. is too good

Cute!

I emulate SA2 Battle on Dolphin so no mods for me unfortunately.
If you want
This one takes all 3 stories and compiles them into a timeline all the way from Eggman's assault on Prison Island to find Shadow to the epic final battle with the Finalhazard
https://gamebanana.com/mods/48888
Actually, there is a mod you can get that ties the stories together into a timeline
Most people just start with Hero since it has all the threads that Dark fills
His entire character arc is such a dramatically heartfelt story in itself, and it always saddens me when I look at what happened to him after SA2
And Shadow is one of the major reasons why
I love SA2 to bits

"Hey, that's!"
"That blue hedgehog again, of all places..."

I'm sure Maria will take good care of him
The joke just lands perfectly
Well... to no one's surprise.
That's my favorite art lmao
I see
Honestly where's the EdgeMiku to match the EdgeBikki
Gamma I do also enjoy, though he's not as interesting as Gamma. Gamma was a story of freeing his enslaved friends from the badniks before sacrificing himself. Gamma just wants to kill Eggman for making him guard the Ultimate Lifeform for a long time.
Crazy Robo is a banger
The one detail I do admire about E-102 Gamma is their character theme. Everyone else just has a subtitle that describes their personality. It Doesn't Matter, Believe in Myself, etc. while Gamma is just "Theme of E-102 Gamma", representing how he's an emotionless robot.
<:kanahana4:580703777011531792>
I think Tails might be my favorite Sonic character. Gamma would be if he wasn't ya know... dead in the only game he has a canon appearance in.
Oh cute!
Dognana

<:MahiruOfCulture:633518942098423808>

Ah right my other favorite Sonic character might be Eggman himself. It was his writing in SA2 that specifically made me really like him. He can be really menacing if he's written right.

Look! They even got Gamma to wield a party popper!

It's a project a friend of mine did that combined the best fansubs to give the best Revue experience
You should watch it with Ripplesubs on Nyaa.
Yessss

Look at her she's so cute
I need Yuuki Yuuna honse
Zenno Rob Roy pls
There's so many honse in the mobile game I wish would get some screentime anime-wise or put into OVAs
I hope season 3 makes a tiny tiny nod to that original trailer for shiggles
I like how some look almost close to their final design
Yeah
Idk how my mind checked that off as boxing gloves
Goddamnit
Oh
Perhaps I do need glasses.
They... weren't?
Ara ara honse, Opera O with boxing gloves, ice skating horse girls kissing
The Uma Musume PV is something else
Does that make McQueen Sonic?
GolShi-Tails

<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>

Ygg thinks the art Albedo posted is too good and people should find it on their own



I sure would play Fate if it had honse

And that last pic os so good
Mermaid Serena is so pretty!
That Miku in the background is wonderful

Nandawa made this for Kanade's birthday this year

I'm still in the few that does like MariaChris at least, since they do have a few similarities
Yeah
Even without the OVAs, you were probably like, "Weren't you beating her ass just one season ago?"
Exactly.
Hey, Bayonet Charge was at least dope in GX. A season I'm pretty vocal about in saying was easily the weakest.
TsubaMari is good, I just feel that TsuChris is better since they've clearly shared their bonds in S1 and G, they've both gone through some heavy shit.
TsuChris is so good. If only Kaneko knew <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

Then CR pretty much held it back for a few years
They were just making something with the passion of wanting to make something
Exactly
It doesn't do too much to stand out but it's inoffensive.
Say we do get another season. Maybe the criticisms regarding the writing and characters might change. To me this show was too by the books for its own good.
Not at all worth the uproar most anti-SJW idiots throw at it.
To me it's an average show at best and at worst
<@!106866895076003840>

Those 2 have great art, though it's hard to deny that popularity makes them susceptible to weird/low quality art
I suppose she has such good art because her presence is so little in the anime. It just makes the quality a lot better than say Hibiki or Chris
Kanade has the best art.
Gosh this pic is cute

Are we gonna have to start using those now while the bot's down?
Yeah I know
Because I just viewed the original image on danbooru (for quality sake) and pasted here
Wait the bot did?

I'd unironically watch that
All of a sudden I'm imagining a 20+ year old magical girl that's struggling to pay her debt so she signs up to become one for the sake of reeling in dough
It's just so funny
I love the idea that like 15+ is the age most magical girls are old or retire

Sometimes I forget about things in GX outside of the Autoscorers and the final few episodes
Berserk Chris and Basa would be super neat to think about. Basa going so berserk she's almost Vergil-like while Chris just has a more chaotic form of Megadeth Party
God I just realized. Had Berserker Bikki not been done away with in G, if we got a Symphogear character action game that'd be a neat ass Devil Trigger substitute

There's plenty of top quality art from those artists
NIyun with Shirabe, SY with Maria
True as hell
Chris was pretty much everyone's favorite when I talked to them.
Oh yeah I can tell. I've been in this fandom for 2 years, but even before i joined I could tell
I find it amusing Chris is one of the characters with a folder to herself, and on its own she has 4.31GB whereas HibiMiku is the biggest "couple" folder
I might back that up to my laptop, since that's where I keep my anime screenshots and shit.
I have google's file explorer thing but even then the way they make it is odd.
True.
Well, it's not hurting anything I can tell you that much.
But I will prob back it up onto my HDD on my laptop
I'm the same person who watches anime on their phone 'cuz why not
What, you don't save fan art/screenshots/etc. there too?
That'd take awhile to download for sure.
9.19GB for group pics? I was glad that Maria & Serena were only 2GB on my phone
Oh yeah I should get those
I only downloaded the Maria/Serena one and got the 3 files last night. Perhaps it is time to give it another download just for sake of having gotten everything.
I downloaded it not even a day ago
Just today?
I remember owning it in some way. It couldn't have been the full game, since the only Mario sports game I remember owning was Toadstool Tour
I think I remember having the demo to that one as a kid
Axia good

Only real Maria change I was a little bummed out about was the swap from Gungnir Spear to Airgetalm. Maria's design in the Spear outfit looked awesome. The cape was the thing that sold it.
~~The AXZ outfit was perfection, why replace it?~~

Wait that was Sam not Charlotte
Charlotte beat me to it aaaaaa
According to gelbooru (I saw their HibiChris pic there), the artist is Claud (Potetetew)
It's even worse if the artist is specifically a Twitter artist, because they could post a pic then in under 24 hours they'll nuke it. And unless you downloaded it, no one else has it.
I'm actually glad Kerrik's collection has most of the art I've seen that's gotten deleted that I liked
I should start doing that
So I'm unsure about demon age. But half-demons like Dante and Vergil are treated with human age iirc
Trish was created by Mundus initially to lure Dante to him
In DMC1 Dante was confirmed to be 28
Dante was 19 in DMC3 iirc
Mid-40s from what I've looked up
Nico is hands down my favorite side character

Hina Yukitsuba knows how to make a good one!
With Kerrik's Maria collection I'll have a gold mine of pfps to swap through when I feel like it
~~Well I mean something was wrong with Tiger Maria if you knew the full image but I thought the top half was cute~~
Nothing was wrong with tiger Maria but I wanted something cute
Alright, I guess this is my pfp for now
That one's great
I mean... it's still a Cadenzavna Eve sister
"Mommaria Enjoyer" I say, having an AU Serena pfp
I adore Hina's HibiHibi stuff
Hina Yukitsuba art + this person's writing would make for a great combo
If we ever get XDU manga, I want this person to write/draw for it
It's a good read
https://dynasty-scans.com/chapters/kageri_hibimiku_omnibus
Because one Miku + both Bikkis sounds like great fan art material
I wish there was more than that one doujin with two Bikkis and two Mikus obsessing over them

Cute!

Just Big Rigs afaik
How many games let you cross the entire width of the observable universe in 160 picoseconds?

Big Rigs is at least stupid fun because driving backwards shatters what little game there is
At least he's not stuck in Big Rigs or Sonic 06

~~Sure does give me Pixiv first image safe, second image being lewd vibes~~
It always amazes me when I see a normally NSFW artist make something safe. It makes me think, "Wait you have it in you to make something not lewd. This would be nice to see more often."

I'm not exactly hating on it. The biggest issue I have with it is solely the lack of development.
Tsubasa/Chris is great since it's built off a villain-to-hero dynamic. Where I can't say they were pushing towards TsuChris in S1/G, you could really tell by AXZ/XV they *wanted* TsuMaria to be a thing. And in all honestly? Eh.
It's not because either character is bad or anything, they just feel lacking in development. Maria especially.
I mentioned it in <#336297808221044736> yesterday that Maria and Tsubasa are probably the one pairing of the main I've seen that I'm the least fond of.
Yay! People love TsuChris too!

Now that's adorable
Then I looked it up and to my surprise, it's from 04!
It reminded me of something from 1998
It reminds me of when I first saw Nanoha's OP (Didn't watch the actual anime)
Yeah, S1's visual direction is very reminiscent of an early 00s anime
I think the best thing about Geah is seeing how the art style continued to get cleaner and cleaner until you reached XV

I was just thinking of that one
YOOOOOOO
It's great.

I wish there was art for White Jungle or something since that's one of the other cool, intense Shadow moments
This one is really cool
I'm glad there's some really good recreations of scenes from Adventure 2 in fan art.
One of my favorite pieces of Sonic fan art



Their TsuChris is just so good
Atori's art is always great
Omg so true!

One thing I forgot to mention was Aoi Yuuki also voiced a character in Forces. She was one of the many voices for the Avatar.
<@!250295696714891285>
<@!379337518371307522>
The only memories I get looking at this pic are how much this level fucked me over with the rails. Not the hardest A rank, but definitely frustrating



Hibiki vs. Ver
https://fxtwitter.com/tracker_td/status/1089266496277229569?lang=en
Aside her voicing Sticks the Badger
This is even more funny considering Aoi Yuuki is a Sonic fan and said she loves Shadow
Holy crap thank you!
Please ping me if any of y'all have it
I just remembered that pic and thought it was super funny
Does anyone have that pic of Hibiki holding up Shadow the Hedgehog and saying "He was calling for you" or something talking to Maria?
Ngl I've always wanted to see more art of that specific pairing
Wow, it's cute to see Kanade, Maria, and Chris together
This means we need to see Ryuuko in Marin's uniform now
<@!441981795429384202> <@!551256807041925148>

<@!551256807041925148> Be prepared, I've got a huge sfw Maria dump approaching!

üò≥  (Vine boom sound effect)
Das?

I can imagine Chris hauling her out when she gets too drunk
Chris x Adult Serena üò≥
Each of them pushing right into her face
It's Chris surrounded by the main pairings
Chris gets the biggest harem
The girl who suffers the most gets the coolest, prettiest art
I love Tsubasa's artwork.
Angel!
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
The animation makes me think of GTA SA for some reason
üòî
I wish I wasn't

3_skip Don't mind me, just adding another Lily piece to my bottomless bookmark collection
True af
Hamter gets some good art like kitt
I can mostly agree with that
No worries! I think Maria posting has ended for now.
It's odd that it can't source all the images, but eh. This was all the ones in his collection I could find



I can help!
Aww.
This pic is super valuable from our ring pls don't steal
I've def mentioned him having the TsuMaria group chat before so it's def kinda known
~~Yep~~
TsuChris even
MariaChris>TsuMaria tbh
AGREED
Honestly not sure how much I should have disclosed group chat wise but I just remembered him mentioning a few things relating to how he organizes group chats
I think they just do the main pairings, not the ones like TsuChris. But the pairings part of his art collection might have some.
I get all the adult Serena I want with the Maria/Serena collection
Maria and Serena getting their own folder
Kanade and Serena don't reel in the art because of how much art they usually have. Though KanaTsuba is its own thing in Kerrik's collection
Kerrik came to me with the offer initially. So if you like a certain character enough, maybe he'll DM you and ask about it.
I know a member left awhile ago after they and I had a tiny drama, but they haven't claimed their space yet. Kerrik does these group chats for every character pairing sans Kanade and Serena I've been told.
You'd have to ask.
That's normally where Maria and Basa art throughout the week gets posted
Maybe you can ask Kerrik to join the TsuMaria group chat
ü§ù
I saw briefly in <#448237561085952001>
Oh crap
Yeah, suit Maria is one of the best things XV graced us with
Ok, just one more picture

We've reached peak culture
I'll change my primary pfp back eventually but I like this
Having him incarcerated means those chains are made of some kinda strong metal
Now I wonder how they got him in prison to begin with. Dude looks like he would have put up a huge struggle
Yep!
3_skip For an old man he do be swole ngl üò≥
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Hell, him being 100+ implies he was born in the 40s, so no doubt he was born during or near the end of WWII
Would love to hear what an old imperialist has seen since he lived that long
God even though he's a POS I think I'd have a talk with him of all Gear characters because he's ancient
Then again the playboy guy was old and he was still getting ladies while he was old
Fudou is like 100+ years old, what could he need ladies for?
As it displays it in full size
If you're copying them from Pixiv, please click/tap on the image

Also I found out MEGA lets you download the whole folder as a zip file, so eh... I've got my work sorted for me at least
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThWTOuiMV7M
Me when I see WinRAR installed on a PC:
Yeah. Idk why he likes WinRAR
Even though I use 7zip on the main PC
Yeah, for some reason
God, I could extract the Maria & Serena archive just fine on mobile
Wtf
>I try to download the archive
>Download KanadeBasa one
>Am using WinRAR since this is my older brother's old laptop and he had that installed
>I go to click on the first one because reasonably, that should've been the one that extracts the others
>"Archive corrupt"
Love it
But this is good too
TsubaMariaKanaChris is perfection
All it needs and Chris and it's perfection
CATS
Another bad thing about Twitter is sometimes artists post banger pics and they end up being deleted unless someone archives them. That's kinda what I like about Kerrik's Kollection. I can find some pics I liked that were up on Twitter one day, gone the next.
Sometimes I ponder why artists jut don't use Pixiv
But I don't wanna touch Twitter
I don't even use Twitter at all, but when I hear of an artist who specifically uses Twitter for their art dumping grounds, it saddens me 'cuz I miss out on bangers.
Guess that's the biggest plus to specific characters. Kanade exists in XDU, sure. But some Gear fans probably wouldn't bother with XDU since global died so quickly and they don't wanna read JP
Kanade getting some of the best art because there's so little of it
I could always use more rooster
Damn, now I'm tempted to download Kerrik's Kanade/Tsubs image collection
Genjuro can't stop them now
So cool!
Ignite Kanade!!
<@!551256807041925148> Not lewd, but Kanade training pics are good
First Kollection I've downloaded and easily the best.
Yep.
Ok, that's probably all I want to share for now.

BABY SORD




May as well share KanaTsuba at least
I think I should start a lewd dump maybe? Idk? But there's def plenty to share either way.

And yes, Kanade has drip.



I'm a Kanade, Maria, and Chris simp. Otherwise referred to as "Tsubasa without the suffering"


X-DRIVE KANADE AAAAAAAAAAAAAA




So I've got a lot for days!
Either way, with Kerrik's Kollection, I have over 930MB of Kanade things to post, and 417MB of the rooster and her sword together.
Shall I ping Kanade? Or do you think she'll see these all in the morning?




Yep!




Now I can post *all* the Rooster I desire

More than 2 hours later on my desktop cuz I guess Mega's download speeds are slow if I go for all the files at once, I finally have the KanaTsuba archive downloaded as a zip.
<@!428979121616322561> Good work!
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Hell, what the Bikki doing
What the Zenbu doing?
Except here I did admittedly dump more.
Check the other channel for some spicy rooster art if that's up your alley. I gave both channels good stuff
All the rooster!
Oh yeah before I head off, I figure it's appropriate to ping <@!384495616065273856>
A character who wasn't on-screen much, but fans regardless very well liked
Kanade could be described as an "Ensemble Darkhorse" by TVTropes
Glad that I have Kerrik's archive and can only pray that it gets updated so I can see even more.
Yeah, Kanade in general deserves all this good art
Oh hey I know them from the Animemes discord, StarCaliburn makes some cute stuff
It was so good going through Kerrik's folder 'cuz it's full of some pics I've seen and a plethora of awesome new ones.
Yeeeeeeeeeep
And I can cap this off with another <@!441981795429384202> <@!379337518371307522> and <@!728959474462621706> ping
Alright, I think that this is enough for right now. I hope Kanade likes all the art I've posted!



I'm sure it's there but my eyes aren't the best.
Yeah, sorry. I can't find much.











I can look through my KanaTsuba folder
"What? It needed a fish tank!"

"Being Meguca is suffering."
"Being Gear is suffering."

Def a lot of power tho tbf

HIBIMARIA AAAAAAA
I just go full monke mode seeing MariChris. It's definitely adorable.
I love MariChris!!!!
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
The real question we should be asking, however, is can we call Shirabe Shinyabe?
Yeahhhhh
Adult
The pic in the other channel, this time sourced
Lanlanlap is exceptional when it comes to art yeah. Though the Chris/Genjuro stuff is weird
Jaga makes cream of the crop cool art.
Ooh ooh, Nabe and Jaga
Visqi too yeah
I can def name plenty more. Kaiya and Axia make good stuff. If you did a Geah artist tier list thing I'd def try it ig
Kiraki, Funkysatou, Niyu, Lily White, uhh...
Can't wait for more birthday art for her this year
Kiraki always makes the best Gear art.
This pic makes me want to see Tsubasa cosplaying as Raiden in MGS4/Revengeance
~~Ah, so I was kind of right~~
Ohhh wait, is it like Hibiki and Miku?
I dunno. I haven't played XDU so uhhh
Btw Kerrik, what does "SUNSHINE" mean since I see "Normal" and "SUNSHINE"

DenGungnir <:waaaaaaaaaaa:350746642825347072>

Negresco do be one of my fav artists after all so of course I'd go a lil monke seeing a new pic

I woke up today and said "KOS-MOS making more Negresco", that's clearly a sign my sleep was a little fucked maybe
Negresco making more KOS-MOS

Ohhhhh

Does this mean Maria is the big sister to her petit counterpart?

Hina Yukitsuba
Yooooooooooooo
PRETTY
YESSSSS
Btw random question for <@!263983345669505025>: With how big the stash for art is, do you happen to use an external HDD or something to keep them safe?
I could prob want to write a MikuChris
Hell, if I manage to finish those *definitely* PG, family friendly fics featuring Kanade (at least the her, Maria, and Chris one is cute)
Mikuria sounds cute
KanaMaria is also very nice.
But I kind of like the idea of HibiMaria
For me it's MikuChris and MariaChris
What's a pairing you'd like to see more art of?

Not huge into their Chris x shota moon Hitler thing but the art is at least good looking

Deadlocked was fun, but it does wear itself a little thin since it's just the arena stuff from Going Commando & UYA. A fun spinoff to kill some time with.
They made Clank your mission man, he wasn't even on your back. Merc and Green were a little funny though (the two combat droids)

I like how Shirabe has the Maria plush
The rooster and her mighty harem
I see the KanaMaria too but wow
Yooo, KanaChris and KanaHibi

Look in the pins <:KanadeWink:690470895608791040>
I LOVE the style of this one
Another banger Ranea pic
BIKER JACKET KANADE AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Kanade playing instruments is something I didn't know I needed
Made by the wonderfully talented <@247701824335904770>
Do I love her? Perhaps. Do I love her more than Maria? Hm... hard question.




Kerrik's Kollection is a godsend


Need... More rooster art...



Ignite Kanade is the coolest

Nyanmaru's art never fails to put a smile on my face. It's so good

Jaga's Kanade art is the best btw
How can I resist posting her tho

I have to look at that twice lmao


I'd like to see Hina Yukitsuba also get time to shine as well since I'd like to see the two Bikkis hanging out
TRUE
They draw both so well
Jaga is top tier in the Hibiki and Kanade art department
What will these devious fiends get into?
I want an AU of Maria and Kanade raising a smol Hibiki
Of course I cannot resist
She's very pretty
~~Mommade Enjoyer arc when~~
I'm always a fan of Kanade posting
She's got:

A badass gear
A cool spear
Floofy hair
A fantastic personality
~~The 3rd biggest bust behind Maria and AU Serena~~
This server made me love Kanade more than I thought I ever would


Yes, it really is

Welp, I think it's time for my 3rd Rooster dump of the week, then! Too bad Discord appears to be having trouble loading files in on my end.

Did someone call for more Rooster?

Or Maria and Kanade are supervising
That person clearly trusts them
Figured I'd show the blade some love since I showed the Rooster love too

Hey, she'd make my dishes collage together to look like a Crane. I'd hire her again.




Holy fuck that's too funny
Kerrik named this folder "Mad Flatter"


Ok I guess exiting and starting up Discord again worked. Idk why it specifically chose to glitch out like that after updating but w/e


Why tf is Discord taking so long to load images from when I click "select file"





Sure thing!

Another pic by <@247701824335904770> that's just really good.

I love me some Uma Musume stuff, I just really wish they'd drop a new pic once in awhile. Or finish that one
<:BocchiHands:660933135050997781>
Too bad Niyun is stuck in the horse girl mines like most Gear artists
My Gear girl simping prob goes something along the lines of:

Maria>Kanade>AU Serena>Chris>Hibiki
My brain: "Write more with Akio and Serena"
Also my brain: "It's a one shot, get back to writing your WIP fic"
Yes
Then a day or so after finishing, I see this and am like "Oh my god someone had a similar idea"
It's funny because before I finished my AU Serena fic, I never saw this pic
I love this pic the most
This was the pic that convinced me that maybe Maria wasn't the only of the two worth simping over
I wish Niyun would've finished this. Adult Serena is so good aaaaaaaa


Yes
~~I like Adult Serena a lot more though~~
Serena üëÄ

Damn, I thought that was a cosplayer for a sec. The visual style looks almost real.
I know a friend that likes the Fate series, having read the VNs. They've said to just ignore the anime and read the VNs when I have the time or want to read 'em.
Ngl I was sorta unaware of Prilya until the XDU collab


How many times have y'all been over that with them?

I hate how inconsistent the bot is with that since I have seen JPGs send with the source before

S1 Chris design is dope
POV: I'm going to simp jail
I think she said something about being in her 30s? Mid-late idk
"That show is older than Mel"

Because it was moving in kB
Why tf does it take so long to download everything as a zip from MEGA? I downloaded the Chris collection from Kerrik's mega and it took from around 10AM to 12

G onwards does look really nice
Yeah, I guess I like it solely for the design. It's cool looking, but it's nice to see it get more refined.
Yeah she looks cute




Oh yeah this collection also has MY FAVORITE CHRIS OUTFIT




One other connection I can make JP voice-wise is Mughito being Drachma and Fudou, but he is always some old guy in video games and anime
An XDU Arcadia event would be funny specifically for Yui Horie voicing Serena and Fina
~~XDU Skies of Arcadia event when~~

MikuChris spinoff manga after the Shirabe one
Let's see. I have:

Chris (as her own folder)
Kanade & Tsubasa
Groups

I suppose HibiMiku and a redownload of Maria/Serena could complete things in terms of character art I'm interested in
I was peeping my folder for HibiMiku then remembered that's another Kerrik Kollection I have to download. But I'm fine enough with these random pairings


<@379337518371307522> Some KanaHibi too!




Is this enough? Idk




Of course this collection has HibiMiChris too

Ok prob not that one in this channel

One of the best Geah artists
The big dragon itself is neat though. I think my overall favorite dragon design from anything is the Panzer Dragoon series
Both
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I dig the dragon design
That's so cool!

A solo Gungnir vs. Gungnir Black battle would've been cool
What we needed more of in G honestly


<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Ngl I kind of wanna see art of Chris using her cowlick as a helicopter sorta thing like Rayman


"You're not Hibiki, please fuck off"

Which I find cute
There is a small, but cool amount of art for the two however
Or... ShemMiku beating the shit out of Maria
Behold, Mikuria!
Ikr

Ah wait nude Kanade in that one <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Lucky for you, this art folder has a collection of that too!

Gungnir trio pog

But I've got other projects to focus on so idk when I'll get to that
All this KanaMaria is giving me that old spark to write a lewd fic inspired by a certain KanaMaria pic
Ngl this reminds me of the KanaMaria wedding fic Sam wrote a bit
<@384495616065273856> <@782841825069236236>

At least the pics on their own are really cute. Kanade being a big sister figure first and foremost.

Cags and Chris and Cags and Maria get folders too, eh?
Get Kerrik's art collection. It's pinned, the "Groups" collection has all the art for whatever pairing you desire and more
~~As you can tell, I really love Maria and Chris together~~

So glad there's this much art of them together <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>

A bit surprising there isn't more, but it's cute to see those two pics
This folder has Kanade and her sister in there too
Oh look <@726218419749519400>

<@445783190976856065> Only two pics it seems
True
I was just surprised to know Kerrik compiled Maria/Ver

OOOOOOOOOOOH MY GOD THERE'S A DREI WING FOLDER
Ah yes, Spy x Family or whatever


Was nuts

Curse the tiny ass thumbnails on Windows sometimes lmao
"Tiki-san, these goggles ain't shit"

Oh look, Hibiki and Tiki art exists too!
Only in fan art can we see Vanessa and Chris side by side
I imagine it's a combination of skimming Pixiv and Twitter on top of scouting art that's posted here
<:kanahana2:273359134286544896>
Kerrik at least deserves a free McNuggie meal or something
... Or does he?
Kerrik doesn't compile these for nothing!
Be sure to check the pins!
Awww, what a cute young child and loving father. I hope she doesn't attend a catastrophic concert that splits the family apart due to her father's boss's daughter getting killed in it!
This folder also has Top Dad and Hibiki art, which is interesting
This one's a little funny
St. Germain and Miku? This archive has a lot of interesting groupings

<@263983345669505025> What does the "Other" folder contain? XDU characters and the like?

This folder does quench my thirst enough at least
Need... more... Thief Maria...
Manga gets adapted into anime, the anime is considered really good by fans of the manga
Hence why there's art of some of the characters together
Some of Genshin's VAs are also in SxF
**Symphogear G OP blares**
"There is 1 person in Ukraine named Maria Cadenzavna Eve"
The downside to some pictures is that they can be really good, but they're meant for a character's birthday, and sometimes there isn't a textless version of it
It's in August
Oh my god it is
Big Serena best Serena


Spear version too <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Y'all want some Gungnir Miku?
Her 2 GFs
Or it's Bikki doing gay stuff with Chris
She's probably looking at Hibiki again


As you should




<@456226577798135808>
Why does my keyboard usually add an extra s to the end of my sentences?
XV would be a bit more weighty in the sense that when Miku and Elfnein get captured, Miku is a way more valuable asset for Noble Red to have on their hands
Because the damning flaw of both seasons is that Miku isn't *that* in the picture for most of it, despite it being the main pairing
I like to imagine in the GX epilogue, just to be safe, she takes up being Elfnein's assistant. She wants to do it not just so she can be a little closer to Hibiki, but also be given more screentime
~~Is it fine if I accept that as canon~~
Yessssssss
That's so cool!
Just so Miku could potentially be more involved
Honestly that seems like one thing I would write into GX/AXZ or something
Elfnein's lab assistant
I'll try and dump my Miku folder later
Y'all ok with some track outfit Miku too?
A shame, it's such a cool concept
Sadly only two pics in that collection

Oh
I can look
Is Miku in a SONG outfit here?

<@250295696714891285>
Adult HibiMiku üëÄ
Super based
And KanaMaria
The SUNSHINE folder is where most of the pics I posted came from
Shall I continue my HibiHibi art compilation? Or do I look more into TsubaHibi since that has a normal and SUNSHINE folder
Reminds me of Charlotte's fic where Tsubasa is dense to the fact Chris is married to her
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
Oh no I moved a chair and the timeline looks like this now. Sorry everyone!


~~I totally saw Chris behind Tsubasa without anyone reminding me where she is~~
One of my fav AUs
**Makyuu Ichiaval intensifies**
True
~~Also why is Chris' detail of having an H-Cup needed~~
I love that comic
~~Oh god oh fuck Chris is a landlord~~

Chris as a mom is grand yeah
I posted the swimsuit one and the one with her being in Chris' undergear in <#336297808221044736>

Floof Chris should get some love tbh
Oh yeah, this is the peak


Small world!
This one is labeled "Zoe Wedding Comm"
This one is too cute! Kanade being on the cake is lovely




"You didn't try to kill that vampire woman. That takes some control, Tsubasa."
It's that "You didn't say poggers around my family, that takes some control" meme with Kanade
But that's probably because Kanade is there
I'm amazed Tsubasa hasn't tried killing Milaarc yet lol
Seems just about, yeah.
Probably Adam
Even the stroganettes get some love in that image. That lil Noise being there, too. Wonder who's in control of that
Everyone is here!

Glasses üëÄ

The upside to being an "obscure" character (read: A character who doesn't have much screentime but is more present in other media) is knowing that there won't be too much art, so you're given a lot more quality.
I find it funny before this server I kinda wasn't huge into Kanade, then discovered her Pixiv tag and really fell in love afterward
<a:APetForKanade:753351080133263540>
Be you a guy, girl, or someone who doesn't identify, Kanade appeals to everyone

Right
I just want to post the art I like from the collection now that I have a shitton of it
Yeah whatever, get off my ass <:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
"She's meant to sleep in the middle between both of us, Hibiki..."
"Me, my girlfriend, and her gigantic plushie that eats our spaghetti and calls us a baka."
This one always amuses me

Though I'm a fluff/romance writer, these pics make me wanna write a short story that's just the both of them fighting off Noise together or something

I just love seeing them both in their gears looking to kick some ass

Once I finish my Kanade/Maria/Chris fluff fic and my upcoming Tsubasa birthday fic, I might put a bit of time into giving a Gungnir family AU a fic. Albeit there won't be any Noise or stuff to worry about. Just fun for everyone!
Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
Absolutely.
Ohhh, the want to write a comfy AU with these three.
THE TRIO!
KanaTsuba my beloved

People on the server would be spending terrible amounts of money by god
Need more glasses Chris <:waaaaaaaaaaa:350746642825347072>
Honestly why tf isn't there more art of Chris wearing glasses?
And another
<@238855496797257729> Ty for reminding me I have Chris cosplaying as her
>Stares at my pile of unwritten ideas in my head
>**Kitchen Nightmares sound effect.mp3**
I can imagine Maria still having that lack of confidence in spots, i.e. she seductively gives Tsubs a peck on the cheek during one of their fights, then she's like "Oh my god oh my god I'm gay for the lady I'm supposed to be fighting"
Tsubasa can't stop repeating her first arc while Maria squanders any potential ones she has.
It's cute, but you have two very underdeveloped characters that I feel really divisive over it
Tsubasa/Maria is so shoehorned into shit since GX and I honestly think that it's a pairing I've grown to be mixed on myself
She could start to be seen as a rival who does know Tsubasa's strengths and weaknesses, but when you reach GX/AXZ when the girls get brought together, it's like a playful rivalry
Probably? I dunno.
Though tbh the one aspect I would rewrite with G is how little Maria is involved past the first few episodes
Damn, now I wanna see G rewritten despite it being my favorite season
**DESIRE**
Want...
Need...

Kerrik does snag plenty of art a good percent of the time
ShemEdgeBikki sounds kind of cool

Tonee draws a lot of Mordred art

The proper term I've heard works better over "harem" is something like "polycule" or something along those lines.
~~True~~
Implying Chris would ever do idol stuff unless she was Christina
So wait, if we have Chris into the mix, would it be Eir Wing?
Mythra's good too, but I mean... I guess if Kanade is anything to go by, redheads do something for me

KanaHibi art!
Damn, that's right.
Tsubasa repeats the same arc for most of her seasons, and Maria gets very little fleshing out. Though that's a damning flaw of the FIS in general.
I can't really root for Basa and Maria as much as I thought since where I do like Maria and I do like Basa, they both unfortunately aren't as developed. It just felt like the anime stuck them together.
TsuMaria is good, I'm just a lot more fond of the other two pairings
KanaMaria>MariaChris>TsuMaria imo
||Kanade because KanaMaria is a lot more based||
~~Not me unfortunately~~

I just woke up so maybe I was reading that wrongly
Oh yeah she is

Chris is like an aggressive Miku of sorts
HibiChris is one of my fav random pairings
Then I vaguely remember around the time I came back here I did
I just saw "Throwback" and was like "Oh wait did I ever use that as a pfp"
The GX one
Ah yeah it is
It'd just be a cute pairing since Chris is already pretty flustered by even the slightest amount of romance. So her being with Kanade is fun chemistry.
Kanade/Chris is fun since you have someone teasing a blushing tsundere
I love both Tsubasa/Chris and Kanade/Basa
TsuChris = KanaTsu>KanaChris

A living one might I add
I think Airgetalm in terms of design is fine? But what makes Gungnir Black cool is outside of the cape is it being a Gungnir wielder that uses the spear
GONK!

Always have that problem
Sorry for miscommunicating I suppose
I was just saying it's nice to refine the work
There is no problem.
I think it's great to refine your older works to match with your new stuff
Redrawing an old piece isn't what I'm complaining about anyway
Yeah
Yep
It's a really good birthday pic, but it just feels like they're continuing to modify a single piece in the same style.
Makes me think of the FunkySatou Kanade pic
Crap I was just about to ping her
I've been told Serena being what she was is pretty much a push for Maria. There wasn't much need for fleshing her out given she was meant to be a base for Maria.
But I see where you're coming from
~~That went straight to her AU self's chest~~
~~I mean, Kanade got about the same bit of development but look at her.~~
Wish there was more, but the amount of art I have already does suffice
There's so little AU Serena stuff sadly

Also yes, Nihilus is one of the coolest Sith Lords
Yeah it's one of the cooler games if you're looking for a philosophical take on Star Wars
~~So yes, he and Darth Maul would get along really well~~
He is so angry he can just get back up and fight again.
Darth Sion in KOTOR 2's lore was so resistant to pain given he fought in a great Sith War that, when he was eventually struck down by a Jedi, he just got back up and killed it.
If his anger would allow it
I was looking for Lego KOTOR stuff and stumbled across one of my favorite Sith lords as a minifigure

Looks very pretty

The same person that made the sweaty Chris pic I think
Oh hey I know that art style
It was that seared into my head, I love it
On rewatch? I was absolutely full stop not taking a screenshot.
It was a scene that, when I first watched G I was absolutely in love with

But knowing how Twitter is, telling them to have a simple "guest mode" where you can't view likes or something but can view other parts of the site without a login would be great
It'd be better if people could just view media without having to sign in or something
Yeah, and I don't even *use* the platform
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
I don't understand the line of thinking in that regard
Twitter artists wake up one day and are like "Hmm, time to delete half my tweets"
Oh yeah true
Figured I'd just post the art because I know sometimes Twitter artists delete their pics

B/W/H chart exists for the main Gears
Yes
Yet from what I've heard on this topic is that Chris' are only big as compensation for her height or something
I like to imagine Negresco only draws Maria's big because her bust is 96cm, which is like 6cm larger than Chris'
^
Negresco is an H-artist, so it's probably the boobs
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I'll say it once, I'll say it again:

Negresco makes the best Maria art hands down

Hearing about how Chris is developed does at least sadden me. I love the character but I'm sad that she's pretty much the face of most merch.
But genuinely speaking I do believe Chris had the best character development of the main 6.

Not to get all gloomy and sad, I just loved that lil rascal.
Sebastian, my childhood cat, was one of the best pets I ever had. He passed away in 2016, around the same time Munch came around.
I really wish I had another bicolor cat.
As much as I love Munch, I do prefer cats.

I remember never finishing Prime 1 or 2 as a kid. Hell, when I even got them for my birthday alongside a new GC in 2013? 12-year-old me still didn't finish Prime 1 or 2.
It's from the final final Prime 2 battle
Yeah, Dark Samus
Wait I recognize a few of these. Didn't someone use a few of these as a pfp before?
AMAZING

Everyone loves a good old scientist messed up on one front and their experiment goes different from intended plot.
One of Elfnein's experiments because let's rely on tropes slightly

Too bad he's not as useful in-game
Love how absolutely **feral** Jak looks here

Without a bird to power him of course.
I like to imagine for exploring Adventure Fields and the likes with him that Tails just rebuilt him.

It's just generic because it reflects how he's a machine with no personality.
His theme song has no subtitle attached to it.

Hello nurse!
That's a great Mash!
I'd watch a spinoff of just animated radio skits. Yeah I'm aware of the YouTube vids.
Bless the Symphogear radio skits for giving us Chris and Miku content while also being super funny
Ahhh
Oh?
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Hibiki can come along in spirit ig
MikuChris was one of the best things from S1
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
I'm glad I kind of dived more into alternate shipping territory in that regard, then. Stuff like MariChris and the likes
Truuuue
AXZ and XV do a huge job at pushing TsubaMari and it makes me feel sad Chris was just... there...
Yep.
I just don't believe it as hard as I do TsuChris <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
My issue with TsuMaria is more that the pairing itself isn't as believable as TsuChris. With TsuChris we had that bit of chemistry there in G and a tad bit of GX. But there was an obvious push towards TsuMaria because we have to make Chris her own thing. Big booby marketable waifu amirite?
~~We could just revive Kanade lmao~~
~~Damnit, good catch. Uh...~~
~~Shoutout to TsuChris for being more based than TsubaMari~~



SY's art is just the best, prettiest Maria content imaginable

Someone drew OVA Serena, that's neat

Hell, there's even a hint of older Serena in here too!
I know I normally don't dive into the Serena folder outside of Adult/Parallel but got curious and wanted to see some cute stuff

Guess we can move this to <#336310266654490624>
G introduced us to the FIS while expanding on already established characters. The next logical step would've been making GX a season that tries to flesh out FIS. But that's where I feel Symphogear starts falling on its ass.
The problem with GX and AXZ specifically in my eyes was more on the fact they didn't serve to develop the characters as well as G did
<:ChrisMunch:688191202973319198>
One gripe I do still have with it is the "Oops! All Cliffhangers!" thing it normally goes for
G is like the peak of things for me outside of the kinda stupid plot. Maria bias aside I was a fan of the whole "Team of good vs. team of evil" thing it went for combined with how it did mostly work off S1's ambitions

I feel as if you're getting your money's worth. But I can imagine the price may as well drop to $20 in the next few years. Seems like it'd be better there.
For $30 you're getting 8 or more hours of cute, fun content. Ntm if you're an achievement person like I am (though, I'm just going for them cuz they're all easy from what I read)
I think it kind of is? Could be a lot cheaper, though. I agree.

I think I vaguely remember watching the first few TTGL episodes
I spoiled myself on what happens with Planescape Torment and still felt the ending hit the same.
But I know that usually doesn't deter me from finishing something.
Too bad I've already seen the biggest spoilers
So one of these days
But it is one of those essential mecha anime
Haven't watched TTGL myself yet
CUTE!

Yep. I've been leaning on guides with JRPGs since Xenosaga 1.
Kanade and Maria's birthdays are also so close together, so I get back to back top tier art

~~I still stand by AXZ needing to be about FIS instead of Hibiki~~
Very fair and very valid point.
Then again, what FIS member was?
Huh. That's a very fair point, even if I think Maria isn't as developed.
It's uh... something.
A common word to describe XV would be bloated. You've got Noble Red doing terrorist stuff, Tsubasa having her five bajillionth mental breakdown, Maria just existing, Miku getting taken by NR and turned into a vessel for Shem-Ha.
XV's built off a rough foundation. We spent two seasons where Hibiki remained the focus, so the characters were hollow thanks to the lack of focus. FIS could've benefited from AXZ being a season focused on them, what with how the mini-arcs in GX weren't that satisfying.
I remember my harsh review of GX back when I had a Reddit account was definitely the most negatively received of the bunch.

Yeah. It's just a nice lil thing to see characters you like looking snazzy
That's not to sound weird, I just like the aesthetic that comes from it knowing these characters usually don't wear casual clothes and wear armor or something
Characters in general, even
I love seeing game characters in casual clothes

Having your health drain like mad would've sure gotten a lot of salt
That thing was a pain in the ass with the dark suit
The thought of fighting Boost Guardian but using the default morph suit sends shivers down my spine
I remember when we got it for Christmas years prior to me getting it as a bday gift in 2013, but it sadly broke because someone stepped on it. We didn't play the story, it was just the multiplayer back then
Fuck that thing, I remember it being my first big roadblock playing it years ago
It was unfortunately Christmas rushed, which you can see with how bosses like Boost Guardian are hair-pullingly frustrating
It's pretty solid, yeah
I was so close to fighting Quadraxis, too. A boss I've always wanted to battle cuz the design is so cool

It forgets to do things with the FIS girls outside of relatively small arcs
Which is why I dislike GX as much as I do
It's a crying shame there was no real expanding FIS despite the characters sorely needing it

I'm just so frustrated rn
Because I like sharing art in general regardless of it being already posted
The latter option is kinda hit or miss. Having someone post art somewhere else and being told, "Hey that one was already posted!" Kinda frustrates me
Also smh why didn't Lily ping me for the cute Bikki art
I'm just annoyed since I really wanna share art but it seems like everyone else gets to it before me
Idk
Back off, Charlotte.
I'm just so frustrated because I want to try and provide art but I can't
Goddamnit

With Pixiv, I notice most illustrations last a longer time
As a PIxiv-only person, getting to see art that's also on Twitter get posted to Pixiv is a huge plus, as you never know if the artist will delete their artwork, private their account, etc.
It is nice actually getting to repost the art too, now that I think about it.
Yesss, I love it.
This one is real pretty!

The more I think about it, the more I realize they really *were* foreshadowing KOS-MOS and chaos had a lot in common. The scene when KOS-MOS is sleeping in the maintenance room of the Elsa, that one double attack animation with them dancing in Episode 2

Hey, whatever keeps ya in your comfort zone. I'd love to see your fic ideas.
Awww.
Given they release monthly and give you 6 pages to write whatever you want, it's always nice to check <#357682999300718592> and see a new work from a mystery author. Usually people give you advice too.
Hey, maybe you could start writing prompts to improve your style
So many good fics I can't wait to dive into
Charlotte's Maria/Chris fluff one and Sam's KanaMaria wedding one <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I don't read too many fics outside of the prompts here and the occasional AO3 thing that does pique my interest, like for certain character pairings
But oh man will I be reading that
I'm a bit shocked I've never read My Sunshine or other big fics, though I mean... me and reading usually takes awhile since I have that odd amount of attention compared to like, watching anime or playing games
42 chapters though. Whoa.
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
I generally stay away from suffering stuff since I just enjoy fluff and other things, buuuuuut I wouldn't mind actually reading My Sunshine. Knowing full and well it is full of suffering.
There's so many Geah fics I haven't gotten around to read, but I am actually reading Ten and Voy's fic.
Amazingly
I have not read that one yet
MY SUNSHINE
OH
I smell a better use of the KaijuBikki stupidity that AXZ had in its final stretch

Always a good day when there's new Cags art
I love Episode 3, just pretty sad it never got the fleshing out it deserved.
Rather formulaic.
Chapter 9 in the beginning was mainly Shion and co. going around Michtam and bumping into the E.S. piloted by Pellegri, Richard and Hermann, etc.
You don't even fight it as that commenter says. Would've been cool as a boss battle tbh. But we all know Episode 3's budgeting was a little... something...
This just made me realize how little Kevin's mech appeared in the trilogy.

Itachi is up there as Naruto's best character overall in my eyes.

Please specify what Serena it really is next time because you threw me for a loop. Remember, the AU Serena I like *isn't* the one you pinged me for.
Since it wasn't the Serena I thought it was
Very disappointed in the ping

According to the 10 years of Oddworld artbook released in 04, Munch was initially going to have an alter ego that'd shift dependent on what happened during gameplay. So he could hulk out any time he was pissed.
Munch's Oddysee is the one game where there's just a shitton of scrapped content

Those are two I can think of at the moment
The more I think about it, the more Symphogear and Xenosaga have some intriguing connections:

- Gnosis and Noise are dangerous to people who don't possess the means to deal with them, Gnosis being invulnerable unless someone uses the Hlibert Effect. They also turn people into salt where Noise turn them to dust
- Shittons of religious imagery, though Xenosaga goes full throttle on it
Huge fan of the eye thing. So cool of them to add it to her V4 appearance when she's doing the Hilbert Effect!

X-Buster is one of the most hype moments of the game, just that cutscene it happens in is so hype. Episode 3's variant, specifically when Shion is in E.S. Dinah, is also cool.
https://youtu.be/q5kWPMmKTpA?t=37
KOS-MOS has a lot of heavy hitter weapons, as does Chris. But I wonder what wins: X-Buster or Chris' sniper rifle shot from XV?
KOS-MOS and Chris could genuinely have a test of each other's weapons thinking about it.
If I could, I'd love to commission Chris cosplaying as KOS-MOS. Maybe one of these days.

Her moments with Ziggy during Episode 1 are definitely highlights, given she does help him feel more human when he sees himself as a cold, calculated cyborg.

Tsubasa being with all 3 is my favorite kind of art.
Yeah... Even then I like the other pairings for Tsubasa a lot more. KanaTsuba and TsuChris are so cute!
That too!
No matter the girl

So whenever I do post art that's normally why I get angry if I see someone already posted it, because I think people are going to call me out on reposting it
I guess to me it's just annoying since sometimes I think people are gonna be like "Oh nice repost bro" or something, which gets on my nerves because I just wanna post a pic I found and wanted to share.
I get it, art reposting happens a lot
Friday.
Even then I was just so excited to see a DenGungnir pic and immediately post it, only to see someone posted it *literally* the 2 messages above me

Gungir Miku's an interesting thought, what can I say?










Here, have a cool Maria
TMI...

S1 really did a lot for Hibiki, Tsubasa, and Chris. But Chris' arc is written so neatly it's understandable why she comes out swinging as the most beloved character.
Chris is really cool, though I'm admittedly more interested in Hibiki of the OG3 because she's a lovable goofball that punches things
Chris' arc during S1 is so well handled that I really enjoyed her no matter how she was written.
Nehustan is also really dope
Eye-melting white be damned
I kinda liked it

Gungnir was cool but it's miles better in G, I really like the scarves.
Rewatching S1 I was pretty fond of Ichiaval, or should I say, Ichi-Bal's, design there.
Simple design, yet very clean.

The games are built to be amazingly replayable and practice heavy
Mood. Though the fun comes from learning enemy patterns and eventually styling because of it.
Apparently not too many people at first liked him in DMC4 for some reason? I didn't mind him too much honestly.
Nero's the greatest, I love him
Maybe for the hell of it bring Lucia back because she was cool I guess. Wouldn't mind if DMC5 was the end of the series, but it's clear if they're going to have it continue that Nero would be handed the mantle.
Gunning for Nero being the MC, but having playable Lady and Trish again would be nice.

If you click on an art piece on Pixiv, you're getting it in full resolution. It all depends on if you download the image or not, but usually copying and pasting *does* add MB to the image iirc

Big fan of Suitbasa personally.
I only now realize me reacting with <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> is a little funny in hindsight, given Kirika and Dia share the same voice actress

Really like the flashy poses for each character
I know, the gauntlets are meant to combine together to form a spear, but it'd be cool if there was some variant of Gungnir that allows for that dual-style combat
Honestly? I'd be down if there was a hybrid Hibiki where she fights with both a spear and a fist, but she finds some way to use the fist in one hand and spear in the other.

I understand. I'm not one to block people though.
True. Just be prepared to forgive me if that comes up
Let's just say if I do see that guy again I will have very little nice to say. But I'll respect your wishes and just keep it quiet
I understand
I'm going to change the way I act and I apologize for the not so great introduction
I understand
Sorry. I have a form of it myself so I really shouldn't be calling anyone it
But whatever I'm planning on moving on
Having him do that after I tried hard to suppress my feelings but failing kills me
Kind of pissed but mostly happy
Then the autist decides after I post a dark meme that it's a bridge too far and gives me the boot there. Now here I am
I kept bitching about it to the server owner when I got my first boot and I tried my hardest to keep calm
Someone I liked gave me a block and I made a low blow
Everything was mostly ok until early April.
I had a sense of paranoia that mods on that server were beginning to dislike me. Then I quelled that fear after a while
Needless to say I didn't act up again... until I did
Said anger continued until my first mute.
I figured it couldn't hurt to be there. Enter a few months in and I get pissed. A user there under an NSFW channel blocked me and I called them out for it. Needless to say it was foolish... then another user did it. And I lost it.
Didn't think too much on it first but loved it because it's the anime that got me into anime
To give ya a preview... it all started months ago in November when I saw Konosuba had a server.
But that's something small to look forward to I guess
Let's just say for clarity's sake I'm not mentioning anyone
I guess tomorrow I'll be able to bitch about my past and talk a bit in depth
That spinner lands on everything knowing him
And I put most of my things on a 1tb drive with the SSD being for system updates
But then my solid state drive filled to just MB
It was working fine before they decided to update it
... So Windows 10 is destroying my new laptop
It's hit one server I'm in so far

H0nde is going around and trying to enter plenty of servers.

Aged like wine for sure.


The dentist gave me these stitches that will dissolve after awhile, meaning I don't have to go in for getting them out.
So I've been dealing with wisdom teeth removal oddly well the past few days.
Quick, someone tell Tim Curry's Red Alert character that space, in fact, is not safe from capitalism!
That's weird. You should mention it's condition and say that a new one's needed.
I would consider discarding it.
^
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Just know if you do transition, I've got your back. I'm sure plenty of people here do.
I think you're a pretty chill person overall.
That sucks.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Just a day in and I'm pretty happy getting to know everyone - at least the people I don't already know.
Man, the past year was an odd time for me personally. A lot of things happened to my mentalities and everything, and I'm in all just really glad I'm here.
So I'd turn off DMs from a server.
I imagine that the bots have some sort of payload where someone gets DMed at random with information.
Oh, I guess the Wonder Egg server mods are already talking about it in a network for other anime servers we're apart of.
I should bring this up with my other buddies on WEPcord
At this point I'd probably close out invites *just* to be safe.
Huh.
The former is especially worrying since I have no immunity to airborne diseases.
Once it started becoming widespread we pretty much cancelled anything since I happen to have a heart condition and asthma, so mom got really worried.
We were going to get them removed last year before the pandemic happened
Iirc it was one tooth with a few extras since they grew sideways
Anything with small chunks in it I have to rinse my mouth out with saltwater, but other than that it's pretty pleasant.
At this point I can actually eat things like french fries, but they have to be soft.
I've been doing far better this week with my wisdom tooth removal.
Yep.
So you're pretty much just in time to watch the ending.
The Wonder Egg special is releasing this month, too!
It's a great anime. It's later half does go in a direction that's a bit strange, but it is a pretty solid anime.
It used to be "Whacky Woohoo Egg Man" because Devil May Cry, but then another mod named himself "Setsuna Simp" after saying that was his favorite Love Live girl. Being a Gear fan, I figured I'd just go with "Maria Cadenzavna Eve Simp" since mods/admins simping for a certain character was a running joke for a time.
This is what I wrote when we said anyone can chat about it in the general chat for Wonder Egg
I recall when episode 10 aired that the discussion part of the server was a trans/homophobic minefield.
Kaoru for reference
Yeah. How can someone *not* see the trans colors on Kaoru's jacket?
Yeah. Then there's Momoe being insecure about her masculine appearance.
Makes me wonder if they paid attention during the show, given the themes.
Some person on the Wonder Egg server I mod said that they were disgusted with the fact our icon had the pride flag overlay on it.
Good luck.
Hopefully it goes through the second time, that money is really vital.
Not sure about the European government and "wrong boxes", but here they just submitted the info another time and it worked.
Oh that happened with me.
I recall when we did my sign up for disability they tested what I could and couldn't do before mom and I filled out the paperwork together.
If you could, I would ask if you could be tested IRL.
Oops.
I meant cursive
Writing on it's own is already hard. Curses just turn into some alien language looking thing.

We've a lot in common.

Where I have a say in things, she happens to help out with a lot of the medical work.
I just know about it since my mom happens to have a firm grip around that info for me
I'm sure that works the same in Ireland.
Sorry I'm not the best at structuring sentences properly...
It's saying that if you are living with your parents at the age of 18, most people you talk to about adult stuff like medical or legal information have to get your permission to discuss things with your parents.
Wtf
I'm sure it's the same in Ireland.
By 18 here in the states if you have your guardian help out with things, the people you call up have to get your permission to speak with them.
It'll be alright.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Honestly I think that should be taken away if it wasn't already.
The fact they're Apple certified too.
The fact the technicians did this in the first place is disgusting.

Tbh I don't really take Ben or Daily Wire seriously.
The only time I see them *really* memed is just Ben Shapiro.
Apparently they're now just wanting to invest in making TV series and movies.
Yeah they are.
I totally forgot they were making movies.
>The Daily Wire
I think that they're also trying to make a school shooting up the same way they "found footage" films like Blair Witch and Cloverfield were popular. Because they were from the prespective of one or certain people.

If anything, that's gonna stir up a lot of shit.
<:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
They said they'd stop numbering Windows after 10.
Yeah.
Also Windows 11 strikes me as curious. I thought they were going to stop the number naming scheme after 10.
Not sure what their next move will be. I am glad that they're effectively axing windows versions on the 10 year mark instead of choosing to discontinue them when they feel like it.

Can say that Windows 10 is pretty alright now though I agree.

Woke up at like 6 this morning and my mouth was dry as hell. Hoping that the second shot is nothing more than just the occasional sore arm + dry mouth.
The moment I saw Hero Hei, their argument lost all credibility to me.
Mom was very concerned when news about it made the rounds last year since I happen to have asthma and a heart condition that's vulnerable to airborne diseases.
I do stay inside normally, so I think I won't have any issues.

"Person says something controversial about anime that us based cool people like and gets DESTROYED by twitter bros!"
I've always called Hero Hei "Animetube herpes"

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-57624942
Sad, but true.
True.
Atm we're at the point of going to plan B and asking Discord directly for the other admin to have ownership, as the owner crossed the line the moment they kicked the other admin.
I'm skipping over details just to be brief, really. Atm people on the server have not much of a clue about it.
There was a timeframe where we were left vulnerable since everyone's mod/admin powers got stripped for a good hour or two, then we were given them back.
Where we thought this was gonna go over alright and they'd listen, one of the two admins (there was three) got demoted, then eventually kicked.
In summary:

- We staged a way to make ends meet initially, where we wrote a letter to the owner about our concerns with them not being active, not meeting deadlines for certain things, etc.
At least, behind the scenes.
There's some drama afoot on the Wonder Egg server I help moderate.
It's a power fantasy to the worst degree.
I fuckin' hate the police.

I just know that the UK has a ton of cases compared to other parts of Europe
I'm not sure
Considering the riot footage I've seen and knowing how the UK is a COVID hotspot, I wonder how many people are gonna walk out of this infected
Just unsure as to when it will happen.
Death is just an inevitable thing we all come to accept will happen someday.
I treasure you, hell, a lot of people as good friends.
But it's best to just live with now.
Sometimes thinking about them opens up a well of interesting conversation.
In general it's best to just live in the now and not think about these sorta things I guess.
^
Reality is often cruel, and sometimes we accept this.
Even if those people you know one day vanish, you'll at least be happy you knew them.
The best thing about being a human is knowing others struggle.
Be it in general, in the moment, anything
The best thing about living is that... well... you're living.
It is a scary thought
I mean
I'm not sure if I should regret saying that or not
Hugs for both of ya
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Also the fact people have become so reliant on the internet as a new means to communicate
Worst in the way people are influenced by or use it
Best given the fact it's a new means to communicate
The internet is imo the best and worst creation of mankind
Tbh it's not like that's going to happen now
For now, just be happy you know them. Live with now.
Those you know, even the ones close to you will drift away slowly.

I'm pretty left myself, sorry if that shows a tiny bit.
Even if it's... ya know, the far right.
Blaming a political spectrum for your wrongs is probably the worst copout imaginable
Then they go and say "Oh, the far right was coming after them"
What the fuck?
It had taken me awhile to break out of that mold and see beyond, but now I feel satisfied.
In the last year, I've realized I am far more than the anger-ridden person I once thought I was. The years prior felt like personal demons were somewhat crawling up beyond me, it's talons beginning to slowly sink in. Then last year, I just about let that hate ridden creature swallow me whole for awhile.
I fell into a lot of self-made holes of anger and general depression last year, and this year's been a lot better. I've begun to mend old wounds and make new friends through odds I thought would've been impossible.
Occasional reminder I love y'all and appreciate how much better things have gotten. Given how last year was me at my lowest, this year has been far, far better.
Boris will be Boris.
Actually is a fairly interesting - and saddening read
Oh, this is what I was referring to btw
Well shit, I know what I'm selling since I happen to have it with the manual and map
Oh wait, Skyrim *on* Xbox 360 for $600
That's pure insanity.
Didn't know about Skyrim and an Xbox 360 being sold for $600
Oh yeah dad was just telling me about the Mario 64 thing
Finally

Yeah. I'm very curious about the Bi spectrum as a whole
Really conflicted atm
But I'm not
Ngl I think I'm kinda bi
One barks on the apartment complex on the other side of us, he barks back. Then it goes on for a good minute or two.
Munch is a fairly territorial dog most of the time. He loves to "argue" with the other dogs
It's actually Maximilian, but I call him Munch since I liked the nickname so much
That's the nickname I gave him when he was a puppy
My dog
They also know Munch exists, and do what they can to piss him off
Knowing about the people who live here now, it probably is
But our apartment complex sure has been far different since
Not sure who owns it now
It was just the whackiest shit since he just walks out and sees a conga line
My older brother recalls walking outside to get the mail and he just saw some of the elderly partying through the halls.
She was not a very well-liked person to say the least.
A few years ago the previous owner of the complex passed away
Mom calls one of them "Trouble"
We've started to nickname them
We lived here for 13 years, so we have the right to tell ya to get off our lawn <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
They hate us for some reason idk why
Lmao that probably would happen
Yep.
Since a lot of the elderly people we knew are starting to pass away slowly, we've started to see Karens and their kids flood the house
Mostly.
Yep.
The rental house was probably the only property we solely lived in, even if it was a short few years.
And our aunt moved into our old home where we lived just below our grandma/grandpa
This apartment was our Aunt's
We've been living in an apartment complex for the past 13 years
Our living situation is a bit better now.
Apparently they must've made some good cash to adopt two people and forge a fake family while the police was on your ass.
Right?
And then the SWAT team popped in twice during the time we lived there
Especially since they tried to pass off they were a family so hard
The craziest shit
It's like
Yeah
2008 was when we finally moved, my little brother was close to 2 at the time, but hoo boy. Those 2 years in that city were certainly something with those neighbors next door.
This seemingly normal family? The 2 kids were adopted and part of a setup since this family was 2 drug runners.
This was a year later, after my little brother was born.
Then one day, a SWAT team arrived! Right next to our house.
Then we started to notice that was just a mere facade after awhile. The husband was a bit creepy, whenever dad would be at work he'd be kinda peeping through the windows. Mom would shoo him off, but we knew something seemed shady.
Someone moved in afterwards. At first, they seemed like an average family. Young son, teenage daughter, hard working husband and wife.
When we first moved in, there was an elderly couple. They were nice, then they moved.
Sooo 2005 we move into this rental house that's, in retrospect not the best. Power outages were frequent, wolf spiders everywhere to the point of having to vacuum 'em off walls, and then there's the main topic.
Mentioned in <#337805317276565525> that when I was a kid, I happened to live to an interesting pair of neighbors.
That's some bullshit.
Why ban your own government's twitter from giving info to people on bills?

We do live in an age where the internet happens to control just about every facet of living life
Still, that's *very* weird
Ahhhh
It just weirded me out since it's like, what if my parents/future kids don't know my password? How would Facebook tell "Oh yeah, Das is dead"
For when you die
"Memorial options"
Also under account options, I found something really weird.
That does make sense.
The fact people moved from MySpace to Facebook, soon Discord is something.
Yeahhh, that's the saddest part.
Figured with how I use discord nowadays that I don't really need Facebook as a platform anymore, aside from it being a... ya know... not very good platform.
Finally decided after a long ass time to just delete my Facebook account.
All I'm doing is flexing that I'm an asshole.
That's like if I said, "I got banned from the library for burning books in front of the librarian"
What kind of a flex is "I posted trans memes on a server owned by a trans YouTuber" anyways?
Always hate it when you think you know someone, and they're just still continually a total asshole.
Reminds me of why I dropped my former "friend" group.
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Time to make a discord bot that orders pizza <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
"Look at what I can do with my bot!"
?Open_Airway_Delta
Wtf
APIs on Discord being used for WHAT?
Texas being Texas.
But like, it's amusingly comical.
It's so amusing seeing how Trump and the people around him generally get everything coming to them. I guess my "lefty" side is showing a lot here.
How stupid do you have to be to lie to the FBI?

That people can look at a tragic event and call it a hoax/faked.
In general, it's fucked knowing people buy into this.
With how QAnon thinks, I wouldn't be surprised if they think Columbine was faked.
But we did learn about **the civil war**
I recall we never learned about the KKK in history, oddly enough.
Yeah mb
Ohhhhh
^
Apparently they started all the way in the 1800s, specifically 1865
They are a neo-nazi group that did a lot of horrible shit
Boy oh boy, I can't wait for "State senate passes bill to eliminate requirements that public schools teach that the Nazis are 'morally wrong'"
Part of why I lost respect for Activision/Blizzard is the way that they treat their employees.
^
But I'm sure a majority of people will see "Are you a terrorist?" and tick "No"
Sounds like a way to bait people who sometimes don't slow down to read the fine print
I think the last proper good CoD title imo was Black Ops 2
Yeah.
Activision has done a laundry list of bad things, but I'll never forgive them for making studios that were great during the 90s/00s/10s like Raven, Neversoft, Treyarch, Toys for Bob, etc. work on CoD or shut down.
I miss Raven Software <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
Since they made a lot of great stuff
But it was more about the developers under their wing
Eh... if we're talking the late 90s/00s
It's a shame what greed does to a business. How a giant that's well loved for their games can slowly trickle into a really bad business.
Blizzard especially
I miss Activision/Blizzard when they were, ya know, at their peak
SomeOrdinaryGamers - A great channel who talks about gaming/tech news - just released a video on it
And the fact someone took their own life this time around? I'd argue this is their lowest.
Each controversy they seem to stoop lower and lower.
Remember when Blizzard banned a streamer for "Free Hong Kong"?
TL;DR Blizzard has just gotten into a huge lawsuit over their environment being very hostile towards women, and it even lead to someone losing their own life.
What a clown.
Now it makes me wonder about what other scummy behavior people are up to behind closed doors at AAA companies.
Man, does that Blizzard/Activision thing piss me off.

<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
My favorite football team is Pittsburgh because my mom and entire other family likes them.
Though I only really enjoy the Indians.
I'm really, really optimistic in Cleveland sports moving forward in a way
"Guardians won the world series" sounds pretty badass.
Yeah, I really like it.
Yeah, I really like it.
It's called the Hope Memorial Bridge
https://twitter.com/Indians/status/1418767336530661377
The name for Guardians comes from these structures called "The Guardians of Cleveland"
And it's our football team
Makes me wonder about other teams and if they'd change their names. I know my city gets flack by religious groups for having a team with the name "Demons"
I'm giving you that one
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Given how the Indians name has been used for 60 years, though, I am really curious about how expensive merch when they were called the Indians is going to be.
TIL that the Cleveland Indians are gonna become the Cleveland Guardians. I'd say it's a really, really cool name change.
Even moreso because of the history around Acti-Blizz and its controversies
Questionable at best.
The hypocrisy of most businesses is just
^
I wouldn't be surprised if they just fired some low level employee and get a slap on the wrist.
Knowing how the industry is
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
But in the meantime, this was before I showed back up here, I was making friends with other people who were into Symphogear. And I can say now that abandoning them was... just about one of the best decisions I've made.
Sure, I felt immense regret since they were about the biggest group of friends I had.
Honestly, I felt a change in the wind the moment I left them several months earlier.
Thanks Zoe.
Hm... No. Afaik we just used discord, none of them really use Twitter. The one friend I have is on Steam.
Hm... none that I know of. After all, I diassociated myself with most of them down to only keeping the one guy added since he and I were pretty close.
I'm thinking of wanting to message one of the people I'm still friends with to tell them things are better at least, since that guy and I are on better terms than the others. But I feel conflicted in doing this because... what if I open myself up to the people who got me to say and do edgy shit that got me in trouble in the first place all over again?
Remember when I said that I used to be part of a very toxic "friend" group?
Hm... I'm conflicted on something.
<:FujitakaSalute:688199574917087256>
Reminds me of a meme when someone who was browsing r/manga saw this ad and was like, "Isekai titles are getting out of hand"

It's Hero Hei. Just about any topic he can milk about "Person who said something is wrong! Look at what happens next!"
What's worse is I never login on my laptop, so he'll linger.
Hero Hei continues to be YouTube herpes <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Ohhhh
"Hey, delete this important app while a pandemic is still well underway."
Why is the UK government ran by a bunch of jackasses?
<@!263983345669505025> Normally when I see a subject like that, I assign it here since it's more of a serious matter
Who can forget the legendary "WOW! WOOOOW!"
I know he faked a few of them
Piece of shit
My mom was all over watching that last year.
Talking about Milo btw
Apparently he was recently spotted being kicked out of a courtroom for the case of Roger Stone because he was sleeping
Same.
It definitely lead me down a spiral of being a pretty shitty person. Last year was both the worst part and the end of it.
I went from being liberal to "Anti-SJW" for a large phase
It's weird
Legit one of the most hard working men I know.
And just retired last year.
My dad worked for a city close to ours for over 35 years
Ohhh yeah, my parents were the same.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
But they get pretty much talked down.
Yeah. I've definitely noticed my fair share of people still in that phase.
That's part of why I left my "friend" group, given they were nothing but bigoted assholes who were really pushing on you wanting to be edgy.
Hell, up until last year I was kinda influenced by those jackasses lmao
I notice a lot of people had an "Anti-SJW" phase during like the mid/late 10s
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Iirc Chris Hansen was involved, but it was more or less information most people knew.
It was just so interesting watching progress get made on things, and I've heard nothing about it since last year.
I find it odd how it took them **that long** to realize how fucked their writing was.
Since that was being constantly updated and in general isn't as fucked over by each expansion as WoW is
WoW in general was also already damned to have people leave to subscribe to FF14
Everyone's faith in Blizzard during the mid/late 2010s was at a decline. They really weren't the same when Diablo 3 came out, and only continued to keep sinking.
Again, they continue to stoop lower and lower.
It's a shock so many creators of iconic or otherwise big things turn out to be people with awful views on things.
^
Fr fuck Activision-Blizzard to such a high degree.
And they're already as low as they can go.
They're playing the world's biggest game of limbo.
YEP
Considering they had to get a piece of Gilgamesh pried from them, I'd have shut them down sooner
Has anyone thought to shut them down yet?
I still remember how everyone, myself included was constantly discussing it pre-being let out of school
But I still scraped by with mostly A's and one C.
The last half of my Senior year consisted of no finals, teachers who had no idea how to use Google Classroom, and in general was oddly more relaxed.
Yeah lol
It's kind of a shame since we had prom and the "Student Olympics" planned for the Seniors already. I was really wanting to walk the stage like everyone else before me.
And our district was planning on using those as "COVID Days" for sanitizing the school, sheepishly thinking we'd be going back in.
We just about had no snow days that year.
On the topic of lockdowns from <#336310266654490624>, I actually remember really well when things were spreading
What the fuck?
On top of grandma not being great, grandpa is going through dementia. I was surprised he knew who I was and was asking me about what my dad was doing.
Tbh I don't mind them sometimes, though going off what mom's said, I definitely feel a little frustrated with things. Especially since grandma herself is pretty bad. It was far less evident as a kid for me to notice. Hell, my older brother only noticed it when he got older and I soon followed suit.
Thanks.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Where dad is neutral about the situation, though understanding, mom is pretty on the fence about allowing our grandparents back into our life because my grandma was pretty abusive to my mom. Pretty much our whole life she's been badgered for being a shitty parent when she isn't. And our grandpa I genuinely feel bad for because he got with her and had no idea she was this bad.
Part of being at my grandma/grandpa's yesterday was pretty odd. I've mentioned before on another server with a few users here that my grandma is narcissistic. Mom was pretty upset with the whole "I need my computer expert and handyman" thing because she'd wanted me and dad, hell, nobody else, to get involved with them outside of a few phone calls.
Even before the early 10s, since 2007 was when the trolling started.
^
Since, ya know, it's a documentary.
GenoSamuel is the only YTer I've seen who discusses Chris's life in an unbiased manner.
Sorry. The reply thing did it automatically
A woman famous for a comic named Sonichu. But that's just scratching the surface.
Call me a Dhar Mann video title, because I immediately regret looking up why.
<:NotLikeFist:689188869974786133>
Oh. Oh no.
I've been kind of reading about CWC for years and uhh let's see
Oh lawd
At this point, they've gone so low in the game of limbo that they're nearing the surface of the earth.
They're probably so crammed full of controversies
Given they're the biggest media company on the globe, I don't see this as much of a surprise.
Things have certainly taken a turn.
Null, the guy who heads Kiwi Farms, has been helping out Chris financially. And Null decided he'd open up a GoFundMe for her when they planned on going to the convention. But considering how things went?
Chris was planning on attending a My Little Pony convention called Everfree Northwest
https://twitter.com/KiwiFarmsDotNet/status/1421178331102388235?s=19
People have already called the PD where she lives.
The wiki people made to document Chris is down atm.
Albeit I don't watch them anymore, I acknowledge they were at least incredibly influential.
He, Markiplier, and Pewds were like the holy trinity of YouTube for awhile
^
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
~~This is why you always wear protection, people!~~
He also does have a fanbase of mostly young kids
It's a very awful situation. We live in a world where the loss of a person can be joked about for clout.
Yeah...
TL;DR he took some time off YouTube to cope with the loss of his father, and when he came back there were some unforgivably dickish people who decided to meme on the loss of his father.
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>

As Muta said, these people are more just doing it to get attention for themselves. The fact people have gone *this* low is abysmal.
I just find it odd that they get the military specifically involved. Can't police setup blockades or something?
True.
What mental gymnastics must you play to use military intervention for people to stay inside?
Sorry. We'll move.
Thanks to Raven developing Soldier of Fortune 2 in conjunction with Jedi Knight 2, thus sharing a few of the code
Iirc JK2 also had actual dismemberment if you knew the console command
I recall being bored by like the first hour of Jedi Knight 2 and never touching it
I need to play them again sometime.
You can't just say "Oh yeah, we're taking your book. Have a nice day."
Tbh Disney de-canonizing a majority of SW Legends things? Ok. Even though I don't agree with most of them, especially Revan, have it your way. But this?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Cannot be serious
You just
Damn.
Said incredibly homophobic comments.
Some rapper that was a meme earlier this year
Honestly never followed him that close, but hearing this? Yeah. That's a good thing.
Nice.
Idk why I do it, it just... happens.
Sometimes I just get a little tired after watching an episode or two of an anime, go into my room, and just stare at my wall.
Mood
"It's time to watch another anime. No wait, it's too late into the day. Fuck it. I'll play my games instead."
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I honestly never thought Chris Chan would ever be hit into the mainstream.
And that had court cases, but wasn't anywhere as widely covered as this
I believe that the worst thing they had done before this was macing a GameStop employee
Hell, people use Christine to make fun of trans people already.
They were already a huge punching bag for autistic people beforehand.
^
Hoo boy...
Idk why the whole "rise and decline of commentary channels" era is as nostalgic to me.
Especially 2016.
Same. YouTube in the early/mid 10s is so oddly nostalgic
Yeah.
I'd fling shit at a TERF.
Can't wait for the Mega Man X variant
Lain itself being a story about how the internet influences life in general
~~Also I still find it mind boggling that this is the same guy that wrote Lain writing about this~~
Konaka's been up to some odd stuff lately
https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-blizzard-employees-abk-coalition-reject-bobby-kotick-law-firm
I get Texas is ran by absolute jackasses, but dismissing a global pandemic when a new variant keeps getting added every so often?
^
That aside... who's idea was it to send people to school *with* a positive case?
^
It's like it never ends
It does have a huge influence over the net as a whole, but not as much as it once did.
Oh yeah. I never interact with any part of that aside from hearing about it on the occasion.
If you had used 4chan or something during the mid-late 00s, you might've known about Chris-Chan
It was a more "deeper" part of the internet for a time I guess
I remember discovering it in 2016. A lot of it is knowledge I wish I never really knew. But it's a very, very cautionary tale of how the internet and poor parenting affects a person.
^
And that the person themselves was gullible enough to give out so much personal info
^
Never in the millions of years of human history did anyone think the most researched person would be a transgender comic artist who made a Sonic/Pikachu hybrid
Even going as far as to say they are using he/him pronouns "for historical consistency"
But it's a place that's pretty on the offensive when it comes to the way it describes Chris and her life.
There *is* the CWCki
Yeah.
And on top of that, it isn't even anywhere near the current events.
They're almost all 40-50ish minutes in length
Some range into 40 minutes.
But due to the recent controversy, Geno decided to delay it until 2022
It's at part 59 atm
And it's the most unbiased, straightforward look at them. Starting all the way from the beginning.
GenoSamuel has made an almost 60 part documentary on Chris Chan
Yep
^
Chris Chan is the most notorious example of how social media/the internet affects a person.
I'm betting that it's boiled down to the people who follow Chris around and harass the people she gets involved with.
Regardless of the things she's done, I don't want to disrespect a person's preferred pronouns.
I've always said "she/her" when referring to Christine given that's the pronouns she wants to go by.
I'm seeing a lot of this lately in regards to the news.
Why is this a thing
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
imo
'Cuz stuff like this is really, really bad.
Good to know Apple is continuing to stoop lower than they already are.
We also didn't really like iPhone/Apple in general since they were pretty much overpriced junk compared to other things we had
Especially since my family and I were barely middle class
I've always used Android
Noooo thanks
Anti-vax newspapers?
Yiiiikes
Because those are the two of my heritages
Or Italy
And I wish I could move to Ireland
I'm American myself
That's what happens when your health organization disbands and isn't worked on for a global pandemic

Exactly.

What zero pussy does to a mf
I hate these sorta channels
I... don't like to think about that phase.
But I remember how horriblly it influenced most of the people who were in their teens like myself
I was born in 01 and kinda saw stuff in real time
God, Gamergate was such a clusterfuck
God
By the time I reached the end of the Poppy segment I was just
Saved myself before I got myself too full of bullet holes.
Hey
But I mean
Which goes against my family being really left leaning
I was "Anti-SJW" until like mid last year
Yes.
Guess which one I fell into lmao
The GG years were either "You saw through these people's bullshit" or "You got indoctrinated and learned too late these people are dumb"

<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
All I knew and enjoyed was their debates with uhhh
I didn't even know Destiny defended Rittenhouse or was a massive transphobe
Goddamn
Contrapoints <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Ignoring political YouTube in general is far better
They've debated Sargon
Or
I shouldn't be surprised
Given they're associated with Sargon
I mean
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Everything else was disturbing
Hell
Wtf
The fact she can get away with this and have it all covered up just because of what her mom and dad do is beyond fucked.
^
I'll try to remember they/them so I don't misgender. Given they/them is a neutral term.
Yeah mb
Yes
Bluespike was the troll who pretended to be "Julie" but was a 13 year old boy that was catfishing her
It upsets me
The fact this has happened before with another troll in Chris' past, Bluespike
To the point of their own social skills, ways they interact with the world around them, etc. being documented.
I find it sad knowing that they're also this well documented
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Then stop viewing yourself as a failure. I don't meant for that to sound rough or aggressive. Being put into a hole of self-pity is something that happens often.
Hoo god
Just saw a video on that earlier
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
It's just a matter of getting the strength and support to get yourself out of it. And buddy? I'm here for ya.
People, regardless of who they are will always find themselves in a bad corner in life.
Even if you think you're the worst at something, you're always the best at it in the eyes of others.
And finding yourself to be a failure at everything? Everyone's good at something.
But in the end, building on your mistakes will lead you on a swift road to recovery.
Last year I kept kicking myself down until I was at the bottom. Telling myself that no matter how many times I think I've learned I never do.
I feel ya.

EncyclopediaDramatica ended up having the person who ran the site go to jail for forgery
KiwiFarms is pretty much going to end up like EncyclopediaDramatica
What's comical is sometimes there *could* be a contradiction or two towards the author's beliefs in their works.
Still, the whole "Art vs. Artist" debate is something I tend to think about a bit.
~~I was always more of a Star Wars kid anyways~~
Yeah...
Because the creator of the Neverhood, Doug TenNapel is a huge transphobe to my surprise.
And it turns into an "art vs. artist" situation.
I was thinking about the game I was talking about in <#337805317276565525>, specifically its creator. And tbh it's always a shame when you like a game/movie/etc. and hear about how much of an asshole the creator is.
Iirc yeah.
And Kanye ain't the cleanest celebrity either
You know you've fucked up when *Kanye* is dropping you for saying homophobic shit
I remember hearing about that word being in a Mario Party game and they had to alter it
It's always kinda sad seeing a community you held dear slowly dwindle.
I love servers like this since yeah, where I did kinda miss out on seeing it at its peak, it's still active and the people who do commonly show are pretty nice.
Feels odd having nostalgia for early 2021 already.
Been watching that Wonder Egg server I mod slowly dwindle with activity and whatnot. Imo it was and still is a server I hold dearly, especially since I mod it. But seeing it now compared to when it was first started, you ever just pine for those old days for whatever reason?
After all I had been through, I couldn't believe I spent 2 years with people who I felt were just friends since I had nowhere else to fit in.
And it was in breaking from them that I felt a sense of freedom.
Which made me say things I immensely regret.
They were some of the most vile, racist, and bigoted assholes I met. And their influence rubbed off me and stung pretty deep.
I was once apart of a group of people I nowadays struggle to call friends.
I think the biggest breakthrough this year for me aside being here was something I've mentioned once or twice
Then I flew back up.
Bad during the first half for me stooping to a low I had no idea I could see myself falling into.
2020 was a year that was definitely bad for everyone. For me, it was somewhat alright.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
That's the philosophy I've built on.
And where I can't change the past, I can sure as hell make up to those people I hurt.
Part of learning from those mistakes lead to me being who I am now.
For as much as I hurt myself in some parts
In trying to fit into a community like r/konosuba, I failed because I was just an egotistical, selfish, and above all else cruel jackass. But in the year since, I can say I've seen, been through, and done so much.
I know last year was that for me since not even I understood myself.
The former is tough.
The latter being the most important.
Life is about finding those who understand you and understanding yourself.
And in the end? It looks like it's paying off.
Got myself into shit left and right, faced many trials in wanting to raise myself from seemingly broken ground.
This year in general's been rising up from the dark pits of the last year.
And this year's been seeing myself recovering.
But it's also for knowing that I kinda went on a rocky af trip in the last year
I guess it's more just because i knew some before from other servers.
Y'all mean a lot to me and I've only been here for 2 months.
Mel pat circle
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
I've seen Rakhi around. She's hella nice, though I don't have as much of a good connection with her as Mel and Lily.
I speak to Lily on the occasion. She's cool af.
^
Mel is like that cool older sister I wish I had
It's like I've been here for years.
But with all the friendships I've made here
I've only been here for awhile
I like places like here because the community is a lot more tight knit and less out of control than the servers I'm normally in
The server's grown so big that I feel checking in every so often is the best method.
That's part of why I don't use the Wonder Egg server often aside occasionally talking in a channel or two or doing mod stuff
^
But hey
Due to being a pretty stubborn asshole and all
I took tight knit servers for granted last year admittedly.
^
Interestingly a lot of the anime I like are about that sorta thing. Tatami is about how opportunity is always dangling in front of you, and Sora Yori is about how you should live life to the fullest.
I think that's my favorite theme and why I love it so much.
But hey, ain't that a theme in Symphogear technically?
Never expected to have a full blown convo in this channel slightly about the past and the hills we climb to get over it.
And given how nice people are, I think it's paid off pretty well.
I changed myself for the better just to be here
How many people from then are still here now?
Sure, as nice as it'd be to be on r/konosuba and be forgiven for my actions, I like knowing I've at least made up with several people from there.
And that gives me the strength to move on
I look at them and remember who I am now.
Hey, the good thing is I'm not letting those thoughts get to me as bad.
Sometimes you just think of the shit that went wrong and how you didn't have the strength or mind to prevent it at the time.
But idk
Ofc those'll go away
Yeah.
It's worse because sometimes I'll be laying down and think of those scenarios from a year ago
I know there's definitely personal demons I have to face at times, but I turn those away a lot.
Yeah.
All last year I thought, "How can I fix the past?"
Sometimes our past can get in the way and halt our progress.
We all have our demons, even more demons that we stow away and try to fight another day.
Matt, imo you've been nothing but a great friend.
It sure does take a lot of balls to look at yourself and say, "Oh yeah. I've done a lot wrong." sometimes.
Tbh I have a thing where if I like someone and I feel like I wronged them, I want to prove to them I've changed.
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
That's fucked.
Still
This is the *Brazilian* voice actress btw
Goddamn
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm pretty surprised we've never had a proper fire evacuation.
Thanks.
No smoke or anything. It's like it goes off every time some old person forgets their lunch is cooking and it starts to smoke up.
And it seemingly goes off every one or two weeks.
At this point in our apartment complex, fire alarms are stupidly common for whatever reason.
Yeah.
Boy oh boy, do I love it when the fire alarm goes off in our apartment!
Most people group lolicon with pedophilia anyways since ya know, it's looking at images of a little girl at the end of the day. Drawings or not.

It's human to have those moments where you're in a hole of despair and have no idea how to claw your way out.
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
You're very chill.
Don't know too many other people who talk boomer shooters constantly with me, nor are as enamored with all the stuff I'm usually into
Yeah.
Friends are for several things. As an outlet for your troubles and to support you.
I was just saying you did a great job at describing things exactly.
Oh. Sorry.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Zoe owning this conversation.
^
Part of being human is hiding some of the deeper emotions and confronting those yourself.
^
I like you a lot, Matt.
^
Sometimes.
You, too, Yui
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
Sure, I have hobbies and other things to do. But things just feel a lot slower now that I've been not really doing much aside the occasional household chores and feeding my dog every day.
So I'm kind of... slowing down a lot.
Mom doesn't want me to get a job just yet
Tbh I think that's just my brain adjusting to being quarantined.
Mood.
As in, you know you have things you want to do, but would prefer to just lay down?
Ya ever get to that point in a day where you feel needlessly tired?
There's something about getting that negative energy out that's a driving force to wake yourself up.
What I like to do when I have negative thoughts is lay in bed for a few minutes, then dispose of them once I'm ready to start the day.
Things can really spiral.
When you're with a group of people who share the same emotions as you do
They were pretty much all angry people.
Yeah. I've mentioned that toxic "Friend" group before I had.
Ohhhhh
Also try not to be around negative influences as much.
I still get mad playing games I know I'm good at
^
Humans are driven by emotion. Be it fear, sadness, guilt, anger.
But I've learned plenty over these years that anger really isn't the best option. It's an emotion that has its moments when it seeps out.
I also am quick to anger in certain instances
I've lived for 19 - almost 20 years
This year, they were pretty capable of it. Doing a lot to focus on not just being with students, but also letting them work at their own pace.
I remember when I had to graduate in 2020, not many teachers knew how to take advantage of Google Classroom
Though I see no issue in at least having planned online work.
Correct.
And not giving people an online school option sucks.
And you'd think after a year of dealing with a global pandemic that, ya know, they'd step in with extra safety precautions
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Good with sports, best at education, but poor at maintaining health
Our school district is praised for its education, it being considered one of the best in our county
Yeah.
Mom is so afraid she's gonna try enrolling him in Ohio online school stuff.
Yes.
One time some kid in my little brother's elementary school brought home lice.
My school district is also infamous for kids being sent in unknowingly sick with stuff and spreading it to other students.
The interior of the middle school was a total clusterfuck.
They were all hugging and excited to see each other again.
Yeah. And there's kids that are walking around without masks on and shit.
"We all can't live in fear!"
The teacher's response?
Especially for my safety, since I have a heart condition vulnerable to airborne diseases.
Mom talked to a teacher and mentioned that she's very afraid of letting my little brother in with the new Delta variant.
People are really acting like COVID never happened.
So my mom took my little brother to school yesterday to get his schedule. And uh...
Some would call up "Oh yeah, did your son do (x) project?"
So they didn't really know how to work Google Classroom
Except most of the teachers in my district are boomers
Online classes for me went about the same
Nice!
It lacks the personality you'd see with each teacher face-to-face over seeing them on webcam
Over getting in your pajamas and logging into Google Classroom or Zoom
There's also a different feeling of going to class and sitting with friends/classmates
That makes a lot of sense.
Looking like that cyborg from that shitty fighting game
Who pinged?
But I'm sure they might have seen these
Not sure if mom or dad remember since they were born in 1969
Yep.
But you can say anything that's several decades old hasn't aged very well lol
Yeah... a lot of short films during the 40s/50s/60s were pretty bad and don't age the best.
/j
Ikr? Unbelievable
Anti-Gay propaganda is unsettling.
Ohh no prob
Since anything can be published onto an app store. You just have to present a product to the store and they'll do the rest.
There isn't really a quality check afaik
Yes.
Take the majority of the Wii/PS2's library for instance
Shit you'd throw onto a big market to make a quick dollar
Shovelware is low quality/awful stuff
So I imagine it is technically public. With how much shovelware is on Google Play, it's definitely something I could consider public service.
Well, the market for mobile is massive.
https://www.reuters.com/technology/skorea-set-curb-google-apple-commission-dominance-2021-08-24/
Lol
In the means that if you play the audio through a bot, you skip the ads
I imagine this is only happening because using Groovy/Rhythm takes revenue away from content creators?
I remember in my former friend group we used Rhythm iirc
Iirc yeah
To my knowledge, no.
I don't see the issue in a bot that plays YouTube audio. If they have an issue with bots that play YouTube audio, I imagine they'd have an issue with news sites that embed links of YouTube videos.
Wtf
https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/24/22640024/youtube-discord-groovy-music-bot-closure
With many people aboard on one flight.
And it's especially worse since you're on a plane.
^
And I kinda do as well
I have seen my parents/older brother agree on this
^
But I suppose it being named Delta already cost them a lot
Odd how they aren't specifically calling it the Delta variant.
https://twitter.com/SweeneyABC/status/1430534784074256388?s=19
It's human to make mistakes. But even more human to admit to making them.

Friends are a safety net in that regard. People you can easily rely on to help you bounce back.
We all have mental breakdowns. I've had 'em, we all have 'em.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Yeah wtf
Thanks.
Given I did have my issues with fitting in at first as I said before
I think platforms like discord help express myself more than school ever did for me
The complexity of the brain is interesting, yet daunting
Which would've been at the start of that year
I recall talking psychology during my iirc Senior year in HS
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Sorry. I'm just a little... lost with this sorta thing is all.
Exactly.
It's more about what the person can do, not what the world wants them to do.
I'm more about individuality.
Society as a concept is extremely odd.
Not sure if there's any worse company that's fed propaganda that awful about it
*Cough* Autism Speaks
Wait... why would people want to remove that?
But without being as focused on things I really like and being able to talk with other people about them, I'd have not found better footing. Trying not to sound bad about this at all really.
Without autism, I think that I'd have just accepted that fact.
Personally, the world is a very bleak place.
But when I went up to high school, I was far long past that. It's better since it isn't as socially overwhelming for instance.
I remember I used to be jealous of my older sister taking normal classes with me being stuck with smaller groups
Exactly.
Which is one of the few surprising things about my family I found out awhile ago
My mom and dad have a learning disability, but it's been said my dad's dad had autism
I recall in school I was around the age where these sorta services were getting a lot more increasingly better tbh.
Waaaait, I didn't know you were autistic tbh

TL;DR Epic makes a MLK event in Fortnite, which on paper already sounds like a bad idea considering the previous time they made a BLM event there were players that threw tomatoes at the screen
It's funny considering they compared having Fortnite removed from the app store to the Civil Rights Movement. Baffles me Time even got into cahoots with Epic knowing this.
On a few servers I'm in, even.
Saw this talked about in <#407060923078017026> and a bit here
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Yeah. She was hospitalized for a day or two now, but I'm hoping she recovers fast.
She ended up getting hit in the chest cavity and it got ruptured pretty bad.
My sister is back home with her boyfriend now
But she's apparently severely hurt in some way. Not COVID or anything, but still.
I've no idea what happened
Received news my sister's been hospitalized for some severe internal issues.
Thanks Hibiki!
It's gonna be a little tough these coming weeks, but I'm sure I can handle it.
Not that I'm lazy. I have a few issues sensory-wise with my fingers. i.e. I can't really shave without someone supervising so I don't screw my face up.
On the topic of what i was talking about in <#336297387863703552>, mom's gonna start making me become a bit more self-reliant than previously
ü´Ç
<:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>

<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
And I thank everyone of you for being good friends. This is easily the comfiest server I've been in.
Things now are a lot better than I thought they'd ever get that's for sure.
I've said that my past wasn't really *the best*, but being here and getting to right it was certainly when I felt a huge weight get lifted off my back.
Just wanted to say out of random: Thanks for being a great friend circle.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Ohh for fuck's sake.
Competitive Melee has been a thing for awhile now
It's already played afaik, just not to the extent of Melee
They're trying to push Smash Ultimate to be played I guess
Right
Not like people can actually buy Melee, Brawl, etc. new anymore. Most have to either rely on used copies or use a disc that's probably on its last legs regardless of how well kept it is
"Hey this is an IP we made and you're playing it with mods, staaahp iiiiittt"
Calm down with this shit

The other one is the "Devious Licks" challenge where kids have been stealing soap dispensers, school phones, etc.

Note: They don't get hit, but it comes *very* close

180GB of pretty much customer info (sans credit card info)

A device used for smoking weed
Ngl forgot the Cinnamon Challenge happened
Ohhh right
Though with the way it's handled, I'm surprised there hasn't been some platform to try and replace it yet that's seen moderate success.
I can say somewhat the same.
MySpace was replaced by Facebook, Facebook was replaced by Twitter, Twitter is soon to be replaced by something else
Just to go 1:1 with TikTok
Like having "Shorts"
Since even YT is beginning to slowly try following trends
YouTube is gonna slowly become replaced by TikTok I feel
The commentary channel craze, drama left and right
2016 YouTube is oddly nostalgic looking back despite it being the beginning of the monetization hellhole
At this point I think social media has continually devolved, and 2016 was probably the last decent year for things
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Or hell, anything that could cause legal trouble
But to my knowledge, there wasn't anything *too* life-endangering with challenges
Everyone when I was growing up said YouTube was bad for people's health and shit
Arguably the most poorly ran social media platforms of the past few years
Because it's Facebook.

You're pretty much telling someone that people are looking for you and saying bad stuff is going to happen when they find you. Of course I'd take them to court.

A large fanbase attacks people that the influencer points at, what else is new?
Mom's been stay at home since around my older brother was born.
Since dad is getting a part-time bus job with our school district.
I think she might go back to being stay at home.
Aside that the people aren't really that helpful, and she was in general getting really stressed since she had no idea how things worked.
Mom's gonna quit her job today due to finding it pretty stressing <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

Currently it's just opening doors for him because he can't budge them open and following him around when he lets out a small cry so you can help him get around the house.
Oh yeah, I'll give him all the cuddles.
This was honestly incredibly stressing. I had *no* idea what happened. He never got into anything or got hit in some way. But the doctors did say he was struck near his backside, so nobody should pet him.
Thank you. I'll do everything to help.
It does yeah.
Humorously enough, we called his tail the "Flail tail" before because it'd wildly swing around when he got very excited. Now he's on painkillers and is safe for now. But dad has been up all night with Munch, so he's crashed on the couch.
He has this thing called flail tail, which was caused by him striking a nerve near the lower half of his body. So now everyone has to be very careful with petting anywhere near his backside. Otherwise, he might yelp loudly.
Quick update on Munch:

Early this morning, dad came home with him after spending all night in the emergency room with him.
Finn I hope is alright
I do too. Poor Munch has never been like this before
It's so sad because it feels like this just came outta nowhere
Dunno what happened, but he might have a UTI. We put ice on his head and he's just laying there.
My Munch is also sick too
So my little boy's getting better fast
While not all the way up, Munch's tail is wagging wildly!
Seems to always bounce back from this sorta thing.
He'll be better in no time I hope.
Limber tail normally takes a few days or 2 weeks to recover from
Brief update for y'all involving Munch:

Today he's been wagging his tail around, which is a decent sign of progress.
But weed candy?

We are living in a weird timeline.
What the fuck?
Just say something along the lines of "I'm going through a tough time right now and would like to hand the server over to someone else"
I know Armis did exactly that with her server
Oh cool!
We're taking small steps towards independence. I just need their help sometimes with things, like shaving due to my sensory issues.
I'm not too scared given how I have my older brother and my chores throughout the day keep me just occupied
Yes. Turned 20 this Monday.
It just kinda feels weird knowing both my parents are working, as growing up my dad was pretty much the only person that worked.
My older brother is up most of the day, so I know I can really rely on him.
But she thought I was gonna be a little scared not having them to rely on since they'll both be at work
Dad scored a job working at our local bus garage, which is great.
Mom was talking with me about how next week things are gonna be a lot different
I know with World of Warcraft they had to make some restrictions to sell it in China
Idk why China is suddenly getting super strict with video games now

And you can really tell Twitch was owned by Amazon given the rampant advertising of products like New World and such.
Amazon bought Twitch in 2014
Yep
So they might as well get that money.
Twitch is part of Amazon
RIght.
^
And 3090s are pretty fucking expensive.
Amazon really should compensate for that as well, especially considering people would be out of playing their games for awhile.
Yeah.
Though I have a 1660 Super so uhhh
I am surprised the rig I have hasn't been nuked yet since my older brother's been playing it since beta.
Yeeep
My point is that Amazon as a company has had their fair share of failures already. New World is seeing some great success now, server issues aside. But when you see them from the perspective of a games studio, their other projects have really crashed and burned. Crucible crashed and burned, they cancelled several projects. The only things they *really* have to their name are New World and a few licensed games. I sure as hell trust them with a Steam clone in a market oversaturated with Steam clones.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> Yes
If Epic and uPlay are anything to go by, having your digital service owned by a company relevant in the game industry is pretty severely flawed. Be it for them misunderstanding simple things, like Epic not having a cart system. Battle.net is Blizzard/Activision.
We already have uPlay, Epic Games Store, GOG Galaxy, Battle.net, the list goes on.
> An unreleased steam competitor
I've a feeling that this'll fail honestly. Twitch is owned by Amazon, but PC distribution services are already flooded to shit and knowing how hard Twitch has failed with other gaming related projects? Certainly gives me doubts.
Yeeeesh

Very cool news to share: Dad passed his bus driving test!
You're seeing it with video games now with open betas for almost every new multiplayer game that's come out. Now we're at a point where we can't release a complete product anymore because people can just release an unpolished mess of a game, operating system, or piece of software. And then the company will continually patch things in as they go along.
We're entering an age where that's becoming a possibility.

He really didn't want to get out of retirement so soon, but he also didn't want to waste the CDL he had from a year prior

It's honestly pretty terrible. We live in an age where big name products could be bought out and reworked by malware distributors
Saw this awhile ago
Everyone has a low point. Even those optimistic and peppy people out there have had them.
Suicidal feelings are the worst. But the way I kick those kind of thoughts back is knowing that even if I don't think it, I'm living because I have things that I really want to do. I have a purpose, and If I die at my own hands, that'd be the worst thing imaginable. Suicide is a permanent solution to a temporary problem.
Alright. Thanks.
I am glad it isn't a whole group

Oh yeah
They basically jump on him for it. Say his hate is stupid.
And he gets sorted out right when he brings his BS up
Though I do notice it's like one guy
Yeah
They're not as bad as them in that regard tho
I don't talk with them too often, only popping into VC once or twice. But at the same time I don't want to fall into that hole with the one group of people I used to call "friends"
So I got to meet some good friends I've known since elementary/intermediate school on Discord again. The only downside is they do have hints of homophobia/transphobia, and idk how to approach it.
A fucking lad

Holy shit
That's very true.
Violating someone's trust and them feeling uncomfortable with me just hurts.
That's true. Ntm I only knew them for awhile since we only really knew each other through here. I still feel upset regardless because I mean...
Something that's been bothering me since around this time yesterday is how I lost a friend due to me having violated their trust. I feel like this is gonna sting me for awhile, but I'm definitely not too happy with things atm.
Life can suck, even to people who pick a good hand.
He dropped out when he was 18 and that was the last I saw of him. His brother apparently did the same and dropped out to work at a steel factory.
That happened with a friend I knew since elementary school
That one
Oh yeah
Are people just now finding out about that one? I just see Neil debating Ben and didn't know they debated in 2019
No wait 3 months ago
2019 iirc
His recent one
Just send them back Neil Degrasse Tyson's debate with him
Oh boy
<:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
Ben Shapiro is someone I genuinely cannot take seriously in politics.
Oh yeah same. Ntm when I do have a social media I normally just wanna post about games and stuff.
Ntm following someone political could open a can of worms with your followbase. You never know.
I hear my mom talk about political stuff a lot already

Speaking of TYT
As for commentary channels, people are only switching things up because the idea of "This is my take on (x)" got repetitious. Leafy sure was funny the 800th time he bullied a kid, riiiight?
He just stayed alive due to the Paul Brothers
Tbh YouTube stopped being fun around the near end of 2016. Keemstar is saying that "cancel culture" is why he's retiring instead of ya know... iDubbbz calling him out and him being hugely impacted.
Scarce wins <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
He announced this yesterday
Oh ok
Did I start this?
I sometimes miss it tbh. YouTube in general has become this widespread shitfest and 2015 was one of the last good years on the platform.
That's how they're still going since they don't try to do their take on every single piece of drama that occurs on the platform
Oh yeah. I do enjoy their content somewhat, but they're moreso just finding other things to talk about beside YT drama
So this turns into a TL;DW of "I'm moving on because I don't want to adapt" on Keem's end
Those still on the platform at least
I do have odd nostalgia for that timeframe, but most creators moved on from it.
The idea of gameplay while talking about something has been on a decline since Leafy left. You only see a few channels like that nowadays, but they're not pulling anywhere near as many views.
Nah, my room with a fan on has a higher IQ than them <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Like I said, they're here too. Doubt they lurk or anything, but damn I can imagine the truly room temp IQ takes they'd make if they interacted.
Now that's a new one

Then this dude comes outta nowhere and says "Bro you got a Symphogear pfp and you're complaining about leftist politics"
There was this guy on another server when I was talking about news and how I don't really enjoy listening to politics due to hearing my mom watch a certain type a lot
But Cert gets my point
Jkjk
"That guy has a Maria pfp, he's probably really horny and likes Metroid"
Someone's pfp really doesn't dictate if they're a problem tbh
Than 2.6k peeps
Ya know I thought this server was bigger
I mostly see the same faces save a visit or two from other people
Tbh there are only a couple of people here at once. It's not like a huge place where you see 10-15 people a day
Me when the chef cooks a really good steak.
It is a name everyone does recognize at least. I don't know too many people who'd call it Meta.
Fair point.
Meta just sounds strange. Like it's some whole other platform entirely.
It's been Facebook since launch. I'm calling it Facebook
That's going to happen hilariously enough. I believe it.

I remember on the Animemes server someone did rant about it
I was kinda upset atm and wanted to kinda explain my situation. But I was too tired to properly construct a "Any advice" question
I did not mean for this to sound like a vent, but it did. So sorry.
Last night I was pretty pissed off so uhh
Yeah I uh...
Thank you, Mac.
My biggest issue is the fact I'm always trying to push him the right way. So is my older brother and parents. But it's as if he's so indifferent
I know he's at that age where he is rebellious.
I'm so fucking done with this little shit.
You confront him about something? He locks up. Refuses to acknowledge he's wrong
He stays up all night, he normally never does things unless you tell him multiple times, his refusal to do any work unless you push him.
My little brother is just... Why? Everyday I struggle with him being this rebellious 14 year old that's overly obnoxious.

When their flagship game is about environmentalism...
Sega also did NFTs
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
You'd think after Brandon Lee got killed by a real gun filming The Crow in '94 they'd think to use guns then, but no.
All the backlash is deserved quite honestly. You're a big name people look up to. The people there came to see you since they like your music. So it's pretty fucking stupid to just ignore something entirely even though you've had your eyes on it.
Bands like Radiohead and other musicians have done this before. It's honestly baffling that they're aware something is up yet just continue along like nothing happened.

So does anyone else have that weird habit of clearing your friends list every once in awhile? I swear I do it sometimes. And I'm a little OCD about the number so it's either a 0 (140 for instance) or a 5 (135)

This is just something I do I find weird and wondered if anyone else did it. I think for now I'm fine since the people I have added are mutuals server wise or people I talk to often. I quite like y'all.
I.e. I only will DM people if they DM me or they want me to send them something/talk to them about something privately.
I guess on Discord I'm a little more anxious in regards to this since most people that unadd me are mostly people I don't talk to in DMs. Sometimes it's weird when we're mutuals and talk often. Ntm being me when I add someone, it's because I share a server and like said person since we talk often. I'm just pretty shy towards private conversation unless it's someone I trust
But Steam I never modify my list
With me on Discord I'm a little more "Oh yeah I'm going to just keep IRL friends and people I know are good friends close"
Oh yeah same
At 120 friends rn they're all from servers I'm in or friends from high school
Tbh I only remove people if they're from a group of people I moved on from or don't talk to.
This is the most active I've seen it

I just find it weird since this person knows I have my moments, so it felt like a breach of trust to me. But I guess I understand why they did it.
Thanks, Sam. I'll do what I can to try and generally brush this off. I just feel a little annoyed with the one friend since they pretty much shared things I'd said when I was heated about that other person
That's pretty reasonable. As far as I know, the person that told them I was upset and said some bad things about them is a friend to them and me. I suppose because they know them more, they only told them out of concern.
I've held back on mentioning this for awhile since I know I rarely get mad and have a rage fueled episode
I don't really hold one myself towards anyone, though sometimes I think about a certain someone who I ended up hurting. But after hearing that I was talked about negatively behind my back by them, I suddenly feel those small growing seeds of anger. Those seeds of distrust since I know someone shared this info to them for them to laugh about me. How in the world do I fight this?

And ofc they don't really harm the environment that much considering the items are all unique to the game and nothing more.
TF2 and CSGO have established trading communities that anyone can learn the ins and outs of
Tbh the only time I ever found a gaming community that was great with in-game item trading was mainly Valve stuff.

During the late 90s there was a lot of companies who hopped on the idea of being able to go online. A majority of them fell.
Much like the dotcom bubble
This is gonna be a bubble that'll burst
I'm a little interested in hearing about this too. It sounds pretty insane.

The way gaming in general has become is such a shame. I suppose that was just something to be expected from the beginning.
This does make me glad I hadn't thought about Roblox in years. The site's actively been going to shit, and even that nostalgia factor is starting to wane since the game updates so much that clunky relics of the past probably won't work like they used to. Games that'd use a tool that allowed you to run by pressing a keyboard button and holding down your mouse button do absolutely nothing now.
But ehhh
I woke up early so I might sound a little rambly
These sites aren't affiliated with Roblox in anyway, yet people haven't been banned for using them due to a very poor enforcement of moderation.
With Team Fortress 2 I can understand why people like to trade outside of Valve's bounds. They even warn you that being outside of Steam if you sign into say backpack.tf or marketplace.tf
Yeah.
But Roblox's marketing essentially became "Hey kids, do you wanna make the next big game? Learn with our tools!" which would be fine, but it's the fact that the age demographic is so small that it feels predatory.
The forums were my first taste of internet culture and tbf I'd rather forget about those days, especially 2016. 2018 was when the forums finally shutdown and all the people there migrated to Discord. Moderation in general is so poorly structured. Even a soccer mom is better at watching her kids than it. To think that Roblox nowadays is "Learn how to code or build to turn a profit" is disgusting. It sorta was back then, but you could obviously just not focus with that at all and socialize.
It was poorly managed back then, as well.
I recall a long ass time ago (2011 it was?) being apart of ROBLOX. Honestly the site being the way it is now still amazes me.
Crypto Bros wanted to make an NFT out of the constitution and failed to buy it during an auction
Dunno when I can go in for my booster

I'm unsure about how the process of dev kits were in the 6th gen of consoles but from the behind the scenes stuff I've seen on some of the old games I play, I imagine the process was similar
That too
The fact the PS4 is x86 architecture enough is very nice since it makes porting these game to PC a lot more efficient.
What is great about modern gaming is that manufacturers are trying to make their architecture more open. They're no longer making super ludicrous CPUs/GPUs that require you to learn the ins and outs of said console to make a port.
Where they effect gameplay, but it's a very convenient effect
I believe TVTropes calls this sorta thing "Good Bad Bugs"
Once I figured that out, there was no need for the dart gun anymore
On the Night Shift mission
Shoutout to that glitch in 007 NightFire that let me just knock people out with melee and not have the game count it as a kill
i.e. Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando fixed a bug with the item that let you find crystals on Tabora and Greblin not displaying them
But if it wasn't, most developers would use a "Greatest Hits" version to their advantage
Yeah. Only the PC versions would get said patches (if it was on PC)
Activision has effectively turned most of their studios into asset studios for Call of Duty. I can't imagine the stress that goes into working on a yeary/bi-yearly game series.
Most games probably turn out buggy messes anyway due to people being overworked.
It is an industry, after all.
You either die a kiddy flash game, or live long enough to see yourself trying to hop on environmentally harmful trends.
üòî
I felt that just recently with Halo Infinte's multiplayer, honestly. As fun as it is, it lacks a lot of the features you see in Master Chief Collection. There isn't even a playlist for gamemodes like Oddball. You just have to queue for quickplay and cross your fingers that *someone* is playing it.
Without a need to patch games, there was more need for quality control. Nowadays you can just release something with half the features promised and tell people, "Oh yeah we'll put in this or that in a few months. Thanks for the $60 sucker."
If you look at how games were back then, if you released a game that was glitchy, janky, and messy, you were essentially ridiculed. These games would permanently be known for their unfinished state.
Of course Microsoft isn't to blame for this. Xbox Live as a service was meant for multiplayer. DLC was just for those who wanted extra maps.
The Original Xbox was a fantastic console and a great gateway into video games using the internet, though the fact that you could throw a physical release out and patch in things later, be that via DLC or just flat out patches, is a practice that'd be prominent generations later.
If I click on a YouTube tutorial and the person is teaching me things poorly or wants me to download a risky app/file/etc, a dislike shows they're not a legitimate tutorial.
In an age where tech is becoming something people rely on more, dislikes are important for certain things.
It's the Gravity Falls meme with Dipper holding the blank paper and saying, "Wow! This is totally worthless!"
This is literally one of the examples Josh Strife Hayes used in his video about con men and "ScaMMOs"

YouTube's copyright system in general is fairly easy to exploit
Like when they took down an NFT game, it showed "Nintendo of America Inc."

There's a certain rush that comes from telling so much in so little time.
Like TikTok, I think the reason Twitter is doing so well is that the content is "limited" in how much you can create. Vine as a platform was only super successful due to it being 6 second videos. A trend that'd eventually catch on years later as content became more bite-sized. Of course there were blunders like Quibi, but overall the fact that platforms like Twitter and TikTok limit how much you can type or how many seconds you have to make something.
Like you said, Twitter is used as a ground for political figures too. The Trump presidency sure did help in bolstering Twitter's strength
Twitter is a you can if you want to ordeal.
Twitter as a platform is so massive, and unlike Facebook I think the biggest driving force is the anonymity. On FB you're always out in the open with your name and everything.
No idea honestly
The new generation just really likes short form content for some reason
Facebook may not be as popular with kids these days, but grandparents and their minion memes will forever reign supreme
Yep.
We're in an era where things like the website we're on now, TikTok, and Instagram are more in with people than Facebook
Social media in general has evolved over the past decade or so. Considering the natural evolution of technology, something viewed as a dated platform is obviously going to be abandoned for a more "in" platform
Honestly it's not surprising seeing Facebook dip so hard.

Kinda nuts to look at music you really like then read all about it and realize there's more to it than the surface level lyrics provide
Adhesive is a song that doubles discussing his addiction to it and referencing his bipolar disorder
Stone Temple Pilots for example has a lot of songs about Scott Weiland's heroin addiction. Vasoline being one such example.
I think one of the best aspect about listening to music you like down to the lyrical perspective is when you read up on these songs you liked as a kid years later and realize how surprisingly intricate they were lyric wise
Yep

Yeah, that's the issue I have with the Metaverse. It's created purely for capital and nothing less. Unlike, say, movies made by independent filmmakers or whatever. Making an entire virtual universe normally takes passion. When your building blocks for a social platform is nothing more than making capital, it makes you wonder where things went wrong.
I think it's just going to be a fad of the 2020s and that's it.
As in, the idea of the Metaverse via virtual headsets actually existing?
Do y'all think Meta is ever going to get anywhere?

Capitalism really out here wanting to make a new platform for people to escape to because the older ones like Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube can't do what their new fangled tech can.
Yep, this is exactly one of my fears
Just reached the part of the video talking about VR housing
To think the worries of yesteryear were Walmart and big brand stores will eat up local ones. Now people's fears are that online shopping will eat up places like Walmart solely because people aren't going to them.
Also holy crap this channel is up my alley (the one video Rakhi linked)

There's also issue with the shipping in general
Precisely

Well, actually dad just does the shopping since I can't really go anywhere
But I do that with PC parts and things specifically. Otherwise I'll go to the store to get whatever I need if it's food or drink

VR is cool but I don't think I'll ever bite the bullet of getting on due to being unable to afford a headset outside and needing to push shit around just to use it
Technology has just gotten too advanced by this point imo
~~Ignoring the Animatrix's expansion on how Machines ruled the world of course~~
Yeahhh, I've seen the Matrix. I'm good on virtual worlds. Especially ones ran by corporations.
For all we see of it, we know it just exists. Nothing to further deviate it other than "Hey, buy our headset"
Yeah, that's exactly it
But for now it seems all the press around it are more about the monetary aspect than it is "You can create your own world"
Maybe someone is wanting to make something cool and unique in the Metaverse, who knows?
I think it's not the greatest example given the controversies surrounding that, but I think it's a better counter to the Metaverse because people can create unique and diverse experiences. And some aren't even doing it for the clicks. I recall when I used to be on there that there were people who would build intricate contraptions and machinery just for the passion of seeing how the engine worked.
Games like Roblox offer up the idea of "Building your own game"
<@!457268466429329429> I think naturally that fluxuating between happy and depressed is normal.
Didn't click on the channel, probably one of the biggest mistakes I made since I had no idea they made such cool content

Or, they told me to DM them
Oh yeah they DMed me
Everyone has their good and bad days.
With the way our brains function, emotions are part of that core.
I didn't barely passed psychology in school so take my words with a grain of salt
~~I just barely passed Psychology in High School, give me a break~~
Just read a summary of it again
Yeah
You could either eat the second marshmallow or wait around until they say you can eat it again
Iirc it was a psychological patience test where you're given a marshmallow and are told to eat it
"Wake up, babe. New marshmallow study patch just dropped."
That's dope
Medical wise I mean. Of course you'd wanna help the Queen.
Knowing how she's the Queen, there's no doubt a good amount of people doing the best they can.
Is 2022 gonna be *the* year?
Ohhh shit

Good on the Republicans for continuing to stroke themselves off I guess...
That's... why?
It sucks knowing that in an era where being yourself is becoming more prominent, you always have assholes like the alt-right trying to prevent it.
I was saying that I can't imagine states possibly trying to enforce this law at all.
It's ok!
I got enough sleep gdi
Why did I say protesting instead of enforcing initially <:BocchiHands:660933135050997781>
I can't imagine too many people enforcing a law this harsh, even in a state as right-wing as Texas
Oh yeah it would be.
This is fucked beyond words.

An ongoing global pandemic, 2 years later now we're gonna see a war.
Things are gonna get freaking wild this year.
My god.
Here we gooooooo!
Yep!
I think so.
Ukraine has had sites like this blocked off for years before

Absolutely.
Damn, huge cyberwar going on
You're right.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
Sorry if I misinterpreted it.
Thanks Mel.
But I am a little proud in how far things have come despite some of the few tough decisions I had to make
Perhaps I'm a little tired so I may have missed Mel's points
Considering where we are now, I'd say I did a good job.
My philosophy in general is always built on rectifying mistakes the best I can.
So I don't think I should be disappointed now, especially considering life has a way of making things work.
Everyone I knew at that point was kind enough to be a safety net. And I'm forever grateful for that.
And I had made a particularly difficult choice around the time I met you in cutting ties with those asshole "friends"
That's right.
Which is pretty damn good!
Given I am also one of the only people who was unbanned, I'd say that opportunity is something I've taken by the horns.
Because that is exactly what happened.
You're right in that regard.
Thanks.
It just disappoints me.
I'm severely disappointed in myself and idk if I'll ever live this down. Just the fact I joined when my head wasn't in the best space, fucked myself over, and got here a year later (or, a year and 2 months later)
I'm just talking about being disappointed not just in missing those, but missing events like April Fools last year. I'm glad I did at least ya know... make it around here in June.
That's cool!
When I mentioned it in <#336299268107403274> I think that part of me is just upset I missed so much because I screwed up in 2020 that in 2021 joining back in June I'm honestly grateful to be here, but also somewhat upset 'cuz I missed so much

They didn't even develop her enough in the anime. Not like they'll remember to do that
Based
Like, I know you can't change the past. But you can edit the credits.
I was also a little put off by HBO Max crediting them as "The Wachowski Brothers" on the credits to the 3 films
Totally understandable.
I'm just asking if it's weird to feel off about this sorta thing
Y'all know I support this stuff
I'm not saying this offensively at all
So... weird question. Knowing that you can't really change the past, does anyone else feel weird watching something from a creator that's trans and it's before they transitioned? When I watched behind the scenes stuff from the Matrix I was kinda feeling off since I'm thinking "Oh well this is from the past, of course no one can really change or alter it." but knowing they eventually transitioned makes watching past stuff a little off to me.
Hollywood being scummy is nothing new. But this regardless is terrible.
Like I said, it reads like an essay someone had to pad out because they were under the word count.
Me neither.

Yes, this is what I'm trying to say
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
So if any of this came across as offensive or negative, I'm sorry.
This question's been on my mind awhile and I was hesitating on asking it because I know I have a weird issue with phrasing
Unless there's some weird legal obligations behind it, what's stopping them?
Or is in the process of removing them from the games
EA Sports has removed Russia from the FIFA games
https://twitter.com/EASPORTSFIFA/status/1499057030857777154?t=YyE0M3oW610WBX8NopyU4Q&s=19
I thought it was to an extent.
Can Texas just not lmao
I do remember being in 6th grade still cuz I'd be in 7th later that year
I forgot
Oh yeah
I thought I remembered 2013 was the last time Russia tried to step foot on Ukraine
This situation has been a boiling pot for decades, yet I'm still surprised to see it unfold
That sounds awful.
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Snopes says that:

> Context: "Anastasia" was indeed removed from Disney+ in February 2022. However, the movie was removed for contractual reasons, not political ones, as the film was simply being moved to a different streaming service, the Starz movie channel.
It's more about Disney and 20th Century Fox's copyright feud
AV Club says that Anastasia leaving Disney+ has nothing to do with the Ukraine-Russian war
Since I can't really go anywhere
When I was done with high school, everything became a game of 'What does Donovan want to do to pass the time?"
Yeah.
The worst aspect about this is I had a "case" with the Ohioans with Disabilities board but that closed when 'rona came around
I can't really do much now because that social security fund makes me a sitting duck. I thought the lifestyle of just chilling and watching movies, anime, and playing games would be cool. But it really wanes after awhile. The fact I yearn to work is kind of odd. Like that one meme.
Hoping 2023 is finally that year I get a job.
"Anti-SJW" stuff kinda did spring from GamerGate afaik. Too bad there are still far too many "anti-woke" people still around
Coming from someone who is pretty left-leaning, I never really understood GamerGate. It was a clusterfuck to say the least, but I recall being in that "Anti-SJW" phase for like years until around 2020-ish
Damn, this is a great lecture to watch

I just took it 'cuz a friend on another server tried it
Yeah... it's eh
130 appears to be the "mean" score for people with autism, which I'm fine with

Took this earlier out of curiosity
https://embrace-autism.com/raads-r/#test
But it was also because they rated another game at a lower review threshhold
I remember hearing Sony got particularly upset that Tools of Destruction got a 7 from one outlet, so the reviewer responsible for the low rating got booted and they went on to make Giant Bomb
Her points were ya know... fine.
Condescending tone aside
Yeah, it's really shocking to look back at that in retrospect and think "People were upset about this?"
^
Even with the most minor criticism Anita could've thrown
So I wouldn't expect less from that to be scummy about this

Again, I'm sorry for last night. My mind was in a very rough spot and I feel I could've been less upset about things. I have no real reason to be upset and in all honesty I feel a little worse that I let myself get upset over this. But it's a new day, so eh.
My apologies. It was late at night, I had a lot on my mind, and in general I feel like shit even more for being so upset about something so absurd.
I sure did say a lot last night, didn't I?
As for now, I really think I should go to sleep. This is nothing worth losing sleep over.
If I do try mentioning this again, mute me or something. I shouldn't be so ungrateful about being here.
I love this server.
Something I say a lot, but I dunno. This thing just ate at me for a while.
Yeah, I should really stop being upset about this.
I think I should not worry too much here.
This vent was made because I was super stressed out and this thought just ate at me. I wanted to squeeze it out but otherwise I think this makes me look worse. As if I'm ungrateful for being here.
Alright, I'm sorry
Deeply sorry I chose to vent about this again. I'll get over it sometime.
Knowing I missed out on fun stuff.
I guess there's just that sadnesses of hearing about "Wow, the April fools joke from last year was pretty fun!" And not being there to experience it.
I'll get over it eventually.
Sorry for again being upset about this.
Maybe I'll eventually get over it. I'm just disappointed that despite my improvement it feels like I joined things too late.
I've just felt off about things since I'll look at events like Carol/Elfnein's birthday vote and think, "Wow. I wish I were here for this."
Deeply sorry.
I made such a big deal out of wanting to come back here.
Right.
I'm just annoyed about what I missed really.
Me neither.
I shouldn't be too beaten up about this.
Right.
If only I had not joined here in 2020 when I was still in my edgy phase and gotten the boot the first time. Maybe then I wouldn't be bitching about missing out on so much right fuckin now.
I mean, at least June 2021 was the time I actually was at my peak imo? But I'm still greatly disappointed.
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
I don't entirely blame them but I'm still salty I wasn't here earlier
Alright, normally when I go to sleep I'm never stressed out by too much but I wanna get this reoccurring frustration off my chest. I know I mentioned this earlier with being disappointed in not being here earlier last year, but hearing from a friend that it was their miscommunication that lead to that does... Sorta get that pot stirring.
Yep
https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1501314842992467975?s=10
Yeah, that's very unusual.
I shouldn't even be surprised at this point
Texas moment
"Supporting anti-LGBTQIA+ organizations? What are you talking about! We have a pride flag as our icon this June!"
Yep
It's funny how this company is pretty much a part of everyone's childhood, yet when you look at them now in retrospect and even nowadays, they're a soulsucking leech that continues to thrive. No controversy could bring them down.
Disney is the same studio that pretty much made Finn's presence in the sequels less prominent to suck China's dick and Mulan 2020 was also a mess in the China regard
Yeeeeeeeeesh
Yeah, I think so too

With games it's different because I don't spend cash on them too often and it's entertainment
That's true. Maybe I'm going to try therapy. I just want to make sure I'm working first because atm I'm government funded and I don't think they'd like me knowing I'm spending that cash on therapy
I'm the kind of person who prefers wanting to figure it out on my own because trying to get professional help costs money and I want to see myself improve without having to rattle off my problems to someone else if that makes sense
Ehh. Not really. I've never really done any therapy outside of speech therapy at school
I like this place a lot, it pretty much being where I hang out about everyday. So treating others poorly the way I have has made me surprised Mel hasn't done anything. One of these days I'll go back to how I once was, but I feel that's gonna take a while.
I'd like to apologize for my recent behavior in the previous week. I've been pretty on edge over things I shouldn't be, overthinking and overall being an asshole to plenty of people. I have, in a sense, regressed. This is tragic for me as someone who likes trying to build themselves off past errors, but in doing so I've both made it pretty far but slightly driven myself to say dickish things or overreact in a few ways. Like someone posting an art link before I do or not pinging me for art I like. In a way this all comes back to me misinterpreting something a friend told me and being very bitter about it. I'd like to say I'm deeply sorry and I can only hope to improve as a regular of the server.

Fox News in general is pretty nutty. I wouldn't trust them.
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
Find it funny knowing I said this last night, despite being a fan of System of a Down and Rage Against The Machine
<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
But I'm not super interested in political stuff outside of vaguely understanding certain topics. Look, unless it's a computer or video game related thing, I'm probably not that good at talking about it for hours
I should def start reading more into political history
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
Mom and dad are super left leaning but dad doesn't talk political as often
My only real political knowledge is from mom
I never was the sharpest student when it came to US History but I don't think we ever did dive into Reagan as hard
Damn TIL

<:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
~~Lol I have no idea who that first one is really~~
And considering we had a tv celebrity run for and be president for 4 years, of course I'd be pretty cynical towards celebrity culture
Thanks. I've just known cuz mom is also pretty cynical about it
But I'm just pretty much used to reading and hearing about people doing insane shit for clout. Ya just grow numb to it.
I probably sound... what's the word? Jaded?
Celebrities are even more driven to achieve it.
Clout is equal to money. It's evil and people are always driven to have more of it.
Isn't being a celebrity partly about attention seeking anyway?
Why stage a hate crime against yourself for sake of more pay?
This is a surreal case to read into
Yeah
I could just be super tired but I find that ridiculous
That's what I'm getting from how the article describes it
I think the one weird thing about this is how they set this hate crime up for what? Clout?
I've just seen this shit so many times
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Like Kyle Rittenhouse
I'm always used to someone doing something shitty and people being like "Omg free them!"
I have my episodes as displayed here, but I think that I can kind of control them.
I'll be honest, I am at that point where I think I can put a handle on my emotions. It is far better than 2 years ago.
I hardly go outside unless I need to visit grandma or have to go to the doctors
Given my heart condition and shit, mom doesn't want me anywhere near the outside until maybe next year
And atm with how mom works and dad might have to work, I'd rather just wait til I can get a job next year then take things from there.
Yeah it's weird. I imagine I'd probably be able to but I don't have it in me to really ask my parents for it. Since anything I buy I have to run through them
It's definitely one of the jarring changes, having the clock set back an hour. Given how shorter days are around Fall entering Winter.
Yep.
This probably had to have been brewing for years at this point.
Anyway, yeah I think that this bill is kind of interesting in the way that it took so long to be passed.
So perhaps before looking into things I should at least read into it and think more before sending so I don't look like an idiot
I don't want to seem hopeless either
Right. I've been struggling with that for awhile
I'm not in a very good mood today sorry
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
Ok I fucking get it
Yeah sorry for jumping the gun
Ahhh
I'm always used to Windows automatically setting my clock an hour back tbh so this would be super jarring as a US resident who observes it
What kinda asinine bill is this?
When I read they were using crappy old tanks, I knew they were an embarrassment
So I apologize if my interactions are samey
Again, I'm not the most politically involved and only really listen in when mom's talking
Ahhh. Yeah.
When NATO is against you, you know you're fucked
Precisely.
I know about the tensions, but even then it's just as bonkers to think they'd charge them
Now I wonder even more why they thought of charging Ukraine
Yeah, that's a terrible offensive streak to be sure.
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
I think that sounds about right
Random question: In the way of Russia vs. Ukraine, how long do you think this'll go on? I remember hearing the conflict was pretty much boiling for awhile, so I imagine it will be a good while
Which I shouldn't be
But I've definitely been beating myself up a lot lately over getting shit wrong
I guess there's something to me about not messing up a punchline or knowing a topic to the point of feeling a little sad whenever I fuck something up
I know I keep talking everyone's ears off about this, but I'm definitely still a little eh. I'll admit today was mostly better, but I'm annoyed with how shitty things got and all it took was me getting upset over minor things. Which is something that, until just recently, didn't happen as much.
I know Mel has contact, so I can only hope we get updates. I'm scared.
I hope they haven't. I really hope they haven't.

You ever wake up and feel like something awful happened? Honestly that's how I felt waking up today.
<#336300750248476693>
And she said I was the "only sane Maria simp" which is about the best Geah related compliment I could have gotten
I have not many memories with her but gosh did we love gushing over Chris art together
^
^
God, this is awful.
I feel bad for having left her server and not supporting her enough as I could have.
This can't be real.
Sapphire, aka Gwyn
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504> Thank you very much.
I'll be open as well. I know this is a rough time, and I wanna help keep spreading the good vibes I try to spread. We could all use some of those, especially now in this saddening moment.
I know I've been in this channel a lot today, but I'm still finding it tough to process this
That's right
I wonder if there's anything we can do besides condolences. I'd absolutely love to help pay tribute in some way.
üôè
I wish I got to know her more.
She made a lot of fun programming things and was a joy to talk with
I remember first meeting them last year with Armis. Before I even came here, I got to laugh at how goofy Shemmy would sass you and compile your dialogue into random sentences
Just the bare basics of that specific absence.
Thank you. I know it was from her server, so I figured that I shouldn't disclose too much detail
Unsure if I *really* should have disclosed those details.
There was also mentions of wanting to move out but her parents not at all wanting to help.
I remember on her other server before I left, she had mentioned issues involving her therapist snitching on her to her parents
I noticed the two servers they were in for emotes they were gone from. So I imagine their parents are deactivating the account.
Yep.
Feel free. I'll provide all the hugs and care.
YEEEEEEESH
I legit am going to be there for her as much as I can. Not to smother her with love or anything, I just feel so happy knowing she's ok.
^
I breathed the biggest sigh of relief.

(Don't look at me, I had a redemption arc)
Yeah, I've def seen that.
Yeah, I think that's why I enjoy the place. It's not a big series in the west so a discord for it only attracts so many people
Majority of our bans now are scam bots
But it's not as bad as it used to be
I still mod the Wonder Egg discord and we get a few people who are disruptive
^
The most lax moderation I can think of
^
Given I joined recently (June 2021), I based my comment off my personal experiences.
You're a member of the community for several years, so I feel there's people who have similar opinions.
I fully understand your need to state it.
That's ok
^
Though that's just me being grateful to be here again in the first place
I find Mel and co.'s moderation to be very fair and on point a lot of the time. Giving people chances to improve and whatnot.
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
^
So I expect there to be at least a few disagreements.
Oh yeah I've seen a few of these here. But it's a channel that's reserved for serious topics, i.e. politics and religion
But I find it odd since I find the community to be pretty chill. I haven't really had any discourse.
Well, I mean... the only channels I've muted are mobile gaming and tabletops
Huh?
Oh?
Laid back
I'm saying "Open" as in we're pretty chill
Oh?
It was.
People think they don't belong here when we're a pretty open community.
That's odd.
Oh. Bye?
Unsure. I imagine they could have.

Metal Sonic had to be booted smh
Or would it just be like writing a paper and crumbling it before tossing it into the bin?
Would it just be a thing I can save and write pages of pages of my frustrations into?
Venting into a doc sounds great.
That's absolutely true.
Sure, I'm here now and can experience things I never got to experience, like the April Fools this year. But wow, do I feel pissed that I missed so much prior to it.
I just feel upset hearing about all this cool stuff I missed because I fucked up so badly.
Late 2020 me wasn't the brightest person, but they were ya know... wanting to at least fix things up. So that first rejection really hurt. Being able to prove myself and get unbanned here was an accomplishment, but I'm still beyond pissed that it happened in mid-2021. Sure, I was pretty much good by then and didn't have moments of blowing a fuse. But when I hear someone say "Wow, the April Fools event of 2020 or 2021 was fun" I kinda... feel a little pissed. Or when I hear someone mention there was some cool event where you got to vote on things
For me, I guess it's that when I wanted to get back here prior, it was late into 2020. When I was rejected the first time, I was pissed. Especially 'cuz I was rewatching Geah and wanted to share my experience with other people. When I eventually finished it in December 2020 and wrote my reviews (which are pretty iffy looking back) on the subreddit, I was pretty... meh feeling. At that time in 2021 I was at least around Mel and she was aware I wanted to be back here. And I'll admit the hype of finally coming here again was so so cool. I just feel so ashamed that I'd fucked up so badly before. That I'd been such a shitty person prior and got the boot for it. Thus meaning I missed so much. I know that now I'm pretty friendly with people, but it still frustrates me to know that my older self came here first. And I hadn't come around here until later.
Again, my one frustration is over something super small. The idea of "Wow, I wish I was there" making me mad when I shouldn't be.
I always do enjoy self improvement, so maybe I'll peep into this
That's true.
The idea that "Wow, I sure did fuck up badly didn't I?' combined with seeing discussions and such I could've been there for pisses me off. It's a feeling I'll probably shake sometime. I like being here, it's about my favorite server. But god, I'm so mad that I missed some things.
I guess the root of my problems is that I feel regret for not being here prior. It's just eating at me that I fucked up that badly and I'm still pissed off with how much I missed. Some days I take pride in being here now despite all that, others I feel disappointed looking back and realizing how much I missed.
I just think that the past is full of so many missed opportunities that I feel pissed off weren't realized until last year.
Even though I know they shouldn't
Tbh I don't consider myself *too* super challenged. I remember last year getting things wrong and being fine with it, not blowing a fuse. I'm probably going to get over it. Idk what the root of the problem is. Maybe it's just now that I've been on here a year, those small regrets I've had like being unable to be here prior are pissing me off?
I'll definitely think about looking into it.
I need to look into online therapy options
Is Betterhelp good?
So, in that case what can you recommend?
Huh.
I could look into that.
I'm *super* vulnerable to airborne diseases.
He's told me he doesn't like to drive much with me to anywhere 'cuz of my heart conditions. In general they want to keep me inside despite having my shots 'cuz of my heart condition.
I just want to have my own place first partly because I know dad doesn't wanna drive me to therapy at a certain day and I just want to handle it myself
And afaik she moved out before she got around to doing it
I guess in general I don't want to go to therapy until I'm out of the house or something. I just wanna deal with these kind of problems once I can get my own place and things to setup. I know Lauren, my oldest, already does it
That's true.
Not saying that to be a dick, I just don't want them to worry about me more than they already had in the past.
I just don't think professional help is something I want my parents to worry about. They worry about enough shit already, I'm sure their adult son can handle himself just fine.
Not getting it anytime soon tbh. I'm fine enough that I think I can get over this myself.
I guess for me the issue is I happen to really like certain hobbies, so whenever I get something wrong I feel really stupid
I have the stupidest fucking issues.
Me and my issues with getting things wrong or screwing a sentence up, god I hate that. I know it's ok to be wrong but my lord is it infuriating to me sometimes. I have an issue where I like wanting to know something I'm passionate about, so whenever I get something wrong or word something poorly and someone corrects me, I feel... idk. I really dunno how to feel about the latter. Because me wording something poorly is a fault on my end.
Tis the effect of late-state capitalism
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I guess at this point, given how I am and the people I used to be with, I just like trying to put forward a positive image when I can.
Thanks.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585> Glad you think so!
My head would explode!
Can you imagine how hard I'd cringe at my past self in a place I'd spent a few months in during 2019 and 2020?
It reminds me of how another server I had some attachment to, r/konosuba, had a similar case. But at this point, considering what I think about the anime, you can tell I don't care about that place or the anime it's based on anymore. Sure, it'd be nice to be unbanned and the person who owns it definitely advocated for it, but I'll be blunt in saying I'd probably not wanna be there.
I was one of those rare cases of someone actually being unbanned because Mel noticed how different I was from that prior year.
Geahcord as a server is something I like being apart of. I shouldn't let all that go over being upset I got booted once. Mel said "Take pride in being unbanned" after all.
Again, part of my anger is just knowing I missed so much because of how I was back then. I love y'all a lot and I wish to keep trucking on.
Now that everything's said and done, hopefully I'll enjoy my time here more without being pissed about the past.
Hopefully that's just the end of it. I got to rant about things that bothered me, y'all let me rant about the things that bothered me.
Yep.
I'm hopefully going to do better.
Sorry to those annoyed by me having filled the chat with my affairs
So I guess to finally put an end to me having ranted a storm the past few hours, I'll say I'm glad I'm here now but I will sometimes be pretty disappointed that I missed so much
Because my god did it seem like I missed fun times. And I suppose I have to blame myself for it
The fact I had to prove myself different makes me both happy and a little frustrated. Because I feel like I could have been here in late 2020, but no. The first time I tried it was denied. And that's why I'm mad.  It wasn't until the start of last year when I was able to prove myself. And in that case, I'm here! It worked! But now that I've had time to celebrate that fact, I have begun to reminisce on how I could have been here before. I'm sorry if I continue to sound like an asshole, I just felt the need to get this off my chest
It's even worse when someone tells me to look a phrase up and I get to look at things from 2 years ago
I imagine I'll get over being super disappointed over what I missed soon. I'm just at that point where I've really began to remember things.
I'd say things turned out pretty well.
Lucky for me I got kicked in the right direction, disbanded from those asshole incels I was friends with and moved onto being here.
I went through the same "Anti-SJW" phase I imagine plenty of people went through. I've definitely heard my fair share of people who disliked that phase.
Yeah.
Dunno why I chose now to be pissy about it but whatever.
I've just reached a point where I really like being here. I'm just so saddened to know if I hadn't messed up 2 years ago I could have been here longer
But hey, again what can I do? I'm around now. I'm doing fine enough.
I just feel like shit still for having missed so much.
Sure, be proud of the person I am now, but I hate what I could have seen and participated in.
I'm just always prob going to think about that time I was abhorrent enough to be booted from here and how I missed so much
You can't change the past. I'm sure if I even went back two years ago and got the chance to reverse things that I'd still get into trouble in some way
I just felt like expressing my one source of anger. But who knows if this will ever be quelled?
Here's to a better me in the coming months.
I'm also going to definitely start venting in a Google doc about my frustrations
At the end of the day, I think I'll search for help online. Thanks to everyone who suggested it.
There is definitely a lot I regret, but what can ya do?
In general I made and said a lot of stupid shit I regret. April 2020 was that peak of me doing more and more stupid shit, but I'm glad most of the people I knew from around that time I've made up with
It's that kind of heart condition where there were holes in my heart at birth, but they've slowly filled. And I'm glad. Though I'm unsure if it's a permanently curable thing.
I had so many abnormalities as a kid
It's still there, but it's not as wide as it once was
I remember in my elementary/middle school years, there was a tiny hole near my stomach for a feeding tube.
LOL
But here we are almost 21 years later, only seeing the doctor every 2 years now to see if it's getting healed up.
It can be afaik. It's a lot better than it once was. At birth I was told I would've only lived a year.
Def going to try.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
But I hear My Sunshine is so freaking good
Then again I don't necessarily read too much fanfiction
Oh damn, I haven't read that one yet tragically
Absolutely.
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
Tbh what's a human if they don't make mistakes?
True af
Like wow. Why am I being a dick all of a sudden?
And saying "Mel can tell me I've improved all I want but I'm still disappointed"
Just now
That's kind of how I got here in the first place. I wanted to be here again, and now I feel like a bit of a dick saying "Wow, I wish I could've been here earlier."
I like using the past as building blocks for the future. Wanting to correct as many errors as I can.
That is a good take.
Write all my frustrations into there and only open it to add more if something happens that pisses me off or I'm feeling like venting about it
That sounds like a fantastic idea. Never thought of that before. Perhaps I should just start doing a "venting doc"
It isn't. I can't imagine ever drinking alcohol to cope with loneliness, let alone knowing how I moderate like one other server
Thanks for your insights!
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
The idea of how foreign language communication sounds to those who actually speak it.
This is a weird question so I don't know how to necessarily phrase it. But if someone has English as their second language, how do things sound in their original language when they speak? Does it sound like English to them? I'm again sorry if this sounds weird because I've thought about this for awhile
Always satisfying to find new links to something two decades after it happened. Now I wonder how many other classified documents will become declassified in the past few years and reveal even more crazy stuff.
Hot damn!
You deserve to be happy, Ella.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
No problem!
Especially if it's a topic you aren't well-versed in
Yumi's advice is also great
^
Being down in a hole and believing yourself to be hopeless sucks.
2 years ago I thought I'd never make friends or be someone after high school. Now I'm here, surrounded by people I hold dearly as friends and acquaintances, and in general am doing a lot better now.
It's human to be at your lowest sometimes.
^
I'm someone who has a past they're just about cringing about sometimes, but I look at what happened and I use it as a stepping stone for the future. And to me, that's the most important part. Accept you've made mistakes and think about ways to build yourself up.
You seem very tense right now and there's no good in drinking it away.
I'm just suggesting a means to destress.
I recommend self-reflecting. Without drinking. Do what I do when you're stressed and play a game or do something to take your mind off it. Start up a bath and pour enough soap to make it a bubble bath
^

Sober up
Moral Orel taught me alcohol as escapism is bad, but that's a general message anyone can understand
As in, mods turning on each other or quitting
I've heard internal moderation for the discord and subs of GAM have gotten fucked over really hard lol
And what's funny is seeing how places like GoodAnimemes built off the "They won't let me say a slur" foundation are beginning to crumble
They did
Mods being sent death threats for not being able to use a slur is so petty
That was such a horrible time
What's funny is that the Animemes discord itself is a chill place
I remember the first anime server I was on was Konosuba but that was during that cringe phase I hate so much where I got booted for being transphobic. Nowadays things are great but knowing how Konosuba fans are, I'm kinda glad I'm not back there lol
Oh sorry
I guess I'm a little more biased because Mel was kind enough to give me another chance
Yeah, I love the server and it holds a deep place in my heart despite not being here that long.
Ehh y'all get the point
But it came at the cost of twisted beliefs and
And some obscure stuff!
Finally, people who played and had nostalgia for clunky 3D platformers!
Honestly hate to say "They were my only friends" since I didn't know too many people who liked most of the same old games I played
I'm forever grateful I cut ties with them and am here now.
I used to, for years be with a group of people who could be described as incels. And my ban from here was while I was under their influence. Their twisted ideologies and vitriol rubbed off on me. But I couldn't turn away because they were my only friends.
I mentioned this to Mel and a few other people, hell I mentioned it yesterday
Same
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
With all this talk I may as well head off for the night. Have a great one, y'all!
What kinda shit was 2016 me on? Determination?
2016 me having the mind to play an RPG twice whereas it took me 3 years and multiple new game starts to complete Skies of Arcadia is nuts
In like one or two weeks
Undertale was a game I loved so much I played True Pacifist twice
Also seeing Undertale abbreviated as "UT" messed with my brain because I normally read that as Unreal Tournament
Too bad gaming channels will spoil what or who the final boss or ending of a game is before release
Mood lol. Unless it's something I am super interested in like Psychonauts 2 I never look into spoilers
I've just learned to enjoy the games or things I love and try not to dive too deep into the rabbit hole of fandims.
Hell I've been a Sonic fan (please don't hurt me) for god knows how long and I know it's one of the worst fandoms on the net
That's true
The hatedom is definitely bonkers
I've definitely heard about the series and its issues. It's like Fate or Genshin where I don't want to go anywhere near it but like the art that gets made for it
That's... absurd. Even for a company
Ohhhh right!
Wait what?
Alt-right transphobes are already bad, but Rowling is obnoxious

When I heard Tom McDonald described as "Republican Rap" I immediately stopped taking him seriously
Yes
Yep.
Of course it's insensitive now. I'm glad that Bruce is actually retiring, leaving behind a pretty good legacy considering the Die Hard films and other big action films.
Not defending them too hard or anything
Tbh they were just doing it for the giggles. Retroactively, it is insensitive yes. But I don't think they expected this at all.

Mines, huh?
What the FUCK
The best way to use Twitter is to not use it at all in my experience.
I think that the joke was good and y'all shouldn't have gotten flack for it.
Sorry, made a mistake in my other sentence
Well, one person we all know
I mentioned it in the other channel, but most of us aren't ya know...  supportive of NFTs saved for one person I know.
The joke had a lot more effort put into it than people sticking a server ping icon in the corner. I like the prank because I enjoy a good piece of satire.
I guess timezones can be blamed due to some being past April 1st
But here has been a bit of a rough spot
How nice the server is
Yeah, I am normally always saying
It is.
If a user has an account to point to, just say "Follow (account) name"
I think another interesting idea would be having Archive of Our Own, we can make a community fic account and upload them in monthly chapters as another way to archive them.
^
Yep, you can revive them afaik
A drive folder would be cool.
That'd be interesting. Each thread giving someone time in the spotlight
I'm on mobile atm and I didn't think that the discord app would let me view it
Ahh right
But that shouldn't be too bad since you'd be adding enough content for it to not be "archived"
I think the farthest they can go is a few days?
True
I know. The thread settings archive if you set them to 24 hours by default
I know a few that will but it's for mostly niche things. Like Elden Ring spoilers
One of the ideas I can think of is having a thread specifically for prompts and receiving a ping for a new one each day.
How the approach will be, however, is up to the prompt team I feel.
I've seen threads work pretty well.
The longest supported Windows OS was Windows XP, at a staggering 13 years of support from 2001 to 2014
Windows 2000 was also supported for 10 years, support ending with XP Service Pack 2
Same with Windows M.E.
Beforehand, Microsoft would make OSes obsolete whenever they saw fit. Windows 98? Initially was going to end support in 2004. Google search numbers revealed some stayed behind with 98, so 2006 instead.
This 10 year lifecycle thing Microsoft does has only really stuck around since Vista
Yeah.
We quickly learned our lesson when it was a really buggy mess on a laptop that could initially not run it great
Devin and I did that with Windows 10 back in 2015
Windows releasing the OS for free as an upgrade is just lmao why
The convenience of Windows is it being a platform that's been around for a long time.
With so many different ones out there, I think it's gonna be hard to create a "master" version
Developers have even said with Linux ports they wouldn't do it again cuz it's that taxing on resources.
Yep
This means driver support really varies dependent on what distro you're using
What Linux users face is that there's multiple different builds off the same kernels.
Steam Deck has pushed it fairly well, but it ain't to the point where you can run anything without issues
Yeah, it's not quite there yet
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
File explorer ads, because whooo I like being advertised to when simply browsing my files...
Yeah.
Windows 11 in general I might stay away from. I'm keeping Windows 10 until 2025 tbh
What's specific to note is they insert that search term even though they hadn't searched for it.
Pic from another discord I'm in, Windows shown to be cramming ads into 11 kinda like 10
It really does suck that so many variants have expanded in the course of 2 years

I'm having a brainfart but I think that Will resigning I guess would be a good move? It beats the Academy firing him.
This whole thing is pretty nuts getting back on topic
Mainly because of my airborne sickness vulnerability I don't go out much
But even then I don't go out much due to the pandemic. Dad does a lot of the work when it comes to going out and getting things.
We don't use those either unless it's the car
Mainly since I don't use Twitter nor do we have cable
Honestly would anyone have known that the Oscars happened this year of the slap hadn't happened? I sure know I wouldn't have
Yeah
Yeah I dunno
The slap itself felt like a skit even. My mom felt it was faked just for Oscar viewership
Yeah
Ahh true
This is odd. An actor can drug, assault a 13 year old, and leave the country and the academy will love them. But a slap gets a resignation...
https://twitter.com/THR/status/1510030736174170117?s=20&t=5lMedqDPmOkNzmOUKYc71w
It's an idea that'd really benefit that channel the most
I'll be anticipating how threads get used for <#357682999300718592>.
So we don't have individual threads for each fic. But you would be able to pin each prompt featured that month so people can read and discuss
Full thread with each prompt + discussion
I.e. April 2022 prompts
Monthly prompt thread would be a nice way to go
Oh right
Having a Google drive for discussion preservation would be good yeah
Windows XP - 7: "Hey if you don't buy a genuine copy, you're not gonna be able to use your computer you filthy pirate."
Windows 10: "Hey, I'm not gonna let you change your wallpaper and there's gonna be a watermark smack dab on the right of your screen."
Windows 11: "Your start button and icons are gonna be in the center lol"
Speaking of Windows 11, I just remembered how lame Windows got with anti-piracy

Just to continue getting updated
I remember people were so attached to XP that they went onto Windows Embedded and POSReady 2009, the latter of which being an OS meant for point-of-service OSes for kiosks and shopping terminals
Damn, there was an article written in 03 about it
https://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=30697
Yeah
Well, I'd argue XP and every OS til 7 was at least laid back in the "This is your PC and your right to use it" thing.
Right. Wasn't Windows since XP when they introduced the activation thing a bit of a "phone home" OS anyway?
Some governments can't really afford to switch their PCs to that new fangled OS like Microsoft would want, given how old the programs they're using are. Wouldn't wanna risk inconveniences on modern hardware/software
I hear NASA uses DOS for some of its terminals, which is fascinating
The PCs themselves aren't connected to the internet at all and just exist to schedule programs.
Yeah
Media Center Edition I remember being on one of my grandma's old PCs that she gave to us because she forgot to upgrade to XP Service Pack 3 when everything was running SP2
And the PC that runs the schedule is using Windows XP Media Center Edition
It runs Windows 2000
Shoutout to the high school's TV station PC that plays the bumpers in between replays of our basketball/softball/whatever sports games
Some PCs still have to use certain OSes because of the software being unsupported on modern hardware
Yeah. XP was a widely used and supported operating system.
Licensed NFTs are a terrible idea. You're putting an investment into a brand you don't even know will last that long.

Pretty much what I was thinking
Yeah at most he'll likely yep
$2.9B put into Twitter
I'm not trying to sound narcissistic at all mind you. Even if I do slightly
You're right
Good question. I guess talking with someone about my issues and having them discuss it seems odd when I can just think about and dissect issues with myself
And in this case, the one thing I think I should do and keep working at is just slowing down and thinking about what I type. Hell, just take a few seconds to read and not react as badly as I have
Idk. I just like the feeling of finally having the core of my issues stomped out. So when it clicks I feel incredibly happy
That sorta thing. Since I build myself off learning from past mistakes
No idea. Sometimes doing something on my own makes me feel proud. Actually getting my situations sorted and going off the trials of the past.
I've been doing better at times but I feel odd. There's nothing for me to be upset about, but I foolishly overreact
I've always said Mel is pretty nice and relaxed when it comes to things but I think I'm beginning to push myself here. I'm fearing I'll be punished in some way if I don't get this under control
I just hate knowing these past few days it's gone off a few times. My overreactive tendencies are gonna be the end of me.
Not wanting to really do therapy I guess is one problem. I feel this is something I'll solve on my own.
I'm still scratching my head and I think this is hands down the worst behavior of mine. I wanna be nice but somehow someway I keep fucking myself up
It's ok to be wrong, idk why I get so upset when I get corrected. Y'all have seen it. I'm unsure if it's because I'm super "competitive" when it comes to things, wanting to be a know-it-all in topics I'm super interested in?
It's my Achilles heel at this point
I'm always trying to kick back that but idk why I always screw up
God I gotta stop getting so angry over minor things but when I think "Oh yeah I'm fine" something small sets me off and I think that's my biggest problem
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>

Morton's Fork?
So... How close do you think Russia is to just backing out? I don't follow the news closely but considering Ukraine is being supported by a lot of the major nations, Russia really screwed themselves big time
Right
Per week I think.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> Thanks, Lily
A little.
And I'll strive to do a lot better
My mind was not in the best place
Sorry for my outburst last night
I'm just stuck in an odd spot where I'm beginning to worry for some stupid reason
I want to do better. I know I can do better.
This is a hole I can and will crawl out of but my god it's just abysmal to think about
I want to do my best and I've always tried to push my optimistic image but now it feels like everyone is seeing that stupid side of me I didn't want to display
I hate being this much of a mess
God damnit I'm such a mess rn
I'm just having a bit of a weird mind screw rn. I'm very confident in this just being something I can and will stop but I had dumping off my frustrations on my mind
Sorry everyone
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I want to find help but I think my biggest issue is that I don't know where to look and I'm also fearful of spending any money given it's the government's
See? This is why I'd rather try fixing things on my own. I'm not gonna pay that much for something I can potentially work through
$65/4 weeks? Fuck that!
Oh. Nevermind.
So I might see how that goes
Welp, just signed up for something
Maybe. My mind works in odd ways, but I think I should genuinely start looking online
Thank you Yumi. I'll probably try to peep into options for therapy.
The last thing I want is a community I've worked so hard to get back into to be gone.
I'll go ahead and try to look into this. Find someone or something to help.
That's not at all the push I want
I guess I shouldn't be on edge at all. I haven't been verbally warned for too much. Nor have I been consulted privately and told when I've stepped out of line. I shouldn't worry about this as much as I do
I remember that fear being here when I first came back since I was under a scope for a while, but it went away very quickly
I always fear I'll screw up and get booted when I really shouldn't.
I'm just a little surprised y'all have put up with me doing this kind of thing
That's right.
And I always feel remorse when it happens because I worked so hard to control it from not appearing again
I've been seeing more of that dickish side I do my best to lock up briefly appear
I shouldn't feel miserable since I worked hard to get here and feel like me lashing out like this goes against how I spent time trying to get back in the first place.
I know I've done this a lot by this point
Again, sorry for bitching
Since I feel my troubles really aren't able to hold a candle to others
And honestly when it comes to talking about problems like this here I kinda don't open up as often
I'm thinking I'll start seeking therapy once I start getting a job or something. At the moment I'm not wanting to do anything that requires going outside because of my heart condition. And going on the internet to peek for one seems iffy to me since I really wouldn't know where to look or what to trust
Right.

I just heard the "Bruh" sound effect and looked over
And while I was minding my own business coming downstairs and hopping on my PC, an hour long ad of Indian comedy popped up in the middle of the let's play
Then there was one time where she fell asleep probably from watching Jacksepticeye and a PewDiePie lets play was on
I remember one time mom had a video on and while she was asleep, a whole ass Verizon meeting played for about an hour

We were running XP at the time since the family computer was initially a Windows ME upgrade
I remember when we bought Star Wars Battlefront 2004 on PC, one look at the readme said "Hey, if you're running 98 you should upgrade because its end of support date was this year."
Brief fun fact about this: By the time they said 98 was gonna be axed by 04, you already saw developers for games go off that
Even unstable, janky messes like Shogo Mobile Armor Division I got working with little-to-no issues
Since I remember Windows 7 in my years of experience with it being one of the last Windows OSes to be compatible with most of my old games
That sounds like a great plan actually
Ahhhhhh
https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10
You can actually go to Microsoft's website right now, download Windows 10, and upgrade for free
Still on 7?
No graduation at all for any of us. It was just a case of walking in and getting your diploma.
But I haven't been anywhere near the school since the day I anti-climactically walked in and got my diploma during Summer 2020
It was rumored they were planning on buying new PCs
And our schools all used dual core processor Dell OptiPlexes with 4GB RAM and all
Using the Summer to upgrade
I remember my school immediately swapping to Windows 7 when using XP transitioning from 6th to 7th grade in 2014
It's meant to be supported for 3 years after January 14th, 2020. So we're near one more year until 7 is really dead in the water
> ESU is only available for Windows 7 professional and enterprise
Windows 7 is a rare case of Microsoft going "Sure, we'll support this one for another few years. If you pay us."
XP was a rare case of "The market is still using it" so it got an extra 2 years before finally burning out in 2014
Actually wait, I'm wrong. Windows 2000 was supported for 10 years with Service Pack 4's support date ending in 2010.
Windows 98? Already 6 years old by 2004, let's axe it! Oh wait. People are still using it despite XP being out? Fuck, we'll toss its end of life date to 2006
They'd axe support for OSes whenever they felt like it.
Microsoft's way of supporting OSes was finnicky until Vista
When 8.1 happened they immediately axed any form of support for it
I remember 8 was so embarrassing to Microsoft that they pretty much didn't even give it a 10 year support cycle
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Ahhh
Sure Aero hasn't really aged the best but it was basically "What if Vista was good"
Why'd you skip out on 7? It's easily their best one
Lol
Than the 10 upgrade
Now we see Microsoft doing the free upgrade thing again with Windows 11 and it's just as, if not even worse
We were just excited to get Windows 10 free since our family PCs had Windows 8.1
Of course Devin and I had no idea about that at the time
Yeah
So just another attention ploy from a stupid celebrity? Got it.
Who knew "Free upgrade" =/= Beta tester?
... Only for it to have activation issues, be pretty laggy, etc.
I remember when Windows 10 upgrading was a big deal for us in 2015 because Devin and I were excited that we got the new Windows OS for free
I might get Linux to keep gaming, but again I doubt that
Too bad I ain't switching to Windows 11. I'll probably stick with 10 til the end, and if it's improved (I highly doubt it)
This does sound a little cool honestly

Perhaps I should binge them
I've seen you link them a lot
Valid point.
I guess immediately regretting my anger is a form of getting closer to being a little more decent. I really haven't had a full blown explosive fit here at all. Just venting.
Sometimes if I come across as heated I think, "Shit shit shit not like that"
Normally I have an issue overthinking
That's true
Well, I dunno about that. Sometimes I read before posting, other times my head doesn't give me a few seconds
Perhaps I should do the old method of reading before I think, or recalling what that person has/hasn't had in common with me so I can explain my point better
It's becoming uncommon but it sparks up every once in awhile
I'm just upset with myself because I try to act nice and sometimes when I do I lose my cool during conversations when I don't mean to
Hell, perhaps right now seems like an overreaction
Sometimes I think I don't deserve this place, what with how I've been recently. I want to be chill but I have my moments where I flip out trying to explain something to someone
I'm a mess sometimes
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Oh boy, another night of losing my cool over something arbitrary.
I used to, but I got rid of it for some reason

That's right
I'm often pretty positive with a few spots that aren't as hopeful/dreadful
Expression can be defined as your personality at times ig
Hm... that's a good question.
My poor communication tends to get the worst of me, but I've learned overtime expression is more important than communication in some spots. The people around you tend to know that if you say one thing you feel is poorly communicated, they understand
I feel that

All you need is a browser like Opera or something that blocks ads and common sense
Windows Defender itself is a meme, but I still use it regardless since I don't go to dodgy sites
Mainly because I wasn't a fan of Chrome after a long while of using it

Never have quite used Firefox honestly

Ty Lank and Kerrik
That's true
If that makes sense
I just feel both happy to be here and frustrated I missed so much
Jealous of not having been there to participate
I hear about all these fun past events and it gives me a sense of... What's the word, jealousy?
Idk why, I just feel sad when I hear about people mentioning fun things in the past I could have been there for. Like how this same thing happening this year happened last year, or how people got the opportunity to vote using one of the bots for what character's birthdays are on which days
But it's def been a thing in the back of my mind for awhile.
This probably wasn't a phase you were all expecting, suddenly seeing me upset about not being here earlier.
She's the reason I'm here in the first place
But that gives me no right to consistently jab at Mel about it
I shouldn't be as mad as I am about this, I'm just always prob going to be disappointed in knowing there were so many things I missed.
Now that I'm back I'm one of the only people who's been given a second chance I've heard. Unless there's been a few more after
I think that's my biggest issue here, getting sad at the thought of having missed things and blaming others for certain factors when I have myself to blame for being booted 2 years ago
Apologies for earlier today. I really should stop focusing on the things I missed and just accept knowing where I am now

But instead of using it to laugh and think about how much of a dumbass I was, it comes across as "Oh no what have I done"
I guess I think about the past a lot because I remember that person I used to be
That works
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
And I know for a fact I should stop focusing on those things if I'm so embarrassed and frustrated by them
I have definitely been writing about it too much
You're right
I haven't lost sleep over it at all
Yes
I'm guessing it's because my brain has this thing where it's like "Hey did you know on this day 2 years ago something happened you still kick yourself over despite everything being ok? Just figured I'd remind you."
Idk why I chose to remind myself of certain past events
Being here now is pretty much the highlight of last year
2020 was easily a year of me consistently falling into pits, the year after being really good
But that's all I have to comment on really

I remember 32-bit being super prominent for a long time, then 64 became the standard around Windows 7 iirc?
So when will we begin to see 128-bit versions of operating systems?
For fuck's sake

<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
128 bit is probably another decade or so into the future
I know 64 bit OS variants existed prior with Windows XP and all
2038 I have read a little into, but afaik it's a time encoding error that on 32-bit systems will have devastating effects, as 2038 will be when they reach their limit
Which would've lead to banking systems and the like not working
Y2K was a bug PCs had where PCs were representing programs with the final 2 digits, i.e. 1999 would be 99. So the year 2000 would be indistinguishable from the year 1900
Aka "Y2K for a new generation"
Hell, recently PS3/Vita titles have begun expiring due to a thing called the "Unix epoch" engineers decided was the beginning of an operating system's lifespan. Which leads to the "2038 problem"
Businesses utilize them, generally speaking hardware shortage and the idea of technology going obsolete in the span of a few years can be a serious topic
Thinking about PC upgrading eventually, but idk about that given the shortage that's been going on for 2 years. Maybe? I was glad to build my computer in August 2020 that's for sure.
Whoa!
She's told me to wait til next year for looking. And honestly the idea of Devin and I both working sounds cool. I just wanna work to sharpen my social skills a bit more and my skills with things in general. PC hardware repair has always been my thing so it's easy to understand why I wanna get out there and get a job in that field
Too bad she's possibly going to be laid off for no reason.
She was pretty much always a stay at home mom due to dad working long shifts and having 3 kids to take care of. Well, 4 when Conner came around. So you can imagine how all over the place things got.
Mom only had to take up the mantle of jobs recently. In Summer 2016 she worked a job involving elderly care with her experience taking care of grandpa. But her primary job was being a stay at home mom. Now she can pretty much be both given she's at home on the PC
At first he was wastewater treatment, but he got promoted near the end of his time to an engineering position of sorts. Generally doing all kinds of city work.
His job was cool. He told us stories about him being able to drive this mini car around a sewer using a PS3 controller
He'd only retired just to be with us more. That and COVID being what it was.
I hope he can find something new. His long lasting job saw him working for the city neighboring ours for around almost 30 years
So he has a license to drive big vehicles but nothing to use it on.
Dad I'm unsure if he's going to get a job again. He's been retired for 2 years now but I remember when he tried bussing for the local schools. Unfortunately they ghosted him after a long while of training
Mom has been at her stay at home job now and is trying to apply for other jobs, but most are now aiming to move back into the office
Devin is looking for jobs on indeed atm. The current state of the house is a bit all over the place.
Since I did that job in 2019 over the Sumner
I've been really interested in computer repair/refurbishing
Hoping to find a job by next year.
Who is Mel?
^
But you already knew that
Yep
Still can't believe it's 2022 and trans/LGBT people are still not accepted by some people.
Perhaps I should back outta this convo mayhap
Yeah, I've noticed that with Mom did that with my grandparents after awhile. She rarely, if ever speaks to them given her relationship
My grandma is a manipulative old coot that's fucked over mom and dad plenty of times, but I still help her out with her computer troubles cuz who else is she gonna call that won't brick her PC
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
I think in this case, they've only done it knowing that one side of the family might be less receptive to hearing the news.
The issues I've noticed with most trans people towards their identity are usually that one side of their family wouldn't take things as lightly for whatever reason.
^
I just don't really consider myself super religious, but I respect those who do
Mom and everyone else sans Dad are Agnostic/Atheist idk
Same
Since he likes the spirit of Christmas
He told us that he'd still buy us presents and stuff even when he's in his 80s
We let dad celebrate it because he's super super passionate about them. And I just really like seeing him all excited
I don't really get into scuffles with him over it, nor does anyone else.
Yep
Given my family is mostly Athiest and my dad is Catholic, you can imagine why they get into arguments sometimes
Yep.
Oh boy, my parents arguing about religion on Easter of all holidays <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
One of the rare exceptions he's allowed on the couch just to lay down
Munch does like us enough to not mind. But whenever Lauren comes over he's always all over her.
She does, however, have 2 cats and Nugget on top of that
True
Honestly that seems really mean to Munch given he really likes her. And likes to think she's still his owner at times whenever she drops by.
She begs for this lil gremlin, doesn't really take care of him as much, moves out years later, then buys herself a new dog.
Lauren ends up moving out and on her own, then just last year buys herself another puppy. She hasn't renewed the license for the doggo since last year. So way to put a beagle/lab that initially wasn't even ours on our hands. Such a shame, honestly.
Reminder that on her 20th birthday in 2016 she was pretty much *begging* mom for a dog. February we finally get the lil guy and Munch is just the cutest despite his issues, and he's a puppy!
"Munch isn't my dog now, Nugget is"
So when Lauren came over yesterday, she dropped a pretty big bomb on us that I was honestly rather miffed to hear.
Patience, Copper. Patience.

So I'm pretty much fine. Doesn't mean I won't catch it.
Mom made sure I got all the shots + booster
But it'll be a lot less dangerous than the first outbreak
It's like the Flu, something that won't necessarily go away
Yep
It's a hard question given how the world is.
True
COVID spread is still pretty bad. There's supposedly a resurgence going on. Who knows how long this pandemic will really go on?
I can see people already going back to norms at this point. Jobs are being less remote and more in-office from all the jobs mom's looked up.
So... what year would the pandemic necessarily be at an end? I'm planning on actually getting a job next year if possible. Could it possibly end in the next 2 or 3 years? Can we expect conditions to go back to normal by 2023/4?
Republicans continuing to be dumb, cranky old men. Like usual.
Oh no 2+2 makes me white!
What the fuck?
April 2020: Bottom of the pit, no signs of crawling out
April 2021: Near the top of the pit, clawing my way out of toxic relationships just to reach a point of sanity
April 2022: I'm trying my best, despite a few hiccups
To this day they've never contacted me as I removed them from Steam and Discord, and I would rather keep it like that
What with how April 14th was... That day. April 15th last year was rather satisfying however, given the people who I was around the year prior that terribly influenced me? I cut ties with them.
I'm sorry to have brought this up again. It's just been on my mind a lot recently
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Right. I imagine too many people would like to go back in time and tell themselves off.
I hate knowing how I was in 2020. I don't really look back that far in my old chat messages because I'd rather not, but goodness me if I could go back to 2020, I'd probably strangle my past self for being so stupidly toxic.
I know you're all probably tired of hearing me bitch about it but yeesh if I'm not annoyed by it still
This cycle of regret consistently repeats because I keep hearing about cool things left and right in the year I was booted and the year I came back, and it always saddens me to know I missed so much
It's a recurring thing for me to bitch about but holy fuck does it annoy me to no end that I screwed myself over that badly
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
God, I sometimes wish I could go back to April 2020 and get a do over with this. I'm always going to be mad at myself for screwing over not getting to stay. I like being here now but goddamn am I still so pissed over having missed a lot of fun stuff
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>

I guess I can take those steps, knocking issues out is a bit of a mixed act.
Yep.
But hey, I guess that happens
It's not like I always have this low of self-esteem when I can't figure something out or get something wrong
Instead it's "Wow, I'm fucking stupid" most of the time now
Why I don't respond with an "Oh, thanks." sometimes is mind-boggling
People can be wrong. People can even not know something as well as someone else... I just hate when I end up knowing what something is, but don't know it until someone ya know... mentions it and I look and go "Oh wow I feel so fucking stupid"
Why? Why the fuck do I do it sometimes?
>I get something wrong about something I'm passionate about
>Start self-deprecating because how dare I not know it
God that's just my worst trait
I'd love to not have a tiny breakdown over not knowing something or not realizing what something is sometimes
I imagine we'll start seeing jobs relating to supporting war efforts from home like coordinate stuff on maps and the like
In-office I mean
Since she's not at all wanting to do job related stuff
She's been trying to look through jobs on Indeed recently, which is good. Applying to several at-home ones
Yep
She even trained these people/days of training with them, so that hits even harder for her
I mentioned this yesterday but idk why they're laying people off suddenly. It's not like COVID will be going away anytime soon given a lot of the newer variants.
>All of mom's co-workers were laid off/fired yesterday
>Mom barely made it by the skin of her teeth
We had to ban one of those bots
Saw that one being mentioned on the WEP server I'm still modding
American schools had *no* idea how to handle Autism/ADHD until I was close to graduating
Mhm. But that's about most of the right-wing party anyway.
Elon's just a dumbass
It was justifiable to suspend Donald Trump given the January 6th insurrection
Would cause a public uproar. At least, from the right-wingers
I'm not an economics major or anything myself, so I hope you don't mind the copy-paste from google
They were wanting shareholders to acquire more shares so it'd make Elon's deal impossible to sell on.
> Poison pill is primarily of two types: flip-in and flip-over. A widely-used strategy, 'flip-in' allows existing shareholders (except the acquirer) to buy more shares in the target company at a deep discount when the potential acquirer's holding in the company reaches a certain limit.
Yeah
There'll be a mass exodus of users if Elon buys it either way. He could fuck up the site or own it, and plenty of people would dip.
But I've noticed plenty of right-wing nutbags use Twitter. It's the popular choice of Republican political figures.
I've seen as an outsider that Twitter is like any social media: A batlteground for about anything

My mom's played Simcity 3000 and a ton of Sims 1, does that make her just as much of a neonazi?
So I can imagine there'll be drastic changes
But tbf this was the mid-late 00s/early-late 2010s
And tbf it did here in High School, I'm not sure how elementary/intermediate/middle is handled
Yep.
Since that was apart of some plan
I did also have an aide with me at all times
I'm not sure how special ed is handled now, but when I was growing up that's what it was like
I'd be in regular classes for most of the day, but they'd be modified to fit what i can learn so it was like my own pace sorta thing
The teachers of those classes are nice, hell even the best. But in High School is when they began challenging me. By 11th grade at least.
I'd go to a regular homeroom, but I'd be ushered into special classes for most of the day.
I remember in Elementary, Intermediate, and Middle school that when I was there, special ed meant I was in a classroom with one teacher most of the day.
I haven't had too many qualms myself here, and it helps the people do their best to help each other out

We all have terrible regrets. It's just about persevering at a time that's considered your lowest that makes you strong. You being aware of this as of late is your first step.

<:kanahana4:580703777011531792>
It's Elon Musk. I think that question answers itself
But things will eventually spill out
Guess it's a goal of celebrities to try and project this positive image cuz you know a lot of people look up to them
I think seeing any kind of rich figure give out their money is a bit of a sign they wanna improve their image instead of "Oh hey here's out of the kindness of my heart a lot of money towards *insert charity here*"
With the occasional heartwarming stories filled in to (not really) balance it out

Believably so.
I'm doing what I can to still at least be well liked but it feels like I'm slowly making that fall apart because of the way I snap at people like Mel

So much for free speech amirite?
I wonder why there's so many of these right-wing social media apps. I know Twitter is essentially a grounds for them even after Trump's suspension, but you also see it be more prominent given sites like Gab and Parler exist
Trump I guess joined it recently from news I've seen
Y'all see that Truth.social app that's basically another right wing shithole app?
Only time I go outside is when I really have to, like the doctors
Tbh I don't ever go outside cuz of the pandemic stuff but just do it every other day anyway.
Right.
I already have brushing my teeth twice a day and getting Munch fed and watered down, so I could really do with getting myself a shower every day instead of every other day
Last year, I ended up doing that for awhile. Idk why I stopped.
Should start giving that a try.
I have been contemplating using a clock a bit more to schedule specific things.
I've been pecking away at writing, but in terms of something I've wanted to rewatch? Only have gotten past the first episode. It sucks since I always have wanting to watch it on my mind
I.e. I have an anime I want to watch, or I have something I really wanna write, but I don't have that proper thought to tell me, "Oh hey it's time to do this or that"
How do y'all handle wanting to do something but not ever getting to it?

Cuz there's my problem, right there. I get one tiny thing wrong, hell sometimes I get a full on situation wrong
Y'all ready?
Guess I'll go on an actual 5 minute rant about how stupid I am for not getting this entire fucking situation correct
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
I'm such a fucking jackass
Damn, I misread this whole thing
Ohhhhh
Time to go on a five minute rant about how fucking stupid I am /j
Damn I misread that so hard
Ohhhhh
The Z is apparently a Ukrainian symbol that was plastered onto Russian things during the 2022 invasion
From what I've read, someone drew a Z while playing on the Ukrainian team

<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
It's literally right fucking there too. I explicitly stated being on the same page would mean that people tend to agree with one another
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
I don't know what to fucking say about shit sometimes
Oh my fucking god *fine* I guess I have to agree with you then
^
Not everyone's going to agree on one thing or another
In general it's a driving force of just speaking in general
Discussion on politics, games, etc.
Because conflict is a driving force in things at times. Agreements and disagreements are part of human nature.
You can't really change conflict, as communication with other people is built off agreeing and disagreeing on our interests. Some are a lot more aggressive about it than others, yes. And politics is all about aggressive debating.
Yep
Not to sound cynical or anything, I just mean to say that in general, conflict between people is kind of one driving factor of the world that can't be changed.
If everyone was on the same page, the world would suck.
Agreements and disagreements fuel day-to-day life more than we think.
The world is never really spinning if there isn't conflict.
I know my parents were happy to not endure 4 more years of the guy
That makes sense
Yep
Now we're 2 years into the presidency and it's surprising to look at it and see he hasn't done much to fulfill those promises.
That is very fair. It kinda makes me remember 2 years ago I had voted left cuz that's what my parents and I stand for, given we don't like Trump at all. And when it was revealed he won, we heard people shoot off fireworks, honk their horns, etc.
Ahhh I see
So why is Joe Biden doing poorly in terms of public numbers?
Ahhh that's a good comparison yeah
This war has been a showcase of how Russia is all bark no bite when it comes to conflicts.
Proton itself is very useful but I doubt it'll push Linux being super on the market. Steam Deck in itself is a fairly cool thing at least.
True
How long ahead in the PC industry do you think it'd be before Linux would see a bit of support for the broader computer market?
That's very fair
That's fair
Ahhh
At least not anymore
I normally don't get that upset about something normally
Deeply sorry for losing it earlier
I guess to me the conflict was moreso referring to smaller things. Of course I was not trying to refer to world conflict. I was moreso talking about how politicians and the like will always be stuck in a cycle of conflict because that's part of their job profession. To agree or disagree with people on their side and people not on their side.
Ahhh... Yeah, that makes sense.
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
I just have struggles communicating certain things so sometimes I get really frustrated when my message happens to be vague.
People around here know me well enough that I don't really mean to be an asshole anyway.
Yeah.
I guess part of it is based on how my world view is at times. I'm not super cynical about it, I'm more so into the idea of "Conflict is kind of a natural thing"
Ahh right
My frustration came from how people expect me to articulate on something that I struggle to elaborate further on. And Rady's smug ass response did not help one bit.
I don't mean to be super pissed off when discussing things, and this was not what I'd hoped to do when talking about something.
Again, sorry for getting frustrated and especially getting smug and jabbing at Rady
Because I need someone to elaborate on things most of the time
I got that curse in full swing, it seems
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Yep
I should've elaborated in saying that "Conflict is something of human nature because everyone thinks differently. No one has the same mindset when it comes to goals or views on certain things."
That's right.
I should just calm down rn
Thanks, Matt. There's an actually useful explanation. Take hints, Rad <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
That smug ass emote doesn't help either
Like, imagine you're dealing with someone who's already pissed off and your first reponse is "You struggle to explain it because you're wrong"
You're not fucking helping
So again, sorry. I can't really articulate my statements further sometimes, so it frustrates me when someone tells me to elaborate cuz I get stuck in a loop of "Ok I'm gonna say this" then it just keeps going back to square one because they ask me to elaborate
I really can't. Because whenever I try, it's probably just gonna devolve into what happened up there.
So to have someone constantly say "Oh that's a recursive question, please elaborate"
Sorry, sometimes I just get mad since sometimes I can't articulate any further
Yeah.
Like how Mel has managed to hit the nail on the head with elaborating on something
I can't elaborate any further cuz I need someone who at least knows what I'm talking about to kind of elaborate for me.
Most people don't know where I'm coming from with something, and when I say something like "People don't think on the same page" I can't necessarily elaborate any further than that cuz when someone asks "Oh hey that's a recursive argument"
It's just frustrating to me because most people know I have a tough time explaining things
<:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
God, ya know what? Fuck it. I'll just say I agree cuz clearly I can't structure MY OWN FUCKING ARGUMENT RIGHT
How people don't agree is that most people tend to have differing thoughts. One person probably doesn't want there to be rights for a certain group of people while one does. Something along those lines.
Fine, I guess I don't know how to fucking talk
Oh
The fact they've put barricades up is pretty scary though
I'm not sure what this case is about. Can anyone summarize?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Oh yeah.
Windows 2000 was when they actually stayed on top of supporting OSes. Otherwise you'd have like 6 years an OS dependent on what you ran. Windows 95 only lasted 6 years, 98 lasted 8 but Microsoft was wanting to axe it in 04. Windows ME only lasted 6.
Microsoft does have a 10 year lifecycle where, save for XP, it is mostly followed.
A lot of people, myself included like it
Well, I suppose Windows 7 was the second coming of XP in a way.
Gimme Windows XP 2, Microsoft. It's not that hard
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
I saw Windows 10 have a lot of buildup
Then dropped it
Honestly Windows 11 didn't have too much buildup as far as I'm concerned. It was leaked, Microsoft did an announcement with it and said, "Hey it'll be out in October."
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
I mean... the laptops I've had all had webcams before, but the forced thing is a lil concerning. Nbd, I usually tape the cam anyway. My laptop has a fancy little clip on it over the camera.
I read that Windows 11 is gonna make webcams necessary to build into all new laptops.
I still get a laugh out of how aggressive the Windows 10 upgrade push was to even news stations doing weather stuff not being safe.
Windows dropping these OSes as free upgrades makes you feel more like the test rat that Microsoft's looking for than you are a consumer just getting a free OS upgrade
The OS didn't even *activate* on the first days, which was ironed out
Boy oh boy, were we in for a bout of driver fuckery.
Remembering when Devin and I upgraded all the laptops in our house that could run it to Windows 10.
I'm not making the jump to 11 at all until at least 10's support is nearing its end
But alas, it's just business stuff
7 is getting extended support which is cool
Windows XP got supported for 14 years which was dope
I think I'll stay on Windows 10 honestly. I hope that they at least make the support thing from 7 something you can do with 10.
It seems to be the right choice for PCs you know probably aren't going to be upgradable to Windows 11 and whatnot
I normally just used Linux on older PCs like a broken down Toshiba we used to have
I have thankfully not had any blue screens when updating my drivers surprisingly
And it only crashes at least once or twice when it feels like it!
Ahhhh
Hell, MacOS itself is built off Unix
Yeah, ain't Android built off Unix or something?
Ahhh
I do like the look of Mint and Ubuntu, but I can understand other distros looking ugly/unappealing
^ That latter one is the biggest issue
I know System76 is one of those Linux manufacturers
Yep!
As for Linux, I wouldn't be surprised if the future offered a bit more options like including Linux on their laptops over Windows. Windows 11 has been the cause of privacy concerns, 10 even more so.
Handheld PCs fascinate me as a fan of things like the Switch and PSP
https://store.ayaneo.com/
We've already seen Windows versions of that
It is kind of cool from the perspective of someone who's always intrigued by portable builds of stuff. Not talking traditional laptop, more like a PC that's built into a portable gaming machine.
Me neither.
Square Enix I really dunno if they'll stay afloat much longer. FF14 is doing great, not sure how much hype people have for FF16 but I can tell it'll prob be hyped a bit.
What can they even make NFTs out of, anyway? I guess Chocobos, and Keyblades
Ehh... better to not get an NFT of JC Denton's sunglasses I suppose
Their decision to sell big properties to Embracer couldn't have been timed better <:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
https://www.wsj.com/articles/nft-sales-are-flatlining-11651552616
I know crypto as a medium is sorta growing, but NFTs themselves I think were always doomed to be trends.
NFT sales dropping to 91% is kind of amusing to me as someone who knew immediately that they would be some sorta trend
I thought that was North Korea
It's okay!
I wasn't even in regular classes until Sophomore year with a modified curriculum.
School systems were very picky with autism growing up
^
Oh mb
Sorry if this seems self-centered, I just feel that people generally never learn *about* themselves since you always learn new things everyday. Be it about yourself or not.
I still find out new things about myself and I'm 20 going 21
As for understanding yourself, I feel that it's not an impossible thing to do, though people do constantly find things out about themselves everyday.
With the advent of the internet, however, we've grown to see more people with the same mental conditions or different ones that understand each other a lot.
I vaguely remember barely passing Psychology in my Senior year. I have an interest in it but I feel about the same.
I have her added if you wish to talk with her.
Very unfortunate.
Their intentions on NFTs could just be realized a lot more soon. The failure of Ubisoft's NFT thing should've been a bit damning that "Hey, maybe we should take a step back."
It is very funny.
Square Enix still has plenty of franchises to keep afloat. FF14 is one of the most profitable MMOs in years for one.
Yeah
Anything can fail pretty hard then have some sorta attempt that makes them prominent
That's true
And that really flopped
Get ready for FF14 NFTs that are exclusive armor for-

Oh wait. Ubisoft already tried that.
Or, will exist
Kingdom Hearts 4 exists
How a country with no naval experience manages to sink a ship is just too amazing
Ukraine's been wiping the floor with Russia to say the least. Or, at least that's what it appears to be like from the news I've seen here.
^
I don't think Russia vs. Ukraine would be enough to start a third world war.
In what sense?
Hey, at the end of the day that's one chapter of my life I left closed. Plenty of new ones are gonna be rising everyday.
I know new generations always usurp the old but I saw people I hung out with and greatly was acquainted with dip or become inactive in the span of no time.
They did understand and I'm still buddy buddy with all the staff, I just felt that it really fell off as a place for me to be a regular in because a lot of the people I knew left or were super inactive.
It was one of those decisions I thought over for awhile and honestly it really sucks since it was the server where my redemption arc grew.
So earlier today I retired from and departed WEPcord, a place that meant plenty to me. Mainly due to feeling that moderating the server had no point. A lot of my activity fell off and everything after WEP aired its special.

Return to AOL chatrooms
You don't see Facebook asking for $5/mo. just to send friend requests and socialize regularly
$3.00/mo. isn't too bad, but it was a free social media platform.
On the main topic, yeah. Twitter possibly being paid could be a stubborn plan.
<:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073> I probably have a bit to work on don't I
I shouldn't have been so hostile about it anyway
It's ok
Because it seems like most people don't pick up when I'm joking or being sarcastic sometimes.
Do I *need* to start using fucking tone indicators?
You're fine.
<:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417>
**How the fuck could you not tell I was joking**
Yeah, that's what I was joking about
Where's my check, then?
I always find teacher insights to be the most interesting because you see kids going from one app to another in real time
Ahhh, interesting.
I was thinking about the former. How long a "popular" crowd would follow it
Yep.
Would you say around 5 or 6 years at best? Maybe a little less?
Trends in general are always one thing replacing the next. Facebook replaced Myspace, then Facebook's the uncool thing and now Twitter's the new cool thing. Instagram still somewhat thrives while FB isn't the cool new thing. Then TikTok is suddenly the cool new thing.
So... how long would you say a social media platform lasts in relevancy?
What's Russia gonna do? Send over Russians in Flintstones cars?
But I'm interested to see where this heads

Lowering protections from 95 to 56 would probably mean by 2033, Star Wars would potentially be legal grounds
Hell, before you became a senior they'd ask you to get a meningitis shot.
That's very reassuring. I can only hope that the other students got a vaccination. I remember getting a flu shot and stuff was **required** in HS
Even got the booster.
Yes.
It's been 2 years. I can kind of expect things to slowly get back to normal.
So my little brother is heading into HS next year instead of doing online learning. Is COVID at a point where things might be a bit safer?
I am once again in need of-
I think you should ask if your club could have you on certain days. Just to make your schedule a lot less stressful than it is.

Printfriendly.com is also an option

Ntm when I buy a game I try to make it last awhile so I'm not buying much. Most of the time I gotta run the price of a game through my mom and she's fine.
Wipes, toothpaste, deodorant, shirts, etc.
I have my own account but mom afaik manages it. Normally I buy games and stuff if I really want one, but for the most part I spend the month's earnings at places like Target and other stores buying things I need
That's galaxy brained
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Hell, maybe I could start doing writing commissions? Idk.
I'd contemplated YouTube but eh.
Hell, I'd love to at least buy myself a PC or two off eBay and see how far I can repair 'em.
I'm def going to begin studying PC refurbishing more.
Yeah.
I'd love to do something like that
I have been looking into computer repair a bit more due to my job from the Summer a few years ago (2019)
That and I'm just bored of staying at home and clearing my log of games/anime/etc.
I don't wanna live off just my social security income at the end of the day.
Nah, but that sounds tantilizing
That's kind of why I wanna get a job
Yep.
I recall my mom mentioning that the board thing that I was on for people with disabilities closed my case. Maybe we could reopen it? Idk.
I am. I just have issues where it comes to self-deprecation
I've been trying
I wasn't necessarily angry, that's just me being stupid like I always am.
It was something minor admittedly, I just spoke poorly
I just wasn't very happy that a subject I wanted to keep in one channel leaked into <#336297387863703552> of all places
Idk, I wasn't super angry beforehand

Time for Blockbuster to make a comeback üòé
Ooh
Yeah it's nuts. Activision-Blizzard always has to do something to divert people's attention
He's around 83 or 84 iirc
So I have been hearing Grandpa lately is having a lot of issues, the dementia itself is easily the worst of it.
Yeah this was directed towards him
I literally brought up my problem in a specific channel, even thinking it was ya know... not even safe here either. And my trust felt a little violated after the jab at that today.
In conclusion to how my topic started, I think that for future reference if I say something in one channel, I don't expect it to be brought up elsewhere that's "safe"
Since I'm an adult
Apparently I also have to pay the maintenance fee per month
That's kinda nice
Because she and dad are getting old, she's given us a place to fall back on
At least, Devin owns it
She also told me that the apartment I've been in since 2008 is technically our house now

Ahhh true. Fox news is nutty in general.
He's such a nutbag. I'm amazed he hasn't been fired or anything.
Or, just so often to the point where it doesn't shock like Columbine
You always hear about a shooting in America everyday
I don't blame you.
The most I've seen officers at is in my high school. They really strengthened up the amount of officers there after Parkland.
There's probably a few greeters out in the front or something, but not an entire task squad of officers.
Ah. That'd make sense given most supermarkets don't have security that much from what I've seen whenever I go out.
Yeah... I've no idea why specifically supermarkets. Is it the amount of people there?
2 shootings in 2 days, damn.

Are these all people reacting to the NFT stock fall?

Netflix gutting their animation department was the last nail for me. It's such a shame since they were also working on a Bone adaptation.
Good for him
Devin's having a job interview atm <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
She's so happy
Working for Discover taking calls for them
Speaking of, she also got a potential really good job offer
So she's well aware of the scammers
Cuz mom's done job searching before
He has double, hell triple checked
Though I normally get the mornings unless Conner hops on in between school breaks
That and I just get more time on the computer in general <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
He doesn't have a heart condition, but mom was all afraid of the virus and all, so she never really wanted us to leave unless it was super important
He had nothing to really do after graduating in 2018. And when 'rona hit, he was pretty much homebound just like me.
So happy for him tbh
So they're advancing with the interview.
But that's cuz the system bugged out
Though he's getting an email that says he was "disapproved" for it, the guy said
He's going to be getting it.
Free health insurance and whatnot, that's super nice.
The job he signed up for
Apparently Devin's gonna be getting a lot of good benefits from it.
I'm probably misreading a bit of this, but were you wearing a mask as you entered the hallway or something?
Not to strike fear into you or anything, I just feel this is something very small to get *that* upset about.
If you were going to nearly do it, imagine if you actually went that extra step
^
That's incredibly concerning. What'd they even do?
That's... scary.
What could you mean by that?
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Something about helping kids as he has a diploma for helping out kindergartners and everything
It's nice since I hear mom might be doing more stay at home stuff but he'll be going out someplace for work
Yep
And how big of a mistake it was to invade them during the winter
I remember reading about them in history during my sophomore year
Was the Russian military always this bad?
Again, I'm not the most aware of stuff going on since I don't pay too much attention to the news. But I've been amused by how Russia as a whole has been throughout the conflict. Mainly because they aren't as strong as they thought they were.
Not a huge surprise, but knowing how Russia's been this whole war, I expect them to do not much.
What will the consequences be for Sweden and Finland joining NATO from the Russian standpoint?
Ahhh.
On another note, I haven't been keeping up with Russia/Ukraine stuff lately but I heard about the possibility of NATO having Finland sign on
It doesn't really work.
It's like when you say "Calm down" to someone who's already angry
Kinda does the opposite honestly.
I just have difficulty whenever I get something wrong. Now, of course geography isn't something I'm super passionate about. But it's still a little annoying to me because idk, the way specific things are delivered. And telling someone "Don't even start"
Again, sorry
I should stop being so overly-annoyed about it
Everyone gets things wrong sometimes ig
I'm just not fond of being told I'm wrong about things I guess. It's not like I hate being wrong, it's moreso how I handle getting something incorrect
Sorry
What? Can't self-deprecate?
That's just a trademark of mine I suppose.
I never get anything right, do I?

Is it safe to call it "South America" since I remember learning North America/South America/Europe/Asia in school
North America refers to the United States
There's "North" and "South" America for a reason
Falling dreams represent you feeling your life is out of control from what I've read. Haven't had one of those in years, but I'm just overall curious if there is anything that does happen if you were to just not wake up before impact. Does this send any signals to your brain?
If anyone's had those dreams where you fall but wake up before the impact of said fall, is it possible to see out what happens afterward?
I haven't had these kind of dreams lately, but I'm curious
If I could add a <:HibikiDab:688190074395164696> reaction I would
That makes a lot of sense as to why things aren't going too hot on their fronts.
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
Not sure if there ever has been one. I thought I remember seeing something for a 3DS, but I'm unsure why people would develop malware for consoles
Now I wonder, has there ever been a virus made for game consoles?
Pardon my rambling, I'm just super intrigued to know ransomware is still at large.
The only things I've seen small talk of is adware, but that's more of an annoyance than it is super serious
It's understandable why things like CIH probably wouldn't exist nowadays. As virus authors realize there is more to be earned than having some schmuck misread an exe file and having their PC be rendered unbootable.
But you're definitely seeing people store tons of personal info on PCs more than they would've in, say, the late 00s
Not like they weren't before
That's probably why ransomware is a lot more common. People are beginning to rely on technology more and more to hold sensitive information.
Yeah
Interesting to know ransomware is still huge in 2022, but that's probably the fault of most things being digital
Since I'd never really hear about virus related things as I haven't been following PC security things as much as I used to.
Yeah, I knew it was a stupid question but I was just curious
Ahhh
I don't hear too much nowadays about specific super dangerous viruses unless it's ransomware
Do y'all think computer viruses/malware are as big as they once were?
I recall our teacher showing us a video detailing that
From what I vaguely remember hearing about in my ethics class in Senior year, they were pretty much still one of the harshest places towards women and LGBT.
Yeah.
Dress codes, gender segregation
Saudi Arabian women also are limited
Well, homophobic yes. Idk about transphobic, but being gay is apparently a crime in Saudi Arabia.
Being LGBT in Saudi Arabia is an extreme crime for one. Which is shocking in its own right.
I'm not as politically aware of things at times, but I know that Saudi Arabia has bought out SNK like the article mentions and know plenty of people who are against them digging into big companies due to how controversial SA is.
Hm... intriguing.

Aside the fugly look, there's it being tied to your account
This is why NFTs as a whole don't work as a concept, especially with productions involving them
It'll be tried again in a few years

Bad luck for the family this week.
Devin also unfortunately didn't land his job either
I can only hope she can find another
"Hey you got the job. Sike! You don't have enough experience!"
Yeah I have no idea why
By the same place that was going to hire
She was told today she "Didn't have enough experience"
When she thought she was going to be hired, given they said, "You have the job."
Mom told us some very disappointing news
LOL
This is the third deadliest shooting in the US now, behind V-Tech and Sandy Hook
I don't mean to sound cynical or anything, I'm just frustrated with how lawmakers haven't passed some sort of law to control weapons.
It's appalling we've been having shootings that are consistently occurring over the past few years. You'd think after Columbine we'd have some gun laws passed, but no.
Nothing's stopping you from picking up your dad or your grandpa's gun and shooting a place up. Hell, the kid who shot the school up was 18. And like most shooters, they decided to kill themselves before facing the consequences.
> ‚ÄúNeither the Constitution, nor state law, impose a general duty upon police officers or other governmental officials to protect individual persons from harm ‚Äî even when they know the harm will occur,‚Äù said Darren L. Hutchinson, a professor and associate dean at the University of Florida School of Law. ‚ÄúPolice can watch someone attack you, refuse to intervene and not violate the Constitution.‚Äù

Yep.
Look at where those elementary school teachings went.

It's funny, growing up I was always told "Cops help people"
I always find it disturbing of me to say "I'm used to this."
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
I know that.
<:MariaDefeated:688429716780089397>
We've had so many shootings in the past while, it's kind of baffling how little gun control gets addressed.
Though I doubt it'll change much. Not to sound pessimistic, I'm just aware that with how many shootings there are, the gun laws won't change much
I can only hope this is enough to actually start putting more gun laws in place

It's been awhile and my way of describing things isn't the best, but I recall them discussing how to use those and hiding under the desk.
It was this little plastic barricade with a small metal bar you'd put into the floor, something along those lines.
When Stoneman Douglas happened, I remember the next year of High School the teachers were showing us what to do with the door barricades and whatnot

A line of children's chairs, then two chairs for the teachers that died.
Speaking of the shooting, mom told me that the local church across from the middle school put on a touching display.
Yeah that too
You hear about a shooting happening every week it seems.
That'd mean a majority of cops wouldn't have 'em though so <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
To think gun violence could easily be solved if we didn't give them to people with a domestic abuse report on their record.

A lot of channels we used to have on the base package were having to be paid for. No wonder everyone has or is planning on jumping the streaming boat
It was an experience. No Nickelodeon, Cartoon Network, etc.
Thinking of cable reminds me of the time we got it once a few years ago. This was 2019 iirc?
We decided to drop Netflix because there wasn't anything interesting on there
The only ones we're subscribed to are Disney+, HBO Max, and Amazon Prime Video

I've got such an odd perfectionist mindset at the same time, however. But I'll get things to work!
Hey, I can acknowledge "Yeah I make mistakes, that just happens."
But it's something I could easily shrug off. I've just been stupidly moody lately for no reason.
My perfectionism is my downfall.
But in my Senior year I got A's, B's , and C's in most of my final classes but was fine
And admittedly this was something I had an issue with as a kid. I wanted to get good grades and especially get A+'s in school
It is.
Yes.
It's one of those things I'm gonna prob just shrug off, but I've come to realize it has been mildly annoying to most members.
It feels like recently I haven't been the person I was. A lot of getting upset over small things and all.
Guess I tend to self-flagellate a lot, eh?
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
That seems generally obvious, though. Whenever I see a company change to pride flag, especially a big one like Disney, I'm reminded of some of their biggest pushes against LGBT

Veteran's Month
I pointed out how there's specific months like Autism Awareness Month in April, Black History Month in February, etc.
My eyes rolled so far into the back of my head
So my little brother and I were watching a video where they mentioned pride month, and he turns to me and says, "I don't mean to sound like a jerk but I don't think we need a whole month for this"
Devin is also facing pressure in finding a job

I did have egotism in school. I always had to do great on tests and stuff. But I kinda ran that off during my later years.
Mhm... that's true.
Probably the lack of self-confidence whenever I get something wrong?
Y'all are very nice to me so I generally should try nipping this on the bud. I've been on and off as of late, and I can't quite place my finger on why.

Such a fucking embarrassment
Which means to say they flat out destroyed the elementary school and built a new one
That's the word they used in the article
Stoneman Douglas made a new building on campus with safety features, Sandy Hook was razed and reconstructed, opening a new building in 2016. Vtech's Norris hall where the shooting took place was renovated, and Columbine just stayed open.
TL;DR After the massacre, the article compares examples relating to other shootings and how they handled reworking their buildings
https://www.npr.org/2022/06/01/1102248213/uvalde-robb-elementary-rebuild-parkland-sandy-hook-columbine

Knowing what's at stake, I will not speak of my past again.
Besides, I've a Xenosaga playthrough and Trails to experience
Indeed.
I hate knowing it's come to this, but given how long it was going on, I will commit to fully moving on.
Given what's on the line, it will be.
Last thing I would want to do is have the place I worked so hard to get back into pulled under from me.
Again, I apologize for this behavior being so recurring.
Maybe I should
Yessss
<:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>

Thanks to everyone who's been trying to push me in the right direction. I'm sure this Summer will mark a turning point with all of this.
Hopefully this Summer is the push I need to stop brooding.
The last thing the world needs is EdgeDas
Perhaps my bitterness will subside in due time. But I always say that.
Thanks.
At first I was happy to be here. Now it's more of a... "Wow, you fucked up hard, huh?"
Like... it didn't feel like it was my initial first join. Like how Lily Rose has joined once, or how most people have joined at least once. I'm just... I have no idea how to process it.
I'm just a little irritated at the thought of feeling like I was already here and that my presence when I got the opportunity to rejoin feels a bit... odd. Like hey, here's that guy who's been here before and was a notably toxic asshat that got booted. But he's cooled off now and it's ok!
Sorry. I'll cool off.
But even then, I feel conflicted.
It was a seemingly impossible task. Given I hear no one was unbanned before. I'm kind of the first, and I should really embrace that.
I know I underestimate this shit a lot, but it's still very annoying to me.
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
Did they not fucking believe that maybe the toxic asshole actually found time to mellow out?
I get it was several fucking months after my whole outburst, but **really?**
And that's where my salt comes from.
But I got rejected.
There was also the fact I wanted to be back here in November 2020, I know that it was a few months after and all. But I was excited to be rewatching Symphogear and wanted a place to share my experiences with the then-unwatched AXZ and XV...
I've heard that before... but I'm just still very mad.
Yeah. A surprise impossible miracle.
No shit.
Still, I hate knowing it took so long.
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
Mhm...
I suppose it was just knowing the same time I knew Melua that i apparently wasn't trusted enough to pop in for events like <a:Susphogear:826967918548877382> and Kirika's birthday thing that happens every year felt... depressing.
Hm... true.
Knowing that in the time I was gone I've missed cool events and all. And it's all because I fucked up.
But overall I'm just always going to feel so... upset about this. Knowing I could've been here before.
I like being here but I'm still so mildly annoyed knowing that it took too goddamn long.
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
I feel as if when I finally rejoined, it wasn't a huge triumphant moment. No. It was more of a "Hey, you're late to the party but here's a hat just for bothering to show up."
For one, there's the whole "If only I were here 2 years ago" shit
I can do it a lot nicer than a few years ago but I'm still just a little upset with a few things.
Idk why the process of moving on is so hard for me.
Is knowing I never did anything to them.
My biggest issue with this
Fine.
When I didn't even do anything to them
ESPECIALLY
I'm just disappointed knowing my anger broke a friendship that badly.
Sorry.
I'm pissed and want to vent. What's the big fucking deal?
Yeah whatever.
Idk why either. I've been pinging her for art and the likes and I thought we were on a good path.
I can't believe I fucked up that badly.
I'm a failure. A disappointment to many.

How so?
What kind of games would even be developed for this console?
And NFTs in general are already pretty ridiculed
Normally don't get far
If the Ouya is anything to go off of, these kinds of "indie" consoles
Absolutely would decimate this
Or whatever?
If they took down Mario Kart NFTs?
https://twitter.com/MarParNews/status/1544077669318418434
Implying there's more than just a render of a controller and console
Which I imagine may as well be the fate of this NFT console.
Like the PlayStation classic, it was resurrected as an emulation device.
The Ouya itself was a glorified android box with a cheaply built controller
I was surprised to see Rerez cover it awhile back but hey, their content dissecting games and consoles are pretty entertaining
But their marketing for it was abysmal. Trade shows especially the CEO was talking out of her ass about things.
They did get past the crowdfunding stage
Yeah I was thinking of Ouya too when I first saw this
This time, however, you can just take the money and run when you please.
And here we are at NFTs, full circle once again.
Reminds me of Kickstarter and the various game and console scams I saw on there
The idea of "Hey, let's buy NFTs for a console we have only two renders of"
Make that goofy NFT fighting game people were doing with ugly UE4 ape assets
It's like Microsoft and Sony had a one night stand and out shat this
Look at this controller too
Can imagine content creators would have a field day tearing it a part like Stadia and Ouya before it though
Am scratching my head on the idea of the console itself
Has the mindset of "Hey this ape is worth a bunch of money" I suppose
Ahhhh
But idk how they'd exactly do anything
I'd like an explanation as to how NFT games would work though. I know the process would be paying with ETH or something
üôè
Goddamn joke police
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
I was trying to make a relevant joke
I'm... aware...

Yeah idk how they'd do NFT games
Now it's both?

That was popular in school for awhile
It was eh... a thing
Yeah
And seeing bathrooms locked up because those were the spots for juuling
But boy do I have stories of being in my Sophomore year of HS and seeing people get called down to in school suspension (read: fancy way of saying detention) in droves
I didn't know they were doing the whole "Targeting kids" aspect demographic wise
Huh, I remember when this kind of thing was big in my Sophomore year

Movie industries tend to run like a machine nowadays. Even the behind the scenes stuff meant to be fun even feels corporate and soulless.
Yeah...
I hate to imagine what it's like working on Marvel and Star Wars ones the most
Star Wars, Marvel, they own 20th Century Fox as well
Yep.
Disney treats Marvel like a machine already. I'm not very shocked that even the movie industry is rife with overworked employees and seemingly impossible deadlines
Twitter seems to make everything insanely stubborn and hard to work with
They'd only ease into it after awhile, but even then the thought of driving around a 1 ton death machine on wheels is pretty nerve-racking.
Like Iski said, there's probably anxiety when you start driving. I recall when I used to take a van home during my school years that one of the drivers mentioned they had to keep the radio off, eyes focused on the road, etc.
With the way I drive in video games and how I have focusing issues as is, I'm afraid of even going behind the wheel
BMW executives got drunk and decided their ideas on Forza or some car creator game were good enough to be produced

You spend like what? Thousands on your car?
> We‚Äôve asked BMW for the exact details of this roll-out, but it was unable to say when the subscriptions had been launched in which countries. It‚Äôs no surprise that BMW isn‚Äôt trumpeting the news, though.

IoT is something I vaguely remember hearing about in the early 2010s but was of course a kiddo at the time, but the idea of a wifi powered thing sounded cool!
The first mistake was buying an HP printer lmao
Did I tell you the story of the time I had to print something out for Devin using the HP printer dad just bought?
IoT is such a goofy thing cuz even the most mundane shit you have to have an account for to use
But dad never uses the app for that
We have one of those "smart ovens" where you can heat it from your phone and shit, and a laundry machine

I was incredibly embarrassed to go outside because of some anxiety where I'd think, "People are gonna point out me missing my top teeth"
I've been missing most of my top teeth for months, so I'm very happy with this

Hell, there's a death of someone I knew that was a teacher in HS and that case still hasn't been solved.
Yeah I'm surprised Ohio isn't on there. Though where I live isn't super crime heavy or anything, I can still see shit wrong with it. Like that anti-trans sports thing from awhile ago.

Noticed yesterday that I had these periods of doing... nothing. Just taking a tiny nap for whatever reason.
Been contemplating setting clocks on my phone for specific parts of the day again like I did months ago. Do y'all think this is a good idea? Does living life through some schedule sound like a means to start getting into a decent enough headspace or routine?
You can always visit. If you don't have vulnerabilities to airborne diseases or anything. Because I remember I could never visit mine because of that.
<:ElsaPat:637356110415659063>
I'd be very skeptical. I remember when my dad's dad was brought to a nursing home, they treated him rather terribly. Sorry if I'm scaring you, I just... don't trust nursing home as much because of that.

Humorously enough, we were the first generation to graduate during a pandemic.
6th grade we were the last generation to graduate from that specific intermediate school
It was just 5th and 6th grade for me, but I do remember them saying something along the lines of us being the last to do it. They were hyping us up as the last generation of students to do something.
I think that's why when I was in 7th/8th grade (2013/14) we'd start seeing less of DARE and more of the generic "Stop bullying" campaigns with ads about cyberbullying
Growing up I never realized how it came across more as the feds stroking themselves off than it did teaching kids about drug use.
<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Yep...
But when I was in 5th/6th grade I could definitely see the remnants of that program failing. Even during my high school years of 2016-20 I could still see people using old-new stock DARE related things like mousepads or water bottles.
Cuz all we did was something similar to the weeks worth of lectures, but no lion or anything. The DARE program itself is odd because you look at it now and realize how using police to tell people drugs are bad is a stubborn scare tactic. And you're being taught the various names, slang, etc.
I remember being in this program, but it was very cut down for my generation
Huh
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aR8sDMjZ-KQ
Oh... right.
I learned about the Civil War and slavery in 8th!

<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Who knows where the streaming industry will be in the next few years? Soon enough, we'll probably have entire series subconsciously uploaded into our heads.
We're talking about the same corporation that owns 20th Century Fox, Lucasfilm, all the properties that come with those, and plenty of other companies I couldn't possibly name all of.
I'd say that's to be expected eventually. Like I said, it's similar to how they demolished Blockbuster. Though when you're competing in a market with Disney of all companies, you're bound to lose.
Though that's due to other companies capitalizing on the market Netflix dominated, like how Netflix usurped Blockbuster.
Netflix has been making stubborn move after stubborn move, and while I hear Stranger Things is at least the one thing keeping it afloat, it's not a controversial thing to say their library really isn't what it used to be.
Yep. A lot of it happens to do with business decisions like family sharing being something they're trying to prevent, or the animation department getting fucked over.
And I feel that's probably why I want to have some sorta schedule again. So I'm always going to have something to do instead of procrastinate. Like write or watch anime.
MSN? Haven't seen that in years

I was just having a normal chat with a friend while watching them play a game
I didn't say anything weird
It's like... what?
All I was doing was talking with a friend while she was playing a game
WTF IS THERE TO BE WORRIED ABOUT WITH YOUR 20 YEAR OLD FUCKING SON
I messaged Devin about it and he says, "She's worried about you"
Last night was talking with a friend on Discord and mom was like... all up in my business for no reason. She asks me who I was talking to, I just said a friend. Afterwad, she sends my older brother up there to get more details and it's like fuck off.

Before we know it, he might be going into work next week all good.
It's good to know it isn't *that* severe
||Oh god||
Hopefully his work doesn't get on his back for not showing up 2 days of the week
I shall!
(CW: Gross) ||He was shitting blood, which is probably why they would do it||
But Devin was in a *lot* of pain
Apparently it's a severe one? I dunno
He had to visit the ER and meet a gastrologist today
Yes
It isn't, I think it's just to help him out. As he does have meds.
Though he's having to drink this cranberry thing that helps him with bowel movements
Medicine
Turns out he might have a hemorrhoid. Poor lad.
Unsure. All I know is he's ok. We might find out when he gets home.
Update: Just got a text he's okay!
Didn't think he'd have his first sick day so soon.
I'm worried.
üôè
Devin's been sick these past few days. Apparently it's CAT scan worthy too.
Huh.

Looks like they did it again. And dad heard about it on the police radio and as we were going by old school on our way to my appointment.
Remember a few weeks ago when I said there were police up at that old intermediate school that's not used, using it to train for shootings?
Let's just say I did fear going out in public for whatever reason due to my top teeth all not being there.
Even then, actually having a full row of teeth gives me the confidence to go out more.
I have to take them off every night
These new teeth aren't proper implants, per se.
They're gonna have me come in for getting that all setup, then a month or two later I'll be given one more dental cleaning.
I'd also like to apologize for my behavior for the past few months, as I was really genuinely not kind to a lot of people here. But things are looking far better now, especially hearing news like that.
Hearing that I'm getting new dental implants is probably the happiest I've been for a long time

Precisely. We are still living in a society where that stereotype is still prominent unfortunately.
Idk what the stigma of a guy being a preschool teacher is. Devin's worked with kids before and is very approachable. Guessing it's just some stigma parents have? Especially since this is one of those "fancy" preschools
This same preschool also is fancy shmancy with these kids that act like Karens for no reason

But then ED users said that the Chris-Chan article was too big for its own good, hence the existence of the CWCki. In general, ED is a site where, like Kiwifarms, it covers "lulcows" and other topics under the guise of satire.
Encyclopedia Dramatica is a "satire" website that was primarily where the Chris-Chan article was hosted
ED is constantly having to swap hosts as well, and at this point has entirely disappeared off Google and the likes
That'd be a historic day since Kiwi is probably the one remaining remnant of a site like Encyclopedia Dramatica
Honestly would be amazed to see Cloudflare drop Kiwifarms
Holy shit
At this point I've totally seen plenty use it, it's one of those few YouTube sponsors that's actually meaningful

I've typed "Youo" too many times
Mainly when I type you
Idk why but my keyboard is one hell of a fan of forgetting letters or adding an extra random letter
So getting opportunities like this upcoming job
I guess to me my frustration is the fact that I have no real friends IRL to hang out with. I even wiped my Facebook from the face of the Earth.
The best thing about that is since we know the person behind this program personally, it'd make me getting this opportunity better
So I'm planning on contacting them.
Just remembered an old program I used to do has this "adult learning center" for post-HS people that I could possibly volunteer at. They're tied to disability services and all, and it'd help me actually socialize
I could possibly consider that, especially getting something basic for my grandma she won't mess up.
Oh true
I wanna work!
I don't wanna be tied to social security for the rest of my fucking life
And I think that's the part that pisses me off.
My parents issue here is that I cannot get a job because then it'd cut into the social security funds and they'd pull out.

I love that kinda thing

It's mildly amusing seeing Republicans calling trans people pedophiles, but yet...

Aw man, Xenosaga is woke because Shion is a w*men protagonist
Woke as a term is so fucking stupid
G*mer moment
It's a scary thought.
134 degrees was the record in 1913. Wonder if global warming being as crazy as it is will see that record be broken.

Yeah dropping it due to death threats instead of the doxxing and multiple suicides is eh...

Reading this over, I wonder as to why a law like that doesn't exist in the US. That, or it does, but it's not enforced as heavily.
Null out here clutching his pearls
Yes
Only to, in their half-assed apology, say that they're disappointed in the fans instead of owing up to it
It's like an influencer being called out by other channels for harassing someone and getting their fans to go after them...
Null is an alt-right asshat himself, so I'm not surprised he's trying to shift the blame
Pathetic.
He's expecting sympathy? After people have taken their lives and the recent Keffals situation?

Though I'm in the clear since all the art I get is mainly Xenosaga, Symphogear, and other stuff
But still
Hopefully people start calling Pixiv out for it. I know this is a Japanese website and, like Millhi said, they have a bad track record for caring about the western part of it
There's already the whole trans person getting harassed by management thing iirc
And knowing how messed up Pixiv is internally atm that's bad
Ok, that's just beyond fucked up
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
Ok, that's just beyond fucked up
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299> Whaaaat
I think they mean western artists are heading over to Pixiv now and posting their art there because of sites like DeviantArt and others cracking down on it
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
I think I vaguely recall seeing Null taunt that "We have backups if one takes us down"
"Wait, .ru? DId they really go there now?"

Than the provider itself doing it
I'm saying that it's the sad truth that it takes people to pressure a provider into closing a harmful site down
You read it wrong
Oh absolutely
Ahhh, that's the sad truth.
At what point did they think, maybe, after victims were harassed into taking their own life and they were in the midst of hunting down a transwoman that they wouldn't have their site closed?
This was a long time coming. They setup this forum initially to troll Chris-Chan, and then it blew up into its own place for them to "milk lulcows"
I'm waiting for that Wikipedia page to read "was" instead of "is" kekw

Selling a phone without a charger is such a strange concept anyway. I know things like Bluetooth chargers exist but it's pretty sucky to parts of the world where these things will be way more expensive
Yeah, it's not a wise decision to remove chargers from a phone being sold in a place that's already got a very rough economy. I have a good friend who lives there and they've talked about how rough it is.
This is a headline I read.

Given I'm not as knowledgeable about the world and kind of avoid diving into politics as much as I can
^ I think that's how I feel
Like how creepy Prince Andrew is
I remember my mom was a huge fan, idk how to feel myself and I'm on the same page of not knowing much about the political system outside of knowing about a few controversies involving other members of the royal family
Oh absolutely
Yep.
Then again I always have problems communicating it seems...
That's what I was getting at
^
Oh yeah
I was aware that she was suffering medical problems, I think I should prob sit this one out <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
Uninformed?
But uh yeah, apologies for perhaps sounding a bit... I dunno the precise word
It's one of those events that was bound to happen but you never knew when if you get what I'm saying. I don't mean this to be offensive or anything.
So if anything it's more shocking to me knowing it happened, even if it was seemingly inevitable.
I was aware she had health problems and all.
I'm eh... Not the best at wording myself properly.
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> Sorry if I'm seeming stupid about all of this
And got COVID at one point, which definitely didn't help with her health problems
Oh yeah I'm aware
I know. I'm just kinda shocked. Damn, to think this was one of the longest living rulers of any nation and they're just dead now. Then again most of us are like teens, in our early 20s, etc. So we might have seen bigger deaths. But this is the Queen of England.
Wow, I never thought this would happen so soon.

Whoa...
I was so focused on Xenosaga I didn't check the channel

I dunno what the hell is up with me today
Ty!
Actually popping off the dentures is good. I don't feel like I'm having to do tug of war
I think dad and I might shave that, but the only thing we shaved today has been my beard and stuff because I needed it to be less hairy so the dentists could help
ü§ù
What I really like is there's small corners to help with the teeth that are actually up there
Getting used to speaking with them is a neat thing I suppose. Does require a bit of practice since my brain thinks it's some foreign object.
Alright, so I got a pic of them
Just me being annoyed
No...?
?
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
Losing most of your teeth at 20, mainly top teeth, really sucks.
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
Now I feel a lot less anxious.
Feels really good after all this time to finally have those dentures. I've been moody for awhile for various reasons, and that was definitely one of them. Lacking proper teeth. I had a bit of social anxiety, mainly because I was kind of embarrassed to go out into IRL stuff without them.

Looks like Devin isn't sick per se, but he is being monitored.
Older brother
Mom did tell my little brother and I to keep distance just in case.
I'm hoping he isn't positive.
But they sent Devin home mainly as an act of precaution since he was in contact with those two teachers
He **might** have COVID, but one of the tests came back positive.
Mom is also working an online job where she contacts COVID-positive people and talks with them.
Yes.
Thank you. I hope, too.

Yep. I don't watch too many eSports but even then, the last person you wanna party with or want to flex partying with is someone that's got sex trafficking allegations
But that's the most I've heard about Tate since he got banned from every possible social media platform
There's been controversy with another creator. An eSports company owner was seen partying with the Tates... And doubled down when people called him out for it. So one of the biggest eSports teams got fucked over in one night
I remember seeing them try for 3.0 but thanks to Tate getting banned off every feasible platform he probably aborted that idea
Yep. Then the 2.0 thing happened.
Which is a glorified Discord server with a huge price tag
Didn't he stop running the cam girl business after admitting it was a scam just to push his Hustlers University thing
^
Which is, ya know, pretty suspicious already.
Yeah. Lives in Romania, masking it as him wanting to get away from the "MeToo" movement
I hope that happens to Tate next
Jones got booted off all platforms just like Tate, and the former is losing millions in court lol

It's so funny to me that people who use those terms are still taking parts of YouTube over, albeit the alt-right pipeline isn't as strong as it was in the early years
Yep.
"Woke" and "SJW" are the most overused, stubborn terms
"Woke" is a word that's gotten so overused by the right I take anyone who uses it not at all seriously

You didn't hear?
After inciting people to bomb hospitals for LGBT rights, honestly I would've pulled the trigger then
Why have they not been suspended permanently though?
I don't go near Twitter with a ten foot pole, don't even have an account, I just find it appalling you have an account like this still going. And it's been suspended several times... but never permanently.
Libs of TikTok not being permanently suspended is beyond me. You have some chick who's spreading around misinformed stories that rattle the bee hive of Fox News or Daily Wire. And these stories have actively lead to harmful incidents like the drag queen thing being stopped by the Proud Boys or the bomb threats to a hospital mentioned in the video. It's so appalling Twitter accounts like that stay up.

Dunno if that means I should patch up my head, but owie I don't recommend doing that!
It's been months in the making. But I'm confident I'll do it. After all this time and banging my head against the wall, I've made it crack.
So yes, starting tomorrow I'll be nipping this on the bud. But I know words aren't enough for proof, so I look forward to finally closing the book on this.
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I promise after this I'll not bring this up again.
Ok, thank you.
Now I'm going to rip it out.
I'm genuinely happy now that I've finally, after all this time, found that inner demon.
Now that I've found the hydra, it's time to decapitate it.
No, you can react to XV now.
Again, pardon if I'm filling the channel up.
So whenever I see someone watching both for the first time... I do get a little sad inside knowing I could have done the same.
But let's just say my primary trigger for frustration is remembering that I'd wanted to be here for my first time watches of AXZ and XV.
I'm admittedly disgusted admitting who I once was.
As months prior, I had been an incredibly toxic person and was justly booted. In all honesty I was terribly transphobic and do understand why moderation turned down to let me in during late November.
My full story being that around the time I wanted to come back (late November 2020) I had started rewatching prior seasons of Gear before the other 2 just to get myself all refreshed and ready. By that time, I was wanting to share my thoughts on it as I went along with not just friends, but others who I wanted to get back on the right foot with.
This envy correlating with that decision 2 years ago. I know it's a thing I've repeated ad nauseum by this point, but understand I'm not going to bash moderation. If anything, I understand their decisions.
My main source of frustration I've mentioned is that I feel a tinge of envy whenever I see someone live reacting to AXZ or XV. Again, this is not a vent, just me pointing out things I've taken mental notes of.
Don't want to vent about it here, just wanted to say I may be close to finally nipping my issues on the bud
I think visualizing a situation and thinking about how it could have gone worse is certainly one step that's helping.
All I knew was I dwelled on negative thoughts

But overall they fell off of interest for me, even as a person who likes Halo. Did really like the older RvB stuff, at least up to the seasons after Oum left to work on RWBY
Don't think I've watched them in years. Maybe an Achievement Hunter vid or two
And Rooster Teeth was a euphenism for an insult from Red vs. Blue, literally "cockbite"
Literally changed to "Rooster Teeth" because their prior name, "Drunk Tank" wasn't picking up any game copies from publishers when reviewing it.

Having it be nothing more than a vague "Hey I'm gonna start blocking people who ask" is shitty
At times like this, it comes back to bite him in the ass since you really *need* to issue a statement about this kinda thing.
But now he's on full lockdown
Hideki Kamiya blocking people was at first a meme, and like Iski said that 101 stretch goal was a thing
You're all in the right, I really shouldn't have gotten so worked up over this.
I should just take a step back. Reflect.
Just like how I shouldn't ruin my standing digging my heels over a bad take
I'll back off from posting in <#336297840529899522>. Just lurk. Your point is clear. I shouldn't be so hostile about my takes being wrong, if anything I should've lended an ear to Melua's perspective.
I know I can be a lot better than this
Yeah...
Could try that yeah
But I certainly don't hold grudges with anyone here
If anything I try not having them at all
Yeah I definitely appreciate Geahcord enough that I don't get too angry over debates
So I mean... I could start reading stuff, that'd be a good start.
Hm... my reading comprehension isn't the greatest, so idk about reading. Reading fanfiction alone takes a lot of time since I tend to drift while reading.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
I wish you the best of luck in your art endeavors. As long as you love creating and the things you create, that's all that matters.
Thank you.
My downfall is worrying too much about what others think instead of being myself.
Hence why I tend to apologize sometimes a while after I say something that's cruel or harsh to someone
My brain just has a worry where if I say something bad I'm like "Oh fuck oh no they probably hate me"
As for my issues, I've been facing immense guilt and regret for the past 6 months. I feel my relationship with staff has worsened due to my arrogance and brooding. And I have this internalized fear I've become well disliked because of it. Why I suddenly felt this now instead of months ago I've no idea, but I wish I could take back everything I've said in these past 6th months because of how much harm I've done.
Probably not sounding the most profound but my point is that when you make something, don't think of how others might react. Think of the satisfaction of getting to share your creation with the world you worked so hard on.
Creating something at the end of the day is something you're satisfied with enough to share with others. And to me, sharing something I worked hard on with others is more satisfying.
Writing and drawing takes a lot of skill, and it's always very nice to share your works of labor with the world. Sometimes it's best not to dwell on reactions to your content, as people probably already like it enough to give you a like on whatever platform you post it to.
When I publish something in <#357682999300718592>, I don't expect any reactions, but I do find it satisfying to be able to share my works with other people. After all, creation in any form is a means to demonstrate your hard work and you should feel proud getting to share it with people already.
I'm unsure how to phrase this properly, but I think you're doing just fine with <#458060276550336522> stuff. As for expecting applause, the struggle of being a creator is finding that balance between peace and making something that you yourself are proud of.
Aww. <#458060276550336522> I've noticed has its ups and downs with people sharing their works and others talking about it
So I didn't wanna leave for too long, though needing a night to reflect on the past few months felt mandatory. Since I really wish I could take a lot of what I said and did back.
Yeah, the community here is nice
So uh... yeah. Last night I departed for the night due to a few personal issues, one being my perceived failure at fitting in. I don't think that's as big an issue anymore, but I've definitely felt hurt knowing that I've done a lot in these past 6 months to hurt various people and friendships with them. That's pretty much why I gave myself a night, but I think from here on I should be good.
Yeeeeeeeeep
That's where earning your right to get that funding comes in. Much like any writer or film director, everyone starts small.

And there's many stories of game development with publishers tampering something just to crank more dough out
Tbf cyberpunk is just an extension of sci-fi though
Psychological horror, sci-fi, and cyberpunk, the holy trinity of 3 things I really like
I'd consider writing a game. I have a lot of ideas for stuff involving sci-fi dystopian stuff, general psychological aspects, etc.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
There's definitely some other hobbies to look into. I've wanted to do YouTube content admittedly, but idk what I'd cover that'd be interesting.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
I do writing, which is one outlet of creation enough. Maybe I could try video editing.
Finally, an outlet to shill Xenosaga /j
Art I can't do cuz of my hands not being the best for it. I've considered maybe YouTube just to upload videos covering stuff I'm interested in
I could try.
Still a decent amount of cash but jfc
So $1k went to $500
It also doesn't help that the social security I get is halved because the government thought we weren't spending all of it when christ almighty we were.
America moment
Yeah...
With the occasional helping out around the house, which I'm having to do more of anyway now that dad's going to also be doing a bit of work.
All I can do is watch anime, play games, write fanfiction, etc.
I don't mean to be a downer about all of this, I more just want people to be aware of my situation, as I find myself not to be in a *bad* place, though I feel I can't do much.
Sorry to say, I can't really do much.
Mom and dad won't let me get a job because if I do, that's a monthly check down the toilet. And with our IRL circumstances overall, they need the extra money.
The former is what I'm fretting over. Due to my IRL circumstances, having social security income and being unable to make money from anywhere else, I can't do anything.
I'm not trying to sound like a dick or anything. I've just had too many thoughts of, "What do I contribute?" Lately.
At this point I'm going to stop worrying about that. I hope. But I'm sorry for all my recent frustrations, as I feel that specifically is what forced me to act a little more harsh. The idea of not being able to do much when you really want to.
Gets to take a load off everyone's back anyway. And knowing that's what my mom is doing and she's getting old, it makes me feel even better to be doing these things for her.
Getting to help clean the house up enough by taking the garbage out, dusting my room off, etc.
So I feel a lot less bad knowing I'm 21 and don't have one yet.
I talked with my older brother about what I was venting about in <#336297387863703552>. I think I'm fine with how things are for now, as he said I shouldn't worry about getting a job just yet. He got his first job just this year at 23.
Damn, did the math on my saves for Xenosaga and I spent 110 hours total across 3 games. That's a small fraction of Liz being in office
Absolutely true
Can't argue with that
Ik Warframe's an absolute grind
I worry about how much money you sank into it. <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>

Of course I play games myself, there's plenty of people who do. Not everyone who plays video games are transphobic or racist asshats. Gamer is also just a goofy sounding word to me, hence why I like using it in a specific manner.
Whenever I use g*mers that's also just me joking
Oh no not at all.
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> Never thought of it that way, would just use it for the memes.
Gamer I use comedically since I see people censor the a out and use it when talking about transphobic asshats sometimes. Or just people that get really salty over literal molehills of issues.
Hm... on the same scale about, but definitely not *close* to that level of creepy
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> Gamers and transphobia?

Even if you're a content creator as big as PewDiePie, you can't say "Hey I'll make a new YouTube and it'll be alright" because your influence on it alone isn't enough to sell the idea of a new platform everyone will jump to
Very good points
There's 800 million videos on YouTube, which is thousands if not millions of GB of data to manage
Yeeeep
Certified Amazon moment
Eventually something is gonna take the torch it once held. YouTube is gonna be bypassed by something eventually, but we're at a point where it's widely accepted as *the* video platform everyone uses
It is a 16-year-old social media platform
Honestly hope that his buyout of Twitter makes its userbase bleed significantly and tries to give it some form of competition. That is bound to happen with any social media platform anyway.
Funny meme man in big brain show
Since Elon wants to make Twitter a platform for "free speech"
Yeah it really wouldn't be a good look. He's probably doing it just to suck on Trump's toes.

There's a lot before you need to consider going toe to toe with YouTube if that makes sense.
Like Melua said yesterday, you'd need hundreds of millions in infrastructure.
We're at the point where we use YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, etc. in spite of the companies behind them being shitty, as there are no real alternatives out there.
It might be years until an alternative comes along that's better than it. That's a flaw with most social media.
Makes me glad I don't have Twitter.
Mario 64 backwards long-jumping itself more than 6 feet underground.
Twitter was already the musty, shit-ridden toilet bowl of the internet. Now it's becoming a KFC-Taco Bell combination bowl
I get a laugh remembering that

To own one of the biggest businesses in the world, only to gut it of its management is stupid.
https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/28/23428132/elon-musk-twitter-acquisition-problems-speech-moderation
Saw an article by The Verge yesterday that went into great detail about how much responsibility weighs on his shoulders, and how Elon making it a "Free speech platform" will *really* fuck with Twitter more than it will help it
It does. Really nuts to someone like me who doesn't like getting *super* politically involved to watch things like this unfold.
UK politics sound incredibly goofy
Had a friend wanting me to drop that one in this channel. Hearing about the Tory stuff I'm mildly amused
Remember kids, don't become a billionaire!
Gee, I sure do wonder why Twitter has had that massive drop. Can't be because of you firing plenty of people and sucking your own dick with all these big promises, no no.
<:kanahana4:580703777011531792>
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1588538640401018880
What I'm getting at is I'm gonna definitely be interested in watching what happens with Twitter next. The platform's not going in a very viable direction, that's for sure.
It's truly a Twitter-eat-Twitter world
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Seeing it sink. Idk if it's comparable to the titanic, but hey at least the lobsters on the ship are gonna be free in the waters again <:kanahana4:580703777011531792>

That too. Twitter is so important to certain groups that if it were to simply shutdown, there'd be a panicked scramble.
Afaik Twitter is what most politicians use, so it'd be a major blow to them I suppose.
~~We have to act shocked when he sells it, y'all~~
I'm with you on Elon selling it. He no doubt just bought it for the clout.
The CGI legs got me laughing way too hard
Ohhh, true.
Between Twitter being messed up by Elon and Meta losing a lot of money, I can't decide on which one is funnier
^ No denying the platform will only continue to sink itself from here
I'd say any. Don't use Twitter myself but I feel bad for artists and general creators who rely on it having to deal with this guy's shit.
<:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
*Carnival Night Zone Act 1.mp3*

Being given the keys to a platform as big as Twitter should've been the first warning sign for them, but yes.
It's even funnier now that people who used to be fanboys are now seeing him for the incompetent narcissist he really is.
Sth like that
So he's "based"
Because he posts memes and is into crypto and all that shit
Did he *not* expect people to turn his "Specify if you're a parody account" thing towards him?

Billions of dollars won't buy Elon out of that.
Hell, yesterday I saw people linking fake Twitter accounts for Valve and Nintendo, the idea of being able to impersonate anyone or anything is really adding fuel to this already overgrown fire.
AI solves everything, huh?
<:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>
Ah wait, since Elon wants to solve his problems with AI, that step itself could be passed over with a fake ID
Heavily agree with that thread btw. If you're going out of your way to include a verification process, why not include an extra step like an ID or something? Sure, those can be easily forged
Pro-Elon people are as insufferable as him.
Watch him announce he's shutting it down or selling it and being like, "I'm a genius, this entire time I was ruining the website just so you people can go touch grass!"
LMAO THAT

Being told you're going to work long hours at high intensity is enough of a turnoff already. How many people are even *left* at Twitter after Elon fired thousands of them?

I've a few friends who really liked his music that stopped listening once he said these things. There's separating the art from artist, then there's, well, situations like these you can't ignore.
Same guy that wants to open a super religious school too. God, the idea a man would want to indoctrinate kids with these terrible beliefs makes me sick.
If you're going to allow an extremely antisemetic shithead like Kanye on Twitter, though? Yeah... time to make Kanye pack his bags too.
Of course I don't like Alex Jones, dude's a fucking loon
Funny how Elon allows Kanye on Twitter again but doesn't allow Alex Jones... now it seems like he might have to pull Kanye from Twitter to do damage control

This article does state that animal deaths in environments like this are common, especially to examine the body in post-mortem, but when you're making it to the triple digits with animal deaths... isn't it time to slow down?

So-called "Free speech platform"
I hate the idea that I, as a content creator (writing) could possibly have my one source of creativity taken away from me because someone types a few short words into a prompt
> Look, if we lived in a world in which universal basic incomes were common, medicine and food were free, and we had safety nets in place to make sure everyone can live a happy and healthy life, I‚Äôd be more okay with AI art and similar tools potentially replacing traditional careers and jobs. But that‚Äôs not the case. Until it is, more automation will lead to more people struggling to survive. The forward march of technology may be hard to stop but that doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs universally correct, ethically sound, or something we should just let happen. Even if you truly believe ‚ÄúAI-created art‚Äù is good, that still doesn‚Äôt mean we have to accept the immense toll it will take on actual living humans as our future.
Love or hate Kotaku, they're spitting fax rn
That really *does* suck

As ludicrous as it sounds, I would not be surprised if I woke up tomorrow and saw "Twitter closes its doors" as a headline
Elon's mental breakdown arc
He's gonna do what he did with his other decisions and keep asking "Are you sure?" I can see it now
~~Yoo it's that language used in Duel of the Fates~~
Also who wrote the Twitter support message? Was it the broom in the Janitor's former office?
He's probably going to ban other car manufacturers so he can promote Tesla upfront
Donning the clown wig and nose, he rides his unicycle onto every land mine he could possibly step on
He's really eager to drive everyone away, every move he makes the floor breaks beneath him.
Apparently it is, to my surprise

<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> Did I do something bad
Don't ya love it when your only way of communicating with the few people who are left gets taken away and Twitter is really on the fritz already?
https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/24/23613288/twitter-slack-jira-outages-performance-degradation
Well, this news was also from yesterday
Hell yeah
R. Kelly yesterday, Weinstein today

https://www.nytimes.com/2023/02/23/arts/music/r-kelly-sentenced-federal-child-sex-crimes.html
Also that new Studio 3Hz anime that was announced awhile back.
Currently I'm trying to ignore anything coming out as of late to get my PTW slimmed down. The only exception being the Wonder Egg OVA
But I hear it's pretty good.
I need to watch Vivy soonish
This final special is really going to make or break the series, but I'm optimistic things will go well.
||Going from trying to save the people that meant the most to them to battling some android and it's multiple machines was definitely not how I expected the final act to go.||
^
I love myself some sci-fi
Imo
Episode 7 was great though
That's what a lot of people agreed on, myself included.
Where some view it as good, others are generally divided.
I noticed a lot of people on the Wonder Egg server I mod are generally divisive on the closing episodes.
Oh yeah, can agree.
Episode 12 was cool because of the ||Parallel Ai|| plotline, but that aside I'm really curious as to how things will recover.
Wonder Egg's closing few episodes you could really tell were rushed. Episode 10, for as good as it was, introduced us to this mysterious new antagonist. Then we got the backstory in episode 11, which imo felt like they dumped the villain on us way too late.
Same.
https://twitter.com/yuyucow/status/1376945769387810817?s=12
Wonder Egg was really good imo, in spite of it's production issues. I hate how Aniplex/Funimation tried covering it up like nothing happened.
Yeah.
From what I read, due to a recap episode taking one of the 12 episode slots, we were going to be compensated with one that fully closes the book a couple months later.

New Wonder Egg special due to be an hour long

<:SerenaSmile:672908572774105109>
Oh shit
Molcar... movie?!
||The way all the bullets paused and absolutely shredded the environment around them is my favorite scene. It's just an insanely fun watch from start to finish.||
||This fight imo is one of the best aspects of the movie.||
(Madoka Rebellion) || https://youtube.com/watch?v=tVi_fs2oz3E ||
Mangadex is back up <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
https://mangadex.org/
It's best to go in with a fresh mind into Uma Musume.
^
I'd say something about season 2, but I think that'd spoil a bit since it's a different character on the same team as Special Week
But Special Week/Suzuka is pretty upfront yuri wise
There isn't necessarily kisses per se
Season 2 is autobiographical to an extent iirc
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Season 1 is good, just bogged down with typical tropes you see in most yuri anime.
Honestly feel it's far better than season 1 before it, though that manages to stand on it's own somewhat.
But I highly recommend Uma Musume S2
Utena is 39 episodes, and I have plenty of 12/13 episode shows to go before it.
I'm gonna be starting that one really soon.
Season 2 is so good.
^
I hear Super Cub is fantastic.
Haven't watched FMA Brotherhood
They've gotten the character designer from Flip Flappers and Princess Principal on it with the director of FMA Brotherhood.
I like 3Hz for Flip Flappers and Princess Principal, so I'm generally excited to see that they're still going.
Yes.
Not sure if that will come out this year though
That's pretty good
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
I hear great things about Vivy.
That shot is absolutely beautiful.
I love the XV poster.
Nice!
She's been wanting me to watch it for ages.
A friend of mine (she calls herself Nui) is a huuuuuuuuge fan of it down to that character being her nickname and recently trying to cosplay as Ryuuko.
I am personally excited for KLK
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
39 episodes, though. That's pretty daunting.
I heard the OP and immediately fell in love. It's visually pretty darn stunning combined with the OP being really catchy.
KLK I hear is amazing, same with Utena.
In terms of "long" anime I have on my PTW, Kill La Kill and Utena are certainly ones I'm looking forward to.
I cannot wait to jump into that.
A new character was going to be introduced and all, but because it was a 12 episode cour, they couldn't do anymore.
Yeah. Hell, I hear that the only reason the anime ended the way it did was due to the manga not slowing down at that point.
So I'll be pretty all over in terms of watching things for awhile.
+ reading the manga to it
I'm watching Girls Last Tour next week (as I like to space out when I start/finish an anime)
Watching Houseki no Kuni was an absolute blast, but I'm not sure when I'll tackle the manga.
<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
My favorite episode is either episode 13 or 6.
The ending to this one actually got me sad for awhile. It really makes you think.
I watched some pretty good anime this year, but Lain is one I had to watch twice because it was really good
Yeah
I knew the moment I went into it that it'd easily be in my top all time anime, and left genuinely amazed.
Same.
It's definitely worth a watch if you want to find something worth analyzing. I've been getting my money's worth recalling certain things and thinking about how certain moments specifically stand out.
Aside from the story taking a rewatch to piece together, I really enjoyed the visual style and general themes. It's a philosophical deconstruction of tech at it's core and it excels really well at that.
Ngl really want to say Lain is one of my favorite anime I've watched this year.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp5kUmni5Dk
Brand new world is my favorite
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2UMMlEjPeEU
De De Mouse killed it with the soundtrack, though
The direction the story takes is really wild.
Wonder Egg honestly felt a bit too ridiculous towards the end. Where I enjoyed the characters and their arcs, Momoe and Rika being my personal favorites
And people agree that the final episodes are really rushed for what they are, and their plotlines don't necessarily reflect what we saw in the beginning at all.
Being a mod on the Wonder Egg server - hell, even being there from the beginning - I've noticed people discuss when the show began to crack.
Can't say I left disappointed, but I did feel Wonder Egg is a really tough sell towards the end.
Was even my first time watching anime seasonally
It is definitely the most ambitious anime I've watched
With all the last minute additions, WEP wraps up on a very jarring note.
And I imagine that in terms of writing, they had ideas for a longer cour. I personally think Wonder Egg needed more than 12 episodes.
Tbh Cloverworks were pretty understaffed project wise I read
Yeahhh
They forced a recap on the team pretty much, the episode with ||Frill|| was meant to be episode 10 iirc
I blame the fact Aniplex really screwed with the production.
Tbh
It's 45 minutes iirc
Yep
This looks so good.
https://youtu.be/hnQOO8Y1Ck0
||Episode 10 threw everyone for a loop.||
Wonder Egg starts to show it's cracks towards the end of it's run imo
Yeahhhh
"What's our budget?"
"$5 and Powerpoint."
"What about sound effects?"
"Do you have Gary's Mod?"
I saw this on another server and someone said, "If you close your eyes you can visualize a GMod shitpost from 2011"
LOL
That looked awkward af
But wow
We talked about it up a bit ago
Man, reading this sucks fr.
"After xx years, lost Crunchyroll anime High Guardian Spice's episodes are now released."
Hey, that'd be a rather interesting lost media article though.
You make it, and then the publisher is like, "Oh wait you can't release it. Not until we say so."
Imagine being told "Hey, you can make an anime."
If the people who wrote Modern Sonic since 2010 only had a Wikipedia page to go off of what the series was without any prior knowledge, anything is possible.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEsNDDwhSJ4
Might save Girls Last Tour for later, since I just remembered another anime I really wanted to watch.
||Yuuki Yuuna tackles disability so well imo. Later in an episode on the beach, I love how they give Tougou a little device so she can float on water. That was adorable.||
YES
^
This episode is GOAT
FliFla and Madoka I can recommend too.
Especially since both have punchy protagonists.
I'd suggest Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero, because if you loved Symphogear, you'll love YuYuYu
Hm...
But it's still ya know, getting things for it.
I hear that LL isn't as massively popular like it once was
Uma Musume is horse girls
Everyone's hopping on Uma Musume bandwagon
I hear LL is pretty much dying off at this point.
I've been in Magical Girl suffering hell since I first watched Symphogear
The only idol hell I've fallen into is horse idol
Plenty of regular users
Uhhh
Josh, Prim
A lot of people on WEPcord are mad LL fans
Yeahhh I've heard all about Nozomi being weird in S1
And only took a deeper dive into that circle with Yuuki Yuuna and then eventually Madoka.

This video is according to the writer a roughly correct decryption of the anime.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoUmj4D5fjc
This director was hospitalized twice when the show was airing.
WEP has had one of the rockiest anime productions I've ever read into.

An animator for WEP that's on WEPcord had this to share.
The best thing about Lain is that everyone walks away from it with a different interpretation.
Though it is interesting knowing that the writer himself says it's roughly correct.
Same.
And just now is it getting really, really ridiculous.
I remember wanting to watch spider isekai at first, if not for the fact it's Aoi Yuuki as the MC, but then I heard people talk left and right about how shit it is.
Courage is my favorite CN show
BRO WHAT
That's a lot of CGDCT
Holy damn
Got a relatively moderate PTW
If anyone wants to view how many anime I've watched lol
https://anilist.co/user/DasAntihero/



Once I watch KLK, Sangatsu, and watch Hibike + Liz, I will tell you when I start Shirobako.
Hibike is gonna be really interesting too, but I'm going to especially prioritize KLK and Sangatsu.
KLK and Sangatsu are definitely what I'm looking forward to of the "Longer than a single cour" count of episodes.
Cannot wait for getting to tear through this list.
Sangatsu definitely is gonna be up there as one of the first things I'll watch once I clear the "12 or 13 episodes" thing out. But I'm watching KLK first since a person on SKRScord has been wanting me to watch that so much.
Small world.
I remember you were on SKRScord actually
A friend named Eileen really wants me watch this.
My watch priority atm is:

Paranoia Agent -> Gridman -> Bocchi -> Eizouken -> Zoku and Zan Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei -> Tanya (maybe?)
Thinking about doing all the 12/13 episode things (at least, those without a season/spinoff like Hibike)

Gonna be starting a watch through my PTW soon since I haven't been on this lately
It's still pretty sad that the adaptation has to suck like this, since the idea seems kind of cool.
Ah.
But I hear the manga at least is far better.
I avoided Spider isekai after hearing that it was only really carried by Aoi Yuuki
WEP has had one of the rockiest anime productions I have ever read up on.
Me neither.
These are rumors, so take it with a grain of salt ofc.
Taken from WEPcord
I keep getting the "non binary gems" thing mixed up
Wait, it's "they"
They're all based off rocks and, dependent on their hardness on the Moh's rock scale, break easily or can tank certain things.
It follows a gem named Phosphorous (she has a longer name)
Land of the Lustrous
If they couldn't handle this, they probably wouldn't be able to handle the toxicity of Nintendo fans whining when a certain game they all want doesn't appear on Direct.
Imagine what'd happen if there was a JP exclusive Direct
||That moment was really hype||
My favorite moment in any episode was probably ||Phos getting her gold arms||
But you're sure as hell going to
Not gonna say who it is
Also you *might* recognize Jade's voice.
(Land of the Lustrous) ||I heard episode 12 would've been the timeframe they introduced a new character, but because it was only 12 episodes, they chose to go with an ending reflective of the first episode.||
Kinda sad that it didn't at least get 2 cours
I want to read the manga soon ig
It's cool af.
Look, all I want to say is just watch it.
^
Ntm they're goddesses already
And it makes me question wtf they were doing when they had 3 months to work on this.
There's a few animators on the Wonder Egg server and they've said that they just went into second KA
COURSE
fucking
Of
https://twitter.com/Beabosaur/status/1409238391116505093?s=20
But episode 8 is where it's at. Without a doubt the best Rice Shower episode.
The best episode of the series since episode 7 is really good
Volume 3 has like
Holy shit
Haven't watched FB yet, but given that it bypassed FMA Brotherhood by a single point, that says this finale's damn good.
Holy shit
So uhhhhh
But Funi subs are the day after
WEP Special Edition airs tomorrow
English subs are expected tomorrow, the 30th
Only in French.
It hasn't been subtitled yet
BUT
It dropped today
Yeah, it's just episode 13
For WEP
Episode 13
Episode 8
The mecha episode?
Ntm the fact that there was even an insert song parodying mecha insert songs
I liked the aesthetic
The mecha episode was a ton of fun, yeah.
Like that entire episode that's a horror parody of Class S.
Flip Flappers is moreso a nod to *several* genres than it is one.
Well, they're both magical girl in a way
Yeah.
Didn't keep that distinction throughout, but it was def similar in the fact both had troubled productions.
WEP reminded me of Flip Flappers from just the first episode
Yeah.
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
With how the Special Edition recaps for the first half hour, you'll be just fine.
Dw
Cloverworks said it was pretty much an unexpected bump in the road.
It threw a lot of people off.
Episode 7 was imo the best the series had, but I loved episode 10.
Almost a 7.
Still an 8/10 on my end, though a very *very* light.
Yeah, that's what happened with me.
Had it's flubs towards the end writing wise, but it's a shame how much of a mess the production has been.
A good series that was bogged down by it having an incredibly terrible production cycle.
WEP is probably one of the biggest anime tragedies imo
^
There was a lot of potential in WEP for it to be a solid enough 2 cour.
And I agree
I saw a reviewer state it really needed to be a 2-cour show
10 was Momoe with Kaoru, the egg boy
7 is when Rika wants to find out who her real father is
Yes
Episode 10 was great
Episode 7 was imo the highest mark of quality
^
Guess that's the price it pays for being overambitious.
Tbh I felt it's quality began to slightly crack as it neared the last handful of episodes.
I didn't find WEP overrated at all.
(Wonder Egg Priority: My Priority thoughts)
I finished the special
Alright
Where I enjoyed it, I feel it could've been handled so much better.
Man, I'm going to look back on WEP with such a mixed feeling.
Or, half a recap episode.
It makes me wonder what was going on for the past 3 months if we ended up with a recap episode.
I am honestly so pissed with that rn
Never have I seen an anime so ambitious fall so flat on it's face, down a flight of stairs, super long jump glitching into Bowser's last level, then die immediately on the first set of platforms
The production of WEP can be summed up as one thing:

A mess.
^
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
This was an actual piece of animation in the episode
And yes

"That was it? That was the Wonder Egg Priority special? That was just a bunch of inconclusive bullshit!"
I said in my review that The Matrix Revolutions was far more satisfying than WEP Special
But after that? They ain't getting me with that shit again.
And only a few of Special Edition that I'm gonna put into my anime screenshots folder
I have screenshots of all 12 episodes of WEP
Satoshi Kon only had like one TV anime
Things felt well paced imo for the first couple of episodes.
This.
The writer of WEP to the audience watching the special:
Just a very ridiculous last minute ass shove
A good character
Frill was the most ridiculous plot point.
It got way too convoluted, Frill felt like she was introduced way too late
Though Ai's friends seemed far more interesting than Ai herself imo
I liked it's pacing for each new episode being a character story.
Yeah.
Even though episode 10 was absolutely good if you liked Momoe
But episode 7 was imo the peak of the series
I'd say watch the other episodes if you feel like wanting to
Yes.
WEP was genuinely promising in it's first 7 episodes.

Are all simultaneously pissed off.
The WEP server I moderate, my friend Eileen, and generally everyone I've spoken to since I've watched
**Yes**
One of the few strong writing points is the fact that it does tackle LGBT representation very well
I did really like the trans representation in WEP
The entire last half of the series is saddening.
And where I enjoyed it
I jumped into it as like my first seasonal
I recommend just staying away from WEP at this point
Yeah
Hoo boy, it's been a blast.
Talking with people on WEPcord atm since they had this thing called "WEPcast" to discuss the episodes as they aired.
I'm gonna be very, very excited once I get to it
"Oh, you love Devil May Cry and you love the action of Symphogear, you'll love this."
As in, they were really trying to get me to watch it when I was rewatching Symphogear
A friend of mine loves KLK
Yet the only reason I know of it's existence is because of 02
DITF is something I heard a tiny bit about
We saw Ai and Rika do it in episode 3, and some of us who did remember it were expecting them to at least have a sleepover where they try fighting Wonder Killers as a whole squad.
Whatever happened with that?
Was the "Dream syncing" thing
Honestly one writing thing that everyone remembered that got abandoned
^
Cloverworks do be Cloverworks at the end of the day
Yep.
Would have loved to know a little more about Airu before that episode, but nah. We even said, "Say what you will about Frill, but she at least felt foreshadowed given the Acca house was in the background."
Honestly don't blame 'em. I would have loved an explanation on the Egg world, but we never got it.
Everyone was beginning to slowly form a mixed - negative opinion of it post-episode 7
Yeah. Hell, they had pretty much began disliking the series at a certain point.
I've yet to watch Tanya
Madoka, Hibki, uhhhm...
I knew she sounded a bit familiar
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Borr and the others are interesting, but I'd need to continue watching.
I think my favorite side character right now is Samurai Calibur.
But I hear it's really good.
I'm gonna watch Dynazenon later when I slim my PTW enough
Ahhh.
It's a fun series so far. 4 episodes in atm, but it's made a fine impression.
I'm definitely excited to finish it.
My issue with her specifically is that where I'm enjoying the series, her character is blatantly written as unlikable. Though the Kaiju designs she makes and sends out are cool af.
So far I'm liking it, though Akane is pretty unlikable.
Started watching Gridman yesterday.
Yep
I need to watch it personally
Seeing Science Saru, looking them up, and realizing they made Eizouken definitely is mindblowing


A friend of mine who loves Trigger showed they have drawn Star Wars before
This looks amazing.
Alright, I'm in.
Is this basically Animatrix but Star Wars?
üëÄ
Calibur looks so done.
Eizouken I've only seen the OP for. I like the general aesthetic, and hear that it's a great way of nodding towards how grueling the anime industry is.
Thinking Bocchi and Eizouken. Really excited for the latter, but the only other production I've seen from Science Saru was Night is Short. Should maybe watch Ping Pong the Animation when I get the chance.
So I decided what "Slice of Life" shows to knock off my AniList post watching Gridman and Paranoia Agent.
Also if you've read into the IRL horse history, you might get a lot more mileage out of the show
Hope you're having fun.
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
A friend group of mine are huge Revue Starlight fans and decided to watch it - one was reading it- and said that it's a surprisingly solid adaptation.
I hear Kageki Shojou has a surprisingly good first episode.
It had me hyping up an episode where the girls have a sleepover and fight Wonder Killers.
We only see it in one episode.
But the issue?
We're introduced to a novel idea in dream syncing, which was a very cool idea.
I said this on another server that I find WEP to have this issue where it belts off gimmicks.
Same.
Hell, people's thoughts of "Good script, poor execution" for J-Dramas carried over into Wonder Egg. As reception of one of his J-Dramas was just that.
There was a TV drama he wrote in 2014 about a children's home, which was met with negative reception and lead to sponsors pulling out for his means of handling it.
Where the infamy comes from, however, is that he often writes about themes such as ||suicide|| and LGBT, but it's done in a way where people are left questioning it. Especially since he seems to solely dabble in writing about subjects that are considered controversial.
He's a writer for J-Dramas, with WEP being his first ever written anime.
I did mention in my google doc as I've written the review that Shinji Nojima, the writer, is very well known for his means of including and writing about touchy subject matters in a way that it has drawn plenty of criticism.
||Yeah, that absolutely pissed me off.||
It's not every day you hear about an anime tackling LGBT themes very well.
Which is a shame, since I loved the trans rep character Kaoru, I really liked the way the series initially tackled ||self harm and suicide||, and in all found the way Wonder Egg's means of going about working to approach these subjects to be really good.
Continued from <#458060276550336522>:

An issue I have with WEP is that where I do appreciate the way it's subject matters were tackled in the beginning, during later episodes a glaring issue I noticed is that it's means of tackling said matters were written more for the shock value factor if anything.
If a Zebra girl existed, their kick would fucking launch him
Zebra girls
Or holy hell
God forbid he try feeling up a goat girl if those ever exist
His first big mistake is feeling the legs of a horse
Nothing like that happens in S2 at all
I always find it hilarious when he gets kicked around though
I like how, when I went from S1 to S2, I noticed immediately how much of a bro Trainer was
^
Just looking at it in retrospect, you can tell they were really hyping up the mobile game by having the character personalities far more upfront. And to me, it's fine. Especially since each character is fun.
Oh yeah I liked it.
Suppose it was all meant to be typical since the mobile game was going to release in 2018
But a lot of the yuri stuff and general writing felt very... typical.
To me I liked S1
Just wait until after you watch
Ahhh right
Once you read through and realize the connections certain characters have, a lot of things start to click
Highly encourage reading this site:
https://www.jbis.jp/
So it's cute seeing Teio being Symboli's son IRL being translated into "Clingy student"
Rudolf is the Sire of Teio
Also the reason Teio is super clingy around Rudolf?
Special Week and Silence Suzuka are actually half-brothers IRL
When I watch a bunch of absolute bangers like Yuuki Yuuna, FliFla, etc.
I can genuinely say that I'm not the biggest fan of it like I once was
But when I look at how I watched it in 2019 and compare it to what I watched in 2020
I remember being a fan of Konosuba at first
Yeah
Princess Principal, Flip Flappers, Revue Starlight, I guess I can say Symphogear but that was after Flip Flappers
Mainly because everything that came after was great.
But in retrospect, I'm not as big a fan of Konosuba as I once was.
2019 was when I watched Konosuba, which was my sort of "Hop back into anime" show
Flip Flappers was and still is my favorite anime of all time
Before Symphogear, I remember February 2020 had me watching Princess Principal and Flip Flappers
Isekai Quartet is more so just an ad for "Hey, did you know your favorite Light Novel has 12 minute crossover shorts with other Light Novels?"
Forget giving Konosuba the season 3 it's fans have long wanted.
I'm actually fairly baffled.
Yeah
Despite the author saying 'This is not how you're supposed to see him"
Looked up to as a role model in the fandom
Someway
I like the fact that Kazuma is somehow
^
And couldn't find any
Immediately searched for Darkness cosplaying as Kirika art
I remember when I read up Ai Kayano voiced Kirika
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Ai Kayano or Cristina Vee
In sub and dub she has some good VAs too
Darkness is good
Truuue
~~Then again I think Megumin is overrated~~
Not that spicy
So I mean
When I first watched it
I heard people shitting on Konosuba as far back as 2019
Tbh
It just speedruns the manga
I hear Horimiya is good
"Haha explosions, gender equality, Kazuma is my role model!!"
Overall the fandom is what turned me off from it
Doesn't get any better when you take the fandom into the account.
Konosuba did initially start off as me liking it, but given how much I've watched since, I don't think I'd want to go back
Yeah.
A great friend of mine who loves Revue does love it though
No, but I hear it's good
(Gridman episode 9) ||Uhhh whhaaa?||
Just CR being CR
The OP is a banger
Am pretty amazed with it's idea
I heard that one come up talking about isekai on another server and tbh
I hear Grimgar is kinda good
Was pleasantly surprised when I looked up Kazuma's VA and saw he was in Flip Flappers, Sora Yori, etc.
He's pretty funny
I really love Kazuma's VA
Yeah, I do admire the VA work
My point exactly.
^
Unsure if I'd watch the movie anytime soon.
Konosuba's biggest flaw is that it's humor runs dry quick. Once you hear one joke, the series runs with it. Haha Kazuma's a pervert, haha Megumin likes to blow things up, haha Darkness likes to get hurt. It's core issues are that where it does subvert tropes normally found in isekai, in execution, it's a flawed take on it. The isekai genre as a whole has become so oversaturated since Konosuba that a lot of the jokes don't seem to stick the landing they once had imo.
I can easily say it's a pretty meh anime overall.
But in utilizing it via the lens of someone who's watched about 30-something series in the past year (if we count OVAs and films)
In retrospect, I can appreciate it as "The anime that got me back into anime"
Decided with how we briefly discussed Konosuba yesterday to dunk the seasons I both had at an 8 to a 7 and 6 respectively.
I know of a few people who are really looking forward to it
Ooh. You probably won't have any trouble with Lain, considering it's as much a mindfuck and lasts only 13 episodes
Lain can be a pretty big mindscrew
It's definitely great if you can vibe with it, but it can be pretty slow paced.
Lain is pretty good, just an anime I'd say is not for everyone
I'd say exercise caution
Geah ended September 28th, 2019
Lain coincidentally also ended September 28th, 1998
Speaking of anime that released in July

Idk, the whole "We're gonna make an alliance" thing seemed boring to me
The halfway point
I remember watching S1 and then losing interest at like
That "Forest" looking like some pre-rendered Sega Dreamcast ass background
And seeing an image of it
I remember hearing the CGI was abysmal
(Gridman) ||Ohhhh shit||
I will be watching Dynazenon soon.
Paranoia Agent is up next in the "Summer of desperately trying to clear my PTW"
Aaaand, it gets my seal of approval.
That was very good.
||And another character to add to the "Has punched God" list.||
||Akane as a kaiju, though. This is pretty hype.||
(Gridman) ||HYPE||
||Akane stabbing Yuta, and the OP changing to have the bloodied blade in her hand was a slight, yet cool detail.||
I had to stop at around the time I started this episode to eat, but it is definitely pretty intense.
Will be finishing tonight
Episode 3 and 4 are my favorites, since episode 4 has a great ending segment, and episode 3 is pretty interesting since it displays a character with a personality disorder and their general struggle with it.
4 episodes into Paranoia Agent, and I can say it's pretty good.
Kid's got that Steve from Blue's Clues shirt
Just started Paranoia Agent.
Just making up your own conclusion seems to be a lot of people's thoughts on the special at this point.
I think those who want to watch the special shouldn't. No real conclusion to anything at all, and the only thing that does get an ending is very insulting to say the least.
^
I've seen far more people on the WEP server I mod begin to rewrite the anime overall than "I'm gonna finish the series"
^
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Who was asking for a sequel
When asked about a sequel to Wonder Egg, director Shin Wakabayashi said, "I'm exhausted. Ask me again in 6 months."
https://twitter.com/ninaryo/status/1413509378695593987
That's all kinds of crazy
But yeah
I just posted that in <#336297840529899522>
20 anime, 2 are yet to air
My PTW is pretty heavy atm
Each episode tells us about the drama of the character in it's sights, and does it rather efficiently up to their encounter with Shounen Bat.
A very atmospheric, melancholy "character of the week" story that is really great. If you liked Wonder Egg for it's structure of each episode focusing on a new character, Paranoia Agent will fill that gap far more efficiently.
Where I wouldn't say it's a 10/10 masterpiece, I will say it is definitely a must watch.
I'm 5 episodes away from wrapping up Paranoia Agent.
Considering what happened with Kentaro Miura, I would not really take a chance with continuing my story/adaptation if my health is looking that bad.
^
Yuuki Yuuna S3 had the same thing happen to it and it's releasing this October
All they did was outright announce it was being made and that was it.
I imagine news for it will come eventually
You can't just say "New Studio 3Hz" anime and leave me in the dark, anime industry <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
Still wondering when we're getting this
https://anilist.co/anime/133412/Healer-Girl/
That entire episode was pretty dark. Nana Mizuki really does enjoy playing characters who suffer.
Huh, I knew Taeko sounded familiar
The whole "Episode title on an object/background" thing is one of many details I admire in this anime.
After that, I've got Zetsubou Sensei's second and third seasons. Then I'll either watch Tanya, or begin my dive into Hibike Euphonium with Liz then watch the other two seasons
Bocchi and Eizouken perhaps
So now that Paranoia Agent was a home run, idk what's next
"The Virginity of the World's Greatest Gamer" sounds like the final boss lmao
LOL
Seems like something you could throw into an AI generator and it'd pop out with millions
Isekai titles always fascinate me

~~Perfect Chaos?!~~
Given I have 19 things on my backlog, and a want to hopefully finish everything before the two anime on it air, I am working really hard to finish things in an orderly fashion.
And I hear it's kind of a timesink since the watch order is a little complicated
I would watch that myself, but I have so many things on my backlog
But this is on my laptop, where I have a 1TB HDD inside
I have a 3TB HDD on my main rig
Wow!
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I heard the entire Monogatari series is huuuge if you save the whole thing
Oh wow!
348 folders?!
Holy smokes
I had Flip Flappers, Uma Musume, Lain, and Screenshots there already
Transferred all the anime that was on my HDD to my phone
That sure does say something
Oooh yikes. I just looked up Perfect Blue's TVTropes page, and if your film here in America had to be *edited* to keep an R rating
Millennium Actress looks great
I hear Paprika is really good as well
I hear he's got plenty of really good films, but idk which one I'd want to go looking at
So after Paranoia Agent, specifically after I clear my PTW, what Satoshi Kon work do you think I should give a watch?
Can you really license a single anime with $100k?
SubsPlease is just the Funi uploads afaik
Would def want to check that out though
I've heard of the former, but not the latter.
I still have yet to watch the other 2 seasons of Zetsubou though
Especially since I enjoyed Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei and Madoka
So I guess one of these days, I should check that series out.
One of the servers I'm in has a huge set of people who love it
I hear about that one a lot
If Wonder Egg stayed on a better track, it could've been my favorite.
Uma Musume S2 is an easy contender, but Lain and Paranoia Agent are up my alley.
Not sure what I'd say my favorite anime of the ones I've watched this year are
Yes.
Since she's really adamant on wanting me to see Liz first.
Well, idk. I'll have to consult her about it.
But loved Liz
They technically weren't huge about Hibike for some reason
They have their reasons for wanting me to watch it first
Idk
Hm...
Huh?
But I just remember very little.
I love the characters, the world, and the action.
But a lot of details really escape me at this point.
Saw it last year and remember it was really good.
I should rewatch it personally.
Oh yeah, for those who haven't seen it yet
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snwc9SnOrbY
They've been wanting me to watch it since they saw I was into Symphogear and Devil May Cry.
Since a friend of mine, when I said I was going to be looking at 20 episode anime after 12/13 episode anime wants me to watch KLK.
Shirobako is probably going to be looked at after I watch KLK or something
And watching Shirobako isn't gonna be for a long time, since I plan on trying to tackle larger anime after my 12/13 episode anime are all done.
A friend recommended me to watch Liz before Hibike
I'll save Hibike Euphonium for last on my list, since I'm adding in watching Liz & The Blue Bird before Hibike S1 and S2
Bocchi will follow shortly after
Sooo I have decided the next anime to knock off my list is Eizouken
Hope you enjoy the ride
Nice!
Would watch this personally, but my anime tastes are so attuned to certain genres that I'm unsure if I could visit it
Gives me flashbacks to waking up and realizing I was up too early seeing this play on Cartoon Network
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KwCfHVGamn8
Houseki no Kuni fans:
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Houseki no Kuni S2 when, Orange?
I saw HnK and thought "Houseki no Kuni" and thought, "Season 2 was out already?"
But I have noticed this quite a lot.
I don't know her as long as Ardania has
Can say this too
^
I can't process this shit rn
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Like wtf
My brain feels like it's being hit rapidly
Truly makes sense to me I guess.

Since Eileen just came online
I'm getting my answer on Liz before Hibike rn
IRC? Daaaaamn
But I want to watch Hibike overall
I would watch Liz first just because my friend really wants me to
This situation is confusing me.
Hm... Idk.


Got a good reasoning
Alright
Eileen would probably give me more of an answer than an ass pull.
Yeah... I'm gonna wait for the actual friend to get online to get their reasoning
^
Not my actual friend, but here's another's reasoning
An iconic song from the HnK play
(You Are) Already Dead
Calibur was very cool
But I liked Yuta and Rikka
Akane once things came full circle
Episode 11 began really cool
I liked episodes 2, 6, 11, and 12
Episode 12 was very hype
Ooh!
Any episode you like in particular?
Glad you enjoyed it!
But Calibur is undeniably the best side character imo
Borr is great
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i50igBzmCdc
Also the soundtracks absolutely slap
Honestly half the reason I stuck around (despite really liking it) was Lain
^
Also the general aesthetic of places.
I personally really enjoyed the scenes involving the Men in Black
Lain has some really cool moments watching for the first time, though.
Even going in with the mindset of "I'll try to decipher it as I go"
Personally, I really liked Lain
^
Haven't watched Dynazenon yet, but I remember Rikka thighs being a thing
Also yeah, I've seen art on Mujina. *Really* interesting to say the least
Strange, never thought to watch that one
Ahhh
I only saw this part
Oh shit
Wonder what the shipping pair for Dynazenon is
Here's the video talking about the series in-depth
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoUmj4D5fjc
But that's the charm to it
I will say that Lain is a really confusing series to understand
Explains the series far better than most, and is considered a roughly correct interpretation by Chiaki J. Konaka, the writer.
There is a great video essay out there called 'Explaining Iwakura Lain" you should definitely watch once you finish
Lain herself is the God of the Wired. Her father was fake and she's seeing a mere projection before making her presence in the world she rest to include without her.
Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hp5kUmni5Dk
Yeah.
The last episode had the OP play after Lain's "I'm confused again" monologue
And where they went the entire run without the ED
I remember seeing someone upload the anime series to YouTube without the OP/ED
It is an interesting relic that also does summarize each episode
Where it doesn't do any "analysis" articles and hasn't been updated in a long while
I found this website awhile ago
https://lain.wiki/wiki/Main_Page
Pulled a Madoka and saved episode 3 for the dark shit I read.
I heard slightly about it. It's very fucked up
I have a thought process where I want to try piecing things together as I watch/read/play through them, then look into other discussions on what I've digested
Sometimes it's worth it to watch things and sorta go through them analytically
Then I start deeply analyzing it post-watch
Like with Paranoia Agent
I like to think briefly about what each episode was about as I move from one to the next
Lain has a lot of interesting analysis stuff at least. I like how you can walk away from the series as a whole after finishing with a different interpretation.
Even the ED is just a slow camera pan
I imagine it's only slow to compensate for the fact they want you to digest it.
Wouldn't blame you.
I've seen most people I know either watch it through and enjoy it, or drop it because of the pacing issues.
And just the fact that it is very confusing.
I think one thing that turns most people off from Lain is its pacing
^
And considering nothing happens with dream syncing, nothing important happens with the pets outside of killing them, etc. I can say Wonder Egg had a thing for gimmicks.
I think my biggest issue with WEP writing wise, however, is his way of cramming in the sci-fi themes. It felt like a lot of things weren't really foreshadowing this direction. It's severely flawed in going from this mostly grounded, yet relatable suburban fantasy to a jumbled sci-fi mess with AI children and parallel worlds
(This thread covers his history prior to Wonder Egg of writing things with touchy themes) || https://twitter.com/AnimesocMegan/status/1351043079319539724 ||
This writer has a history of writing J-Dramas, with this being his first anime he's written. And he was already getting flack in the community around those for his way of handling sensitive themes.
WEP I was going to praise for its ways of handling topics like LGBT, ||suicide||, etc. at first. Then I looked into the history of the writer and realized that it wasn't really coming from a place of wanting to spread awareness or discuss them meaningfully. No. Instead, it was just to add in touchy topics.
^
All I understood, even with a user summarizing it on the WEP server I've been on since the start and mod is that Neiru has been an AI all along, and everyone drifted apart with the person they fought so hard for changing.
People say Flip Flappers had a very rushed ending, but I'd gladly take rushed over a horribly executed setup that shits itself into the void.
Overall, Wonder Egg just feels disappointing to me. A very ambitious anime original that had plenty of fair ideas, but started to crack as the writer began to pull the rug from under you.
To me, it feels like an ending trying to setup a season 2, but it knows it won't get one.
I'm still trying to figure that out myself.
2 minutes into Eizouken so far. I'm liking it already.
I'm 2 episodes in and I love this series a lot.
Yeah ik
Sounds just like the actual industry!
Huh.
What's this supposed to say?
I love this goofball.
A college student who is unnamed is given the chance to spend the 2 years of his life he wasted all over again doing different career paths. But they're all pretty similar with familiar faces in each one.
You should watch it. A very, very good show.
It looks like Tatami Galaxy without the director behind it.
Only anime I plan on watching this Fall is Yuuki Yuuna season 3.
I'm just going through my backlog this whole Summer.
I'm going to wait on movie 2, then rewatch the anime
It's always been said ambition is a double edged sword.
Same.
Then it started to show he had nowhere to go with them.
Since he was just doing what he did best, writing down to earth and relatable characters.
He certainly exceled early on, I feel.
Ahhh.
I don't watch Gundam, but I mean... Idk. I found it really funny.
This is what they had to say
A person on another server is going off that this is canonically one of the worst pilots.
But holy fuck
Haven't even watched a single Gundam series
https://youtu.be/GcFg3xOsR_M
And I saw one upload at 42GB
I looked up FLCL out of curiosity because I know that one's 6 episodes
It's amazing how much attention to detail Uma has.
This scene will never not be funny
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vo4M5h_6bOk
Mainly so I can remember things better.
For me, whenever I watch anime, I take screenshots during it
And with Eizouken I've only watched 3 episodes so far of the 12.
I've been trying to go about my backlog, starting with 12/13 episode series
How do you normally watch an anime?
They've got plenty of more content to wrap up since October 8th 2020 is when the series ended. So it may take a few years.
Still is pretty good seeing them on top of Beastars
Shit, I was gonna post that
While still having its moments, like how creepy Lucoa is
KyoAni did what it could to try making the source material less saucy I hear.
Nice! I should watch that one soonish. Hear it's really fun.
Is that Non Non Biyori?
True? True.
Her face in this frame lol
Gainax being Gainax <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
https://twitter.com/FemboyFilms/status/1418656761054044160
I'm planning on hopefully knocking out all the anime I have on my PTW
I've been really interested in it for sure, just stuck on having other things to do throughout the day like playing games and all that I tend to forget about watching anime like I wanted to do all Summer.
Gonna hopefully continue my watch of Eizouken today.
Probably nowhere near the amount of roles Ai Kayano scores
Makes me wonder what the average estimate of anime character roles she gets per year is. I think with these numbers, she gets at least 20 a year?
Her peak year being 2019.
By year:

2011: 19
2012: 23
2013:18
2014: 25
2015: 24
2016: 15
2017: 24
2018: 28
2019: 30
2020: 22
2021: 21 (So far)
I counted all of Aoi Yuuki's roles ala AniList since 2011
Decided to remove Utena off my PTW to focus on other anime. Will add it back once I down Shirobako and 3gatsu though
Just seemed like it was bound to get pretty boring.
Ngl I remember dropping Tensura after the lizard war part.
I hear Cinderella Gray is really good.
I should read the manga
Symboli Rudolf's one of the best imo
I just threw Tanya the Evil off my PTW, but might get around to that soon.
Lucky for me, Yuuki Yuuna season 3 starts in October, but I have no idea if Healer Girl is going to pop in during this year or not.
Well, lucky for me there's only 2 months left in the Summer for my great anime teardown
Might actually just finish Eizouken today. Took a long ass time since I was sidetracked with the game I was playing the whole week.
>Looks at voice cast
>Sees Yoko Hikasa and Ai Kayano
Alright, sign me up.
It does look cute as hell.
I hear a bit about that one sometimes
Wasn't New Game that one series Doga Kobo adapted?
Which Konosuba mocked, but also ironically continued to popularize.
Or "Let's try to defeat the big bad"
Mujina vs. Rikka for who has the better thighs
What's one anime episode that gave you chills?
True!
Ohhhh just you wait
It's easily some of the best anime I've consumed.
Season 2 instantly won me over fr
Imo the best of the season.
The Rice Shower episodes are great.
YEAH
She did the thing!
HYPE
Finished Eizouken.
Madoka Madripka
I have yet to watch MagiaReco but hear it isn't great.
I highly recommend just watching Madoka and Rebellion
Since the other 2 movies are recaps
The only movie that matters with Madoka is Rebellion
Easily a very iconic ED in my opinion.
And you start to notice improvements to that as she continues
The only difference with Symphogear is that it was also one of her first times singing
A year
It's comical seeing her go from dark, suffering magical girl to dark, suffering magical girl in like
It was also Aoi Yuuki's breakout role.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sj3fy3J5EHI
Madoka's ED is great too
I personally think that it's very, very good during the last few episodes. And Rebellion kicks a lot of ass.
Haha, then you might get some mileage out of Madoka after all
That this might not have an effect on you
But considering you've watched Symphogear, you're probably so used to "Dark magical girl" stuff
I'd say yes, do watch it.
Considering it has the FMA Brotherhood director behind it and all, I think it could be a slight success.
Studio 3Hz's new project
https://anilist.co/anime/133412/Healer-Girl/
True. I imagine they're only pushing MagiaReco out because of the new movie anyways.
Which has been the case for specific anime coming out like Aquatope having 2 cours.
I don't understand the need to announce a season 3. It feels more like a 2-part single season.
Become Meguca?
But it's probably a bit too late since she's 6 episodes in
I would've recommended Meguca fansubs
Kyoko red haired, Mami blonde, Sayaka blue, and Madoka pink
Yes.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
FUCKING GOD
OH MY
||Get ready to see so many memes about Mami where the one joke is all about her head||
I also know a few friends who like the mobile game story and were pretty iffy on the way it was adapted.
Ahhh.
Oh no not my limbs
Uh oh
LOL
I remember how big of a deal it returning to Adult Swim even was.
Poor Toonami is getting the short end of the stick nowadays, airing not even to 6AM.
But those were normally late night things and more geared towards teens/adults
Tbh anime airing on kids channels isn't common due to Toonami and such
Ohhh
I recall entering the room and he turned to me and said, "FUCK OUTTA HERE"

She didn't tell him about episode 3
I remember my brother's girlfriend got him to watch Madoka
YEP
It's worth noting the artist for Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei, an earlier Shaft anime, also did the art here.
I was like, "OH SHIT? OH SHIT."
That scene was so weirdly satisfying.
You'd need the time for things to sink in.
Mel told me this too. Rebellion isn't really meant to be marathoned.
I recommend waiting at least a week before watching Rebellion
Homura
I was waiting for you to finish to post this masterpiece
https://youtube.com/watch?v=TrgxHDoe8gA
I'm only halfway done with the first episode and Bocchi is a mood.
Ohhh.
Now that you've finished it, I have to show you
Leaking government information in the chat hours less goooo
(Spoilers for both) ||The main character erases themselves from existence, only being remembered by a few people. Where Lain's is a "I'll be here with you" ending, Madoka's is more of a "I'm still here, just not in the memories of everyone who knew me."||
I find it a bit interesting knowing Madoka and Lain have roughly the same ending
In the top 3 of my most cathartic anime scenes
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
And the entire fantasy world before him shattering
"My place from this world disappeared from this world a long time ago. The reality is that there is no place for me anymore. But that's the reality I have to face!"
This scene never fails to send chills down my back.
Even though I finished this one a little while ago
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QYi3BiXOA1I
DMJii shurikens spotted in Bocchi
You can find them on Nyaa, but that's the best upload for Revue Starlight.
<@!436004497542742017> I have a friend who happens to compile the best possible subs into a thing they call "RippleSubs"
Yes.
I know a few people here like this one, so seeing this announcement I figured eh, why not tell 'em
<@!161155855524298752>
https://twitter.com/anime_booklove/status/1423478939469508610?s=19
But KLK is the first 20+ episode I'll watch since a friend of mine has really, really been wanting me to get to it
Since I plan on working my way up
I will get to those soon
This has to be one of my favorite clips
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=40tOfJeC0rg
Just odd how it's the only proper thing people remember it for
Yeah
Apparently Joshiraku is meant to also talk about societal issues the way Zetsubou does
But the clips are cute
I haven't seen it yet
This is the only real thing it's known for
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-8F9xVRNHoU
It's also funny knowing that the creator of this series is also the creator of Joshiraku
Has that studio Shaft style of oddball humor you come to expect before they did Monogatari
Unsure if I'd read it, though. But I like the series enough for the fact it's pretty trippy and the humor can be pretty good at times.
It especially has this really big twist ending
I hear the manga is a lot more morbid
Yeah
I guess SZS scratches that itch of being dark humor, but having enough in the way of parodying to be great
To Zetsubou
I liked the first season a ton
Part of me is afraid of the 20+ episode territory

Oddly enough I haven't been as onboard with "I want to get my PTW finished" as I thought I was
So I'm 6 episodes into Bocchi atm. Plan on wrapping it up soon.
Wrote an entire rant about why he hates it
Like
A friend of mine hates YLIA lol
Nogi Wakaba is a Hero is required imo just for the fact that it helps build on the world
The other 3 are short stories while NoWaYu is a LN that might take you quite a long time to read
What I did was:

Watch YuYuYu S1 and WaSuYu -> Sonoko's Decision/Reminisce/After are required reading -> Nogi Wakaba is DEFINITELY required -> Hero Chapter
Yeah.
Also edited since I copy/pasted from another server
I have yet to read the last one
Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero season 1 -> Washio Sumi is a Hero -> Sonoko's Decision -> Sonoko in Reminiscence -> Sonoko After -> Nogi Wakaba is a Hero -> Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero: Hero Chapter -> Kusunoki Mebuki is a Hero
I do!
But it hasn't received an anime adaptation yet
Nogi Wakaba is a Hero is my personal favorite
Easily *the* 10/10 from the series anime adaptation wise
I highly recommend watching Washio Sumi is a Hero
Ohhhhh
||She was the girl with twin axes on each arm as her hero form.||
||Gin Minowa's death||
The hardest hitter though
Yeahhhh
||God, this scene always hits. Just the music and Fuu wanting to go absolutely lethal on the Taisha. I think YuYuYu is absolutely great in the way it establishes the characters enough for you to feel their pain once it reaches that point.||
(Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero S1) || https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0bjxQMWXsRE ||
Ooh I was going to hope you watched Rebellion
NoWaYu is too good to be just a LN/Manga
Hoping after season 3 or something
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
3 episodes the first day, last 3 the second.
Not even a few days.
I spent almost a month reading NoWaYu and I remember binging Hero Chapter in like a few days
Hero Chapter I wish was longer fr
I'm lucky to have gotten into the franchise last year when people had a ton of fan translations
True
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
A scene that hit me the most
Gin's death was like
Aside that, I really liked Gin and Sonoko
I think that's why I loved it so much
^
Gunchan <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>
But seriously y'all should read Nogi Wakaba is a Hero. Imo the best written story for Yuuki Yuuna
Ooh yeah, those are good
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It adds context to several things, especially since it's a prequel that takes place before even WaSuYu
It does
Unforgivable
I can't believe Homura evaded doing her taxes
That "Homura was never a good person" one?
So it's as if Shaft is thinking of it as an afterthought. Rushing it out the door before movie 4
Doesn't help that Magia Record season 2 atm is one of those 2 cour projects. Atm season 2 is airing, but season 3 airs in December.
Mainly those who've played the mobile game and enjoy it or those who enjoy Madoka in general, but weren't impressed by it.
I haven't seen it myself yet, though a few friends tell me to stay away from it regardless.
Sora Yori is my favorite
So many good reaction images
Tyvm!
I'm going through all the smaller ones atm. All the 12/13 episodes first.

Really fun and cute.
Was an 8/10 imo.
Juuuust finished Bocchi.
I occasionally peek at what's being talked about, but I'm hyper focused on my backlog before Fall starts.
Tbf I haven't been paying attention to any anime due to backlog-chan.
In the eyes of a typical weeb, would you rather watch a romcom that's got cute girls in it or some show about giris in an opera school? Keyword: typical
Look at Rent a Girlfriend from last year
Romcom garbage of the Summer tends to reel in the viewership.
I just get a little too emotional talking about WEP and its infinite amount of potential.
Sorry.
WEP went from an ambitious and genuinely refreshing anime original to a somber disappointment in what felt like the blink of an eye. What could've been potentially one of the best "Hidden gem" anime wrapped up in an anti-climactic and awful way with the special.
What I dislike about WEP:

1. The storytelling post-episode 7 feels like it goes about nowhere. The writer is notorious for using touchy subject matters as a means to seek attention than tell a message with it, and these later episodes were evidence of it.
2. On the topic of writing, WEP has a few very cool ideas it *never* touches on. Dream syncing was cool, but it never gets used again. Parallel realities are explored in episode 12, but it's done too little too late. Dream syncing was about the closest this series ever got to touching Flip Flappers, and it was a mere light poke.
3. Where the girls are great characters and get along, I feel they really don't have set arcs? Whatever troubles them in an episode immediately gets resolved and they have little to no development at all.
4. People compare it to Flip Flappers for Frill being a last minute addition and the ending being bad. But unlike FliFla, Mimi was foreshadowed since the beginning, and the ending to Flip Flappers **had a purpose instead of shitting itself into the void.**
Those are the cherry on top.
Yeah.
^
With how it handled LGBT themes and other touchy subject matters in the beginning I was thinking, "Ya know? This is it. This anime has potential to be really, really good."
But it's overall still something that has sorely disappointed me. And it was one of the first actual anime I watched weekly.
I'm sure I can think of more
Well, there are a few things redeemable about WEP imo:

1. The first 7 or so episodes were great. Aside the greatly choreographed action and storytelling, they were nicely written.
2. The soundtrack by De De Mouse. This lad needs a new back for carrying this series singlehandedly with the soundtrack.
3. An interesting concept very similar to Flip Flappers, which was my draw to it at first.
If anything, the only thing redeemable about it to me now is the characters. Since I actually enjoyed the chemistry of the main 4.
Imo the first few episodes were great.
And as a guy who's been moderating the Wonder Egg server since March, I can definitely say the change in opinion was evident.
But I see most people say that WEP dropped off after episode 7.
Episode 10 was good imo because I liked any Momoe episode
The quality of the series took a dive by around the 8th episode because they got a little too pretentious.
Now you can get disappointed in English *or* Japanese!

I use this on my phone for watching anime. It's really reliable there, but I don't know about PC.
https://mpv.io
Especially since a friend of mine has been wanting me to watch it for the longest time
Liz is gonna be really fun
Finally gonna start Hibike/Liz this week
Tyvm!
Ooh nice.
Ahhh true.
Has there ever been a magical school deconstruction the way Konosuba decosntructs isekai or Madoka deconstructs mahou shojo?
Not in the way Netflix, Disney+, etc. are.
Crunchyroll as a service hasn't proved themselves prime for hosting "original" content imo
Yes. But even that is pretty up in the air.
It was just showing the people behind it.
TL;DR people got upset by it because "My money is being spent towards THIS?" and the trailers didn't really show what the anime was about.
^
Just wish that the script was rewritten or something, since this sounds very by-the-numbers.
The art style is very nice.
Yeah.
Why keep this stowed away for 3 years and change nothing about it when you could've rewritten it to be something not generic?
And playing them straight.
But here, you can see it's taking those tropes common in other series like RWBY, LWA, etc.
You look at Madoka or Konosuba and notice that it parodies its genres.
But it's the most typical "Magical girl school" thing I've seen. And imo, they could've properly done something more with it.
It looks alright imo
https://youtu.be/1FpbxiAUSW8

Imo the storybook stuff is great. Though the school stuff can be pretty slow, they are beginning to pick up.
Gdi this movie is beautiful so far.
I'd love to see the Drachma attempting to pursue Rahknam scene animated
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
We've only seen so little of that game's world aside from Abe/Munch's continent and Stranger's continent
Lorne Lanning has even said he wants to make an Oddworld series.
I'd personally love seeing Oddworld get an animated series
Niiiice.

If any video game could be made into an anime/TV series, what would you want to see get made?
I just do happen to like both of those.
Well
<:OgawaRead:688429716507721770>
But I hear Zetsubou and Monogatari are somewhat similar.
Oh yeah also Madoka recently
Since I watched Zetsubou Sensei, I do generally enjoy Shaft's weirdness
So I try to shift my attention to one and keep at that one
Normally I just take anime one watch at a time because when I watch 2 at the same time, it kinda gets a bit jumbled for me I guess?
Aside just adding the new Tatami anime, I still have a long ways to go
And I remember thinking unwinding the thread for Yuuki Yuuna's watching order (Not relying on anime only) was a little complicated lol
But knowing where to jump in and how to watch seems weird
It looks nice
But I'm ehh...
I have heard high praise of Monogatari from the Animemes server
He's pretty much going to get stuck on what to do with life if one thing goes wrong
But at the same time, it is good at symbolizing how he is beginning to realize each time he resets the timeline
The only string of episodes I do find to somewhat drag on is the episode where Watashi keeps resetting the timeline to see who he ends up with
My favorite episode was the health supplements one or the English conversation circle
Or how Ozu always causes trouble
There are still the repetitious elements that appear, like the Fortune Teller who's yen price for fortunes goes up each episode
My favorite aspect about Tatami is how each episode is something different, but the characters all know one another.
"Search for the circle to learn how not to become a circle" hits deep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipNvicMYSX0
Tatami stuck out to me the most with its messages.
Tatami is an anime I love to bits. Aside Symphogear, Sora Yori, and other stuff I saw last year
Fr
Not really worried at all tbh since he pretty much understands Yuasa's vision if he's worked on those before.
Shingo Natsume was a storyboard/key animator on Tatami and Night is Short. 2 episodes of Tatami, and a storyboarder for Night is Short.

There's that horse that got cut because it was getting a bit *too* close with Hishi Amazon
Oguri shown with her eating habit since the first trailer, that looks to be Teio
There's a lot of early horse girl designs here
So weird looking at all the early Uma designs
The metarex stuff was at least good from what I remember
Too bad the anime itself isn't as good as the OP.
I still find it absolutely comical that the DBZ guy sings the OP

The character designer *and* writer of Lain?
I'm thinking of watching this soon when my PTW slims down
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3SzOzm8lmo
Dub Lain sounded really nasal-y.
I've watched the actual dub already, and I like how Eiri sounded enough. But this Eiri sounded pretty solid.
This was... surprisingly solid for a fandub.
Holy shit.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1CxXrH3jtBc
This does look rad, even if it isn't an Uma ripoff.
Which looks cool af
Could be a serialization of this

https://twitter.com/livedoornews/status/1428995404968849411?s=19
I hear combatants, another story by the author is good.
True
It's funny how the tropes they parody became mainstays in the genre
But after watching a lot of stuff and looking at Isekai now, I can say Konosuba is pretty overrated
I remember it being the anime that got me back into anime.
But if we're getting a S3, Daiwa/Vodka is the most rational option
I imagine it'll be a year or two
Yessss
Btw this was to my surprise written by the same author as Monogatari, Nisio
God, this was such a good read.
Mom told me she was running a house by age 13. This is some next level shit!
This is exactly what I was saying
Like it'll get a crowd talking I guess.
It looks uh...
I saw the PV in <#407060923078017026> awhile ago
^
So she hooked me up with fansubs she tailored together with a few people, and now it's one of my all time favorites.
Then someone told me "Don't watch the official subs"
I knew someone who recommended Revue. Watched it. Loved it.
I love it.
It's in my top 11 on AniList
^
Could get back to it soon.
Tyvm
I just paused Euphonium
Ooh. It does sound nice. I'm probably going to watch the anime eventually. I'm just in the midst of trying to get through Hibike Euphonium while fighting burnout.
Not that I make it a huge list, anyway. I just throw things on I know I want to watch and remove things either out of wanting to get to it later or just thinking it takes up space
I'll definitely watch the anime soon. I'm just doing what I can so I don't just leave something on my PTW that won't take me years to finish.
At this point I've gone from "I'll watch all this by maybe September" to "Fuck. Burnout is bad. I'll cut corners to be ready for things."
Figured I'd cut GLT from my PTW since it's already a manga I plan to read.
Who knew controversy sells?
Np!
Happy birthday!
Maybe I'll pick it up again soon, but I have struggled on and off with burnout relating to specifically anime
Yeahhh, I think pausing Hibike atm has been a nice idea
I've heard good things about AKB0048
AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
YUYUYU S3 TRAILER
https://youtu.be/A5HBW28mt9I
But imo it is a series with good worldbuilding all around.
I'd say only read Nogi Wakaba since that's the best extra piece of material
Without Nogi Wakaba, certain things in Hero Chapter might not stick out as much. Some of the short stories also help to build up the world, but not as much as Nogi Wakaba. Don't want to delve into why for spoiler reasons, but know it's a great read.
Sad how we might not get an adaptation since it's a very good LN. Though I've heard some mixed things on the manga.
Nogi Wakaba is notably the best piece of Yuuki Yuuna media.
I remember being given a reading order for YuYuYu. S1 was the start, a few short stories, then Washio Sumi, then Nogi Wakaba is a Hero followed by another short story, then Hero Chapter
Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero
God, I'm hyped.
And some chick that's in Bandori
Saw the ED earlier, and to my surprise Nana Mizuki is onboard here too
Speaking of music themed anime, I have heard good things about D4DJ
At least PriPri, Flip Flappers, and I hear Blackfox is good
You could in general say that for anything Studio 3Hz makes
I imagine people are going to give this anime a more positive look retrospectively because it is imo a hidden gem that deserves more eyes than it gets.
We weren't going fast paced. We wanted some things to wrap the story up with, and we were getting it. Seeing ||MImi|| after episodes of foreshadowing felt like a nice payoff after a long ass time of Papika and Cocona doing their thing of kicking ass and trying to get shards.
Flip Flappers does feel rushed towards the end, but it feels like a decent kick of pacing with the series overall.
One person I saw said it was great until the plot got involved at the end... but imo I disagree.
I find it saddening seeing some people's criticisms towards Flip Flappers later half
A visual treat for the eyes, and a heartfelt and wonderful story with kickass action.
And it's pretty much at the top of my favorite all time anime
I recall watching it immediately after PriPri last year
~~Watch Flip Flappers, it's god tier~~
God, that shit was good.
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Episode 9's ending, then the episodes after with ||Mimi|| rising
YES
I haven't seen this one yet
LMAO
A Place Further Than the Universe
There is a manga adaptation which I hear isn't bad, but I read the LN
Good LN stuff
Can recommend one piece of side content for YuYuYu: Nogi Wakaba is a Hero
Yep
I recall wanting to
Didn't even see that Milim character everyone likes since I was just kinda bored with it.
I just kinda dropped it
Yeah... once I neared the point where they started to have the "Rimuru runs a nation" thing
It's a ride or die isekai I suppose
But I lost interest at about the halfway point
YuYuYu as a whole imo doesn't deserve to be compared to Madoka.
I decided to finally watch Symphogear again and finish it
And after I finished the YuYuYu franchise (save reading KuMeYu and other works)
This was during the time where I hadn't thought to rewatch the 3 seasons of Symphogear I had watched yet
Yuuki Yuuna is an anime that I watched due to really good friends recommending me it.
Honestly glad you enjoyed it.
There's like 2 seasons and another movie. And I'm not sure if I want to just finish that.
I'm just... eh?
I don't hate the series mind you
Questioning if I should drop Hibike Euphonium or not
Them <:CagliostroSmile:672861875385401344>
Started to rewatch a favorite from last year.
Episode 4 is cute.
I love how Karin's is just the most straightforward
There is more history to her, but again that's spoilers
Spoiler territory. But she and the main cast all live.
Of course.
It's a dark magicial girl anime.
Ahhh episode 3 of WaSuYu. The last moment before they ripped the bandaid and reminded you that you were watching girls suffer.
I love that scene.
She's also incredibly patriotic to Japan.
This is a golden reaction image
This moment is still cute af
||"I'M GOING TO KILL THE TAISHA!"||
||I remember the first time that scene with Fuu happened and she broke down. God, that one hurts every time.||
||I remember when I watched episode 4 originally, I totally forgot about Itsuki recording the audition song. And the "Death" tarot card being *incredibly* ominous.||
Though certain elements really stick out on a rewatch.
Can't wait to continue my rewatch of YuYuYu today. So far I'm pretty much enjoying it just as I did a year ago.
This doesn't really spoil too much, but it's a spoiler no less.
Ohhh right sorry.
This is kinda like Bikki's amalgam form but done before even GX.
||I am admittedly a little worried with season 3. Since Nogi Wakaba ended with the remaining heroes cherishing what time they had left before passing on, I question if the fights are just going to be small things, or if things will be comfy.||
||Oh. Now that makes sense. Gin is part of the reason why I have WaSuYu at a 10, anyways. It's such an emotional series and Gin's death was such a heartbreaking moment. Aside the ending.||
||Oh that sucks. The sword axes were pretty much one of the things I loved about Gin to begin with. That's sacrilege if you have Gin's terminal and don't use those cool ass things!||
||I am currently rewatching the anime portions for a reason. I forgot to screenshot my way through S1 and WaSuYu, so some details are a bit hazy.||
||True. That was one of the things I remember from Sonoko in Reminisce. Was a very golden moment and it kind of made sense when you looked at Karin's style of fighting.||
The latter easily the longest
I have a friend who's pretty staunch on people needing to cover the side material. Eileen does at least make it so you don't have to read *everything* to understand it, just a few short stories, one short clip from a gacha (apparently canon since it takes place in the middle of an episode), and a light novel
But overall, I quite love Yuuki Yuuna in spite of its flaws. It's just a shame that with how it's directed anime-wise and how content is scattered across multiple non-anime works, convincing people to get into it is a little hard.
(Hero Chapter spoilers) ||It's a shame that Yuuki Yuuna anime-wise does leave a few details under the rug. I don't think they explained why Sonoko is suddenly better and with the heroes as of Hero Chapter aside a throwaway line saying "Oh hey, Sonoko's back!"||
||Nogi Wakaba is one of the few side materials I think should've been adapted into an anime. It's seriously one of the best LN I've read, and I encourage those interested in the franchise to pick it up. It's great.||
||Personally I enjoyed S1's ending a lot more when I saw how Washio Sumi is a Hero wrapped up. But it's pretty sad knowing you kinda have to read side material to get the full gist of things.||
Yeah, where I love YuYuYu, S1's ending is mixed
||This scene is great. The music crescendoing at the revelation, the buildup, and wonderfully spoken dialogue from Sonoko. God, I love YuYuYu.||
Haruka Terui is cute. She really brings the energy of Yuuna to a lot of her characters
Ohhh
Itsuki's seiyuu is Phos in Land of the Lustrous and Kumiko in Sound Euphonium
Kana Hanazawa and Suzuko Mimori are the two I immediately think of when I think seiyuus in YuYuYu
He's talking about the cast overall not just her.
Very good detail on making Tougou's wheelchair wheels larger to keep it afloat in water.
(Yuuki Yuuna) ||Ah yes, my favorite. Yuuki Yuuna Tests Positive for the Coronavirus"||
~~And with Princess Principal releasing that same year, why watch?~~
A shame since I liked the other story the author did, Yuuki Yuuna
I wanted to watch this but hear it's not worth the watch or something
Heroines on heroin
I hear it's gonna be about magical girls using drugs
Like daaayum, this Dorothy stylin'
Princess Principal afaik didn't have a turn based gacha, it was a totally different one but it had some cool looking variations of the characters
Love Live, Symphogear, Assault Lily, Yuuki Yuuna, Uma Musume
~~Turn based combat? Jazz music? Is this Pe-~~
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdIjFi-S458
Wait no, it was the opposite
Funny enough I remember reading it had a mobile game that collabed with Yuuki Yuuna's
So maybe eventually soon
It does look fun.
Currently rewatching YuYuYu before S3, will be watching Sangatsu, then after that maybe KLK since a friend has wanted me on that for awhile
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641> I guess when I eventually get things wrapped up and have nothing else, I'll give it a go

The "What? Holy shit!" from Madoka got me rolling
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5GHsnrHNRRU
Perhaps
Aoi Yuuki is in everything nowadays
Like with PriPri
Or make a string of movies in place of seasons.
The aesthetic of The Duel is pretty damn good, and the color palette used is also just as good. Black and white with hints of color make for a fantastic experience.
The Duel, The Twins, and The Village Bride are absolutely <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
I watched through most of the new Star Wars Visions shorts released today
And I remember one of my first anime was Naruto
I could never get into MHA personally
"Mom, can we get Borderlands?"
"We have Borderlands at home!"
Borderlands at home:
God this looks ugly
I genuinely question what they were thinking
YuYuYu S3 üëÄ
Shit looks like it's animated on watered down Gary's Mod
I've only seen the GIFs of Ex-ARM
||The saddest moment in the series imo, easily #1 with Fuu's breakdown in episode 9 of S1 being second place.||
||Every time I think about it||
||God that scene hits like a truck||
<:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
Washi do be cute
||Washio Sumi is my favorite season. God there's specific scenes that happen later that just really hurt.||
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
LET'S ENJOY
Great stuff
The composers of YuYuYu's OST made the Nier Automata soundtrack
Are you excited for Hero Chapter?
Haruka Terui does a great job at bringing so much passion and klutziness to her character
Yuuna is a cutie
"Oh, you liked Yuuki Yuuna S1 and thought these girls weren't going to suffer afterwards? Prequel time, bitch!"
Washio Sumi is a Hero is basically like a jack-in-the-box with a boxing glove inside
<:PrefectPain:804768067506012170>
Thanks for that YuYuYu and Tsubasa
Funny enough by the time I watched Madoka I was so used to magical girls suffering I didn't really feel too much.
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
If you want I can give a brief summary on one of the short stories
||Side content explains why Sonoko is there, and does also include a few stories from her perspective.||
Aww RIP
Without spoilers, they don't explain why a certain character is there now
Otherwise going into Hero Chapter you might be a little confused
If you haven't read the side stories yet, I can recommend it
That's without spoilers.
Going to be in for a ride.
You're... Oh boy...
They're all good.
Junna, Nana, Karen, uh...
Mahiru do be my favorite girl
She's seen it
Revue do be top tier
Haven't watched Utena but the OP slaps
But I haven't seen that one yet
I've heard Princess Tutu did the "Dark magical girl" thing before Madoka
<:pika:666445120429752350> üéâ
Tbh I'm sure that's just me being biased because I already like the games
Kirby anime was unironically good tho
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Then again they turned the guns in Yu-Gi-Oh into fingerguns
https://tenor.com/view/kirby-anime-firing-shooting-gun-gif-16579464
Also yeah Kirby with a gun idk why they'd remove it
And say a few random lines that aren't "Poyo"
Like I guess the creator didn't want Kirby to talk, and in the sub he does sing the ED during one episode
Aside removing some text here and there and altering a few jokes, I've seen some people say the dub>sub for a few instances.
This was surprisingly the only 4Kids dub that wasn't severely butchered
Not sure if they did episodes for Air Ride
Air Ride?
I think they also did uhhhhh
I do like how they used it to adapt Nightmare in Dreamland
Yes
If this happens I will totally watch this anime
Is it as good as Gridman?
I should watch that soon
Ooh
So this looks a lot more like it'll be on the lines of Interspecies Reviewers if anything
The series goal is that 4 dudes have to repopulate the world and get with incredibly horny women
Makes me question what in the world's going on
This delay only adds to it.
I hear that the production for this one overall's been wonky
"Shit. Redo of a Healer already filled the "Problematic anime spot" this year. We gotta move."
https://twitter.com/uma_musu/status/1448121855538204681
That's actually kind of cool
Daaamn
Also where Pantera got the video for Planet Caravan from, which lead to YouTube blocking any clips of it throughout the years. But that aside, it's really impressive seeing really early CGI
This is really cool
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5zMtCvWhG0
Yeah I should actually get around to watching it
"It didn't fit the brand" They say, while they also had Star Vs.
That's weird. If they thought it didn't "fit the brand" they would've ended it sooner than season 1
Also I can't belieev that the sequel to Tatami is gonna be on D+
Wait wtf they did
Iirc it was something about Pony Canyon being pretty stingy with its properties. From what I've heard of the S1 dub it isn't half bad, but it's a shame they didn't start working on WaSuYu or Hero Chapter.
That's strange.
Oh pog

The music that plays when ||Yuuna goes Dai Mankai|| is just fucking beautiful

I know that they're apparently using the characters from that but doing something different with them
I still need to read KuMeYu for one
Ooh thanks.
I've been binging Monk so I still have YuYuYu S1 on pause. Apparently I hear it's really really good. Even tossing in some of the side material characters into the mix.
How is YuYuYu S3?
Awww this is a cute nod.
https://twitter.com/gb_donglees/status/1450386245805355008
Konosuba fans when I don't laugh at their same 5 jokes
Season 1 and 2 have like a 7 and 6/10 on my AniList. Can't be arsed to watch the movie.
I remember initially liking Konosuba and it got me back into anime. Now years later after having watched a lot more, I just kinda fell out of being a "fan" of the series
Hard agree
You're either a power fantasy or a parody
I blame Konosuba. It's kind of funny an anime that parodies isekai laid the groundwork for isekai being the way it is now
"I Died, And Miraculously Revived as a Durex‚Ñ¢Ô∏è Condom"
Isekai names start to feel like they're getting more self aware
And that aside I'd actually *have* to rewatch PriPri
I should watch Crown Handler but I'm gonna wait til the third one releases
They looking like paper cutouts
Lmao
Season 2 is just 2 parts. Hero Chapter is part 2.
Definitely a must play if you really like JRPGs.
I've talked about how much I like the game before. Hell, I love it so much that my status is a quote from the main character
I just want to see ||Drachma's sacrifice|| animated
Definitely deserves an anime adaptation.
It's got basic JRPG turn based combat, but the pirate ship fights are really good
It's a great game
Then I hear it wasn't so great.
I recall a few people on the WEP server I mod watching this one called Idoly Pride. The description really looked like it could've been that.

Devil is a part timer, Konosuba, Madoka movie 4,  I can't think of anything else
This is the year of long awaited sequels getting new projects announced.
"Wow guys real life is just like a video game!" is what that title is reminding me of
"Landlord-chan, sorry I missed my rent!"
I should probably get on that
Don't even make the goal "They need to kill the big bad", just give me a guy trying to figure out how a world entirely brutal works.
Seeing something where they aren't in a power fantasy setting or get a harem would be nice
From my knowledge yeah
But I looked at it and heard a lot about it to the point of not really wanting to see it
Honestly I cannot wait for that day. I do see people saying "Omg Mushukou Tensei is so great!"
Dropped it due to not being too interested. Seemed like it was gonna get boring.
I recall watching Slime Isekai up until its midpoint in S1
Ok fair
Ahh yeah
Konosuba was something I did generally like until its retroactive effect of "The self aware version of (x)" started to be milked by the same genre giving us fantasy harem
The idea of an Isekai being this escape from realiy opens up so much doors. Then you have the ones that are either fantasy harems like a good majority, or something like Konosuba that mocks its tropes
There is always going to be something big everything will copy tropes from and then not really flesh it out.
Good points.
^
Where I do like AXZ, there's no fault in denying yeah... it did feel rough around the edges.
GX and AXZ I feel suffer most because where they're both good in a few spots, I feel they're rough overall writing wise since they value spectacle over substance
Since its scope and ambitions are admirable despite its choppy animation
I did initially feel mixed about S1, it's imo one of the best seasons to rewatch
Ah true
Symphogear is like a Summer blockbuster. Generally ludicrous, but enjoyable, mindless entertainment.
Symphogear I personally think is one of my all time favorite series. It's the most balls to the wall crazy thing I've watched, and where I do criticize it for certain things *cough* GX *wheeze*, it is still overall a series I enjoy.
But from the hype train perspective, Symphogear was great
Nowadays I'm a bit more critical towards it since I do get pretty invested in discussions about the anime
I only picked it up since someone I know really really liked to shill it.
And apparently the new season is taking one of the LNs and refreshing it for audiences who either read it thinking it'd be the same or are watching the anime.
A lot of the side material is great honestly.
Yuuki Yuuna isn't for everyone. I really enjoy it, but it's definitely a series that I guess you need to be into to be into if you get what I mean
Perfectly ok imo
Wouldn't blame you
With Madoka you can just watch the full series then Rebellion and you're set
Like how Yuuki Yuuna does require a bit of side reading to understand things in the main anime with Hero Chapter.
It is one of my favorites, but I do think Madoka does have a few things over it
||Tougou is treated really well in season 1 imo. I like how her transformation lets her stand up for one. And they always find ways to try and get over her disability, i.e. she can't swim due to her legs being screwed, so she's given a floaty instead which is honestly a really charming detail.||
||Eh? ||
i.e. one of the main characters has a sister also participating in it
Madoka is great, but Yuuki Yuuna is just strong with its worldbuilding and in general is deeper. Where Madoka has magical girls suffering, Yuuki Yuuna is the same. But it feels more personal.
I love it a lot more than Madoka
YuYuYu is rad
I want an epilogue at least. Establish the people we spent 65 episodes with are happy.
It's a nice sendoff to the series, but it just... felt rushed.
I did really like the ending too
The pacing, Tsubasa having another trauma arc, the wimpy ass sendoff of Noble Red
That's kinda how I feel. It's good to me for its way of tying things up, but its deepest issues really keep it from being an incredibly satisfying ending.
Maria vs. Tsubasa was dope tho
Would have been cool to see mind controlled Basa fighting the users
And Tsubasa's arc was just... eh?! You have the balls to kill a kid on screen, but you don't have them to show us more of Tsubasa breaking down?
The other episodes just felt like dicking around until Shem-Ha came up
I did like episode 1's pacing since it was establishing things at least.
Then it got slow
But what I disliked was how episode 1 and 2 started strong...
XV was a 9/10 in my book but what kept it from a 10 was the way that it had a lot of stumbles. Episode 13 ending wise I did really really like.
They decimated an entire concert venue, something Maria was conflicted on in G. It was a nice way to follow up on what people thought was going to happen in G.
At least Noble Red did *something* to establish themselves as a threat
They were that forgettable
I recall my first time around not even remembering the Autoscorers names save Micha
This
^
Cags is great. Her seiyuu, Aoi Shouta, absolutely killed it.
Change the Future was a dope song
I can thank AXZ for making me get into MariChris at least <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
As EpicLinkSam once said, "There are two big reasons why AXZ is remembered"
~~I'm literally a Sonic fan, so take my opinions as you will~~
Mine is like:

S1 = G>XV>AXZ>GX
AXZ was basically "Shit. We need plot for this season, right?"
^
^
^
Because its scope and ambitions are directed so fluidly
Like I said, season 1 imo manages to be one of the best seasons if we're talking story/lore
<:woWonayiM:833581261925908510>
I sure do hope it doesn't start off promising and go to shit in later episodes
Oh boy, a new Cloverworks production
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUfoZt0FHMc
Most characters make reference to metal/rock and I fuckin' love it
Guilty Gear is a game series that felt like it was made for me
As someone who does struggle with the past at times, I do really enjoy how they handled Chris getting over that.
One thing I did like about AXZ that does keep me from disliking it is Chris' arc
Oh yeah agreed
"Symphogear AXZ, but I'm playing a game the entire time until Adam shows up"
Well yeah, when you're sitting there waiting for buff man with spirit bombs to stop doing fuck all for most of the runtime, of course it's barren.
Seasons like GX and AXZ especially needed a longer time or a rewrite or two so they'd at least be nothing more than spectacle over substance
That chalks down the biggest problem with Symphogear imo
^
I can't believe they'd allow Sunrise to animate manslaughter like that smh
https://twitter.com/funimation/status/1454100851492995074?s=21
Now that list is looking bigger
I remember when I looked at her AniList and saw post-XV and even before how she had a ton of roles
Just do it 12 oz. Mouse style and animate the entire fucking thing on a $5 budget
I recall hearing DITF wasn't received too well towards the end like WEP
Promised Neverland season 2 and Wonder Egg Priority really instill fear into anything Cloverworks now
Cloverworks is under Aniplex, which greatly explains their mismanagement
This is generally why I have nothing bad to say about Studio 3Hz. Flip Flappers, Princess Principal, I should get around to Blackfox.
Wasted Potential Priority
Aka
And Wonder Egg
"Steven Universe 2: Queer Harder" fuckin' killed me
Like most western anime outrage is
Tbf most of the outrage are the stupid "SJWs r ruining the media!" channels
Since you-know-what
So maybe re-recording/recording lines was an issue
Tbf this was an anime that was stuck around since 2018
They were too afraid to do anything after the initial backlash in 2018
Well tbf this anime was left in the vaults of Crunchyroll hell for awhile
The writing definitely doesn't feel like my thing, but it doesn't look that bad animation wise.
It seems ok at best.
My favorite
A Place Further Than the Universe
Oh yes. My bad.
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Then this happens.
For a time I thought, "Maybe the people still salty about GamerGate will move on and just be clowned on"
Honestly a great read.
It feels off putting to anime only watchers.
Where those side stories are great
Yes. The biggest fault in YuYuYu is that side stories feel mandatory to understanding the anime at times.
Ohh. Yeah fair then
Well... that was half a season at least.
I really liked the light novel and think it'd be a great service to just make a prequel season since they did it before with WaSuYu
I'm not watching S3 yet but when I heard about it, I honestly feel NoWaYu deserves its own season.
"Local Yukine Appreciator found dead after MAL list revealed their thoughts on Jojo"
I guess this could go into <#337805317276565525> I dunno
Whoa
On my own TF2 is my most played
My little brother would play on my account when I had to share, so GMod is my most plaed
Ahh fair.
CHRIST
JESUS
10.9 hours I could've spent rewatching Yuuki Yuuna and starting something on my list <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
https://anilist.co/user/DasAntihero/
Ahhh I see.
I can only watch one
How can you juggle watching 21 anime at the same time?
Holy smokes
SHIT
HOLY
This is all I have now.
When I started Hibike, I was on an anime burnout. And then it just stayed paused for so long. Sound Euphonium might be a "Will watch at a way later date" thing.
Maybe? I dunno.
I do have YuYuYu paused as well, but I want to actually get back to rewatching that.
I had this paused for so long, but eh.
It's 7:15PM here on 11/2, but I'll be sure to send my bday wishes
Ohhh I can tell
Are you going to watch Stone Ocean just to rate it low?
Should give it a watch tomorrow since I'm winding down for the night.
No. Apparently it's on their YouTube channel
I haven't heard much about Adult Swim in awhile. Aside Rick and Morty and finding out 12 Oz. Mouse has a third season, I've not been paying attention as much.
TIL that's a thing
^
Revue is def something I should rewatch
Oh right, I should sort that anime list out and replace AXZ with G maybe
I also really like the profile layout.
AniList works pretty solidly. Not much else to say. I didn't use MAL prior, but was told that MAL is kinda outdated in most regards, with AniList being an easier means to sort through things. I don't personally mind the old school look of MAL because, ya know, I like old shit. With AniList, however, I really like the design of the homepage. No nonsense relating to "Enter this contest!", forums and reviews are all in one place, etc.
On the talk of AniList>MAL, I'd like to say that all the points mentioned are pretty much why I like AniList.
That's another good feat with AniList
^
The amount of hate it's getting is pretty asinine. I see far less people saying "It's not bad, just plainly generic" and more "Omg it's woke cartoon anime!" From the hive mind that is Anituber sheep that watch Hero Hei and Rev
Tbh I think HGS is ok. Nothing too impressive, but nothing too offensive. Just a typical magical girl show overloaded with tropes.
So funky
Most likely it'd focus on Vodka and Daiwa, but Dia and Kita would make for a good focus too.
That'd be dope
Dunno how much I'd trust CR with Uma Global, but I imagine with how the popularity is at its peak, it sure as hell should come soon.
That'd be great really.
Not sure when we'll get a season 3, but I sure do hope it takes less time than 2.
But it by no means is bad.
I guess my issue with S1 is that it has too many tropes that you'll sit there and think, "Oh yeah I knew this was coming."
^
What I enjoy about Uma Musume is its combination of all these different races at times in the horse history.
Well, in a way yeah. But it's nothing if you're into the actual horse history.
Oh yeah S1 Trainer is just *why*
My issue with season 1 is that it plays it too safe at times. Which, yeah. That's understandable considering it was meant to launch alongside a mobile game.
S1 has its gut punches, but S2 decides to use both its fists and rapidly hit you in the gut. Even when you're kinda expecting it.
Yes.
S2 was one of the admittedly too many 10/10's I've given an anime. But it's well deserved.
Hope you enjoy it. Season 1 isn't the best, but it's fun. Season 2 is really, really freaking good though.
Yeah.
You just don't sit on a project people finished for years because of outcry. Shit like Sonic Boom and that new Bubsy get released in the games industry despite outcry that it's simply something most people think shouldn't exist.
Honestly what I was thinking in the first place happened
Kita, Sweek, now Pasa. Good shit.
Wonderful.
More praise stickers got added, huh?
El Condor Pasa was the best in S1
What's your favorite horse, <#371105434771390465>?
Teio or Nice Nature
Probably uhhh
Like how my favorite horse is uhhh
You can totally start one.
Oh yeah that makes sense
So that means Cartoon Network and DC are under the same branch
HBOMax is owned by Warner
S1's biggest strength is that its characters pick up the scraps to an otherwise safe sports story. I was always more intrigued to see a new horse girl in each episode and the bonds of team Spica than I was interested in the overall narrative. And that's kinda what makes S2 better. It dives more into its characters - mainly the focus of that season - but it makes their stories a lot more gripping.
Exactly same opinion too.
Oh hey, same rating!
Phar Lap sounds pretty good
Uma Musume has so many possibilities, and quite frankly I hope they do some deep cuts.
Honestly makes me think of a subplot they could throw in considering Bourb that that yakuza trainer guy
Holy shit
True
The rest of her racing was just lip service for JP racing fans
They only did that with Suzuka because they couldn't really write much with her IRL history wise.
Fair.
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Can imagine they'd just pull a "You're going to America" card with Teio or McQueen in S3
Considering Suzuka was dead after that one race, I imagine that they'd have to come up with something.
~~Urara for maximum laughs~~
Just because the main 3 seiyuus are LL seiyuus so we made jokes a lot
I recall on WEPcord we changed it to a LL server on April Fools day
^
I can't wait for all the possible horse girls to be added, then there's just Turbo in the corner.
No Yuuki Yuuna honse for my anime only ass <:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
Wish we'd get Zenno Rob Roy screentime, but she's mobile game atm
McTeio good
But I really enjoyed Teio. Twin Turbo was great too.
So it's understandable
Rice did have one of the best episodes of S2
<:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
I should actually listen to the starting gate album but I don't listen to anime music too often
Weed horse
||God, that gets me wanting to watch S3 just to see how they change up NoWaYu.||
Since Cloverworks is owned by Sony, that about explains how they get the budget to do that.
Yeah. Wonder Egg
Boy, a Cloverworks original premiering in the Winter season. I sure do wonder what could go wrong
Yep
Twin Turbo is easily a top 10 character for season 2
Oh god
Being Uma is suffering
Umayon is great
All that time just to say "Oh yeah I'm making a piece based on your character"
I imagine filing a ticket or tweeting at the creator would take ages.
It is a stupid take tbh. And if that were to happen, how would people go about it?
And they won't be hitting me with hot dog stands and bulldozers like the games, right?
As for creations someone makes, they're doing it out of really liking the character.
There's already restrictions on Uma Musume characters and hentai, but that's understandable since they're based on real horses.
^
Do they work for NIntendo or something?
"Oh wow that's a nice chair."
"Sure is, but it's missing a hole for the horse girl tail."
All of a sudden people are having to build shit specifically for them
If Uma Musume takes place in a world where famous race horses are resurrected as horse girls, I can't imagine what that world was like prior.
Gdi Mel, your twisted jokes often make my day
So the early ancestors were all turned into glue <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Banana only girl with ||time manipulation powers||
2 of those 4 have about one thing in common
^
British spy girls
Spy girls need more love tbh
I'm surprised HiDive simuldubbed it and how sloppy the official subs are.
Since I watched with the initial subs. It was... eh...
Just be glad RippleSubs, or fansubs for Revue, exist.
I've got it at a 10/10 but it's definitely got some issues later in spots.
I should genuinely rewatch it soon
I've heard nothing but good things
Eileen will be delighted to hear someone is watching for the first time
Yep!
In the first episode I recall seeing them all trying to cram those in but it just looked weird, especially for characters that were in the distance
Yeah the subs went wild with that
I just referred to it as motherfucker for a short time
I'm still baffled by how long that name is
Yesss
I'd say KitaDia too
McTeio, HeliPalmer, uhhh
Helios good
"Arrows were fired at Tracen Academy today at 9AM. They injured almost no one until Urara got hit by one of them, the absolute dumbass."
Though I suppose since the Rice Shower race was 1995, they could maybe throw in the Opera/Doto thing as a side story similar to the Rice Shower arc.
Can't imagine what other races they'd put in there.
Imo
S3 Would be Daiwa/Vodka
That sounds intriguing. Especially as someone that likes that sorta thing.
Hm... fair point.
Like, you'd have to build specific things for them
Part of me is intrigued to know about how things work in general around horse girls.
That too!
Yeeep
I can only name team Spica, most of Rigil, and a few other horses
Hope you get around to watching it. It's pretty worth it imo.
S1 is good, but it's bogged down by the fact it was essentially meant to be a mobile game ad, but now in retrospect just appears to be a safe season with a cookie cutter sports narrative only held up by its characters.
I liked S2 a lot more for the fact it was a little more serious and delved into what made Uma Musume an intriguing concept personally.
I should watch that OVA. I keep forgetting
Fun fact: Did you know that the seiyuu of El Condor Pasa is Cocona in Flip Flappers? Vodka's seiyuu was also Yayaka. So YayaCoco can happen in another entirely different anime
Yes
Lotsa good gay from 3Hz
I'd hope so
||The episode before really hit hard. Its music score does a lot more to add on.||
||Season 1 may not have a great ending, honestly it's made better with side content explaining it, but it's still one that knows how to throw gut punches||
||Ikr? It hurt me more rewatching than on my first watch. It's such a brutally sad scene.||
||Watching that episode again felt like being hit by a freight train. Easily one of the best episodes of the series.||
||PAIN||
||I'd make an Overwatch joke but now's not the time.||
||What fucks me up about YuYuYu the most is the fact that even if they try to off themselves, that doesn't work since the fairy system saves them. You're basically offering your life to these gods who eventually chip away at your bodily functions until you're just left in a vegetative state.||
||Ah. It's this scene.||
(YuYuYu S1) ||Started up my Yuuki Yuuna rewatch. Leaving off at this episode probably wasn't the worst idea, but oh my god.||
Oh, Baymax. I can never look at this character the same after finding out his VA was also Clay in Moral Orel
https://youtu.be/lcYPrMk12zw
I'm gonna probably start continuing my rewatch of season 1 since I had it paused for so long
Ooh. Exciting!
Has there been a violent fist fight in the stands yet?
Idk why but I find this mildly amusing.
Rewatching YuYuYu and I just got to one of my favorite frames.
Maybe I could do with adding Bookworm and Iruma to my PTW
I heard people call the MC Hibiki witch
Ooh yeah I heard that one was nice!
Ooh yeah I heard Iruma Kun was fun.
Bookworm... that's one I know Fenny wants me to start.
Isekai in general is either a harem power fantasy or a quirky parody, tragically.
Didn't really seem all that special to me.
I'm always surprised seeing how many people praise MT.
No thoughts, only piano
Oh
If they're ar least given a go around
I mean, I do like asshole MCs...
His design already gave me bad vibes
Lmao
Fucking what
Walmart Symphogear
Like a dude I'd bump into at hot topic or something
He loks like a generic shonen MC
When I read the synopsis I thought, "Ooh that seems interesting"
That's disappointing. But I'm not surprised.
I had to change that back to rewatching because why the hell is it doing that
Always confused why AniList decides, "Hey this person is rewatching something. Time to add it to watching!" When a rewatch is its own thing
I imagine this will be updated with season 3 once that finishes and that one miniseries made by the studio that did Umayon
Here's the best possible upload for the series I can find.
https://nyaa.si/view/1189782
Well... I do know why she's wearing the other bow but that's a spoiler
Oh no you're right!
It's one of the 10/10's anime wise for me as a YuYuYu fan, but what I'm worried about is getting my emotions torn through like a piece of paper again.
I'm both stoked and worried to rewatch WaSuYu
||Yeah! The Tougou and Yuuna ones especially.||
This ED never fails to put a smile on my face, but now to hear everyone sing...
||Yeah! A nice callback. I am finding it weird that I have screenshots throughout this rewatch yet I didn't remember that.||
||Oh yeah it was during the big fight. I guess I was just overthinking things unfortunately. I guess as a side content reader, that line appears to be a little bit of a double entendre since we know there are more Yuuna than just Yuuki.||
||Yuuna says, "I'm Sanshuu middle school's Yuuna!" Which to me, as someone who's read the side content, I find pretty interesting. As I'm not sure if Yuuna was ever told or given any details in regards to the Yuunas in Hero Club past. She didn't even know who Takashima was until she and the other Hero Club members discovered those archives talking about the first hero generation.||
Rewatching Yuuki Yuuna S1 I found an interesting quote in episode 12.
She just won a PS5, guys. She'll be back...
WaSuYu is the good kind of suffering. Easily my favorite of YuYuYu anime wise. But goddamn it hurts at times.
I'm not sure if I'm ready to suffer again...
Can't wait to wake up later and rewatch this. <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
I don't watch 86 myself but that sucks.
This line is funny since Suzuko Mimori *is* Umi in LL
||Gin... <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> ||
Here we go into a land of despair and depression again...
Kirby right back at ya was unironically the best thing 4Kids did
Aoi Yuuki best rapper of our generation
A masterpiece tbh
Eminem is quaking rn
WaSuYu is imo the best part anime wise and it's a prequel. But side material wise I really enjoy NoWaYu
YuYuYu is still pretty good in my eyes, though it's not perfect by any means.
I mean for a part of season 1 it was I'll say that much
All I've ever wanted <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Maria... Femdom...
Kana Hanazawa's performance as this character makes her pretty likable. She makes her so funny and pretty badass when a situation calls for it
Bah! Sonoko in chicken pajamas is cute!
Blursed shit
Looks like a fucking DVD screensaver
Which is like a 2/10 on her scale
A friend of mine who isn't a huge fan of Madoka, likes Symphogear and YuYuYu, rated it lower than Madoka
Molcar was cute
Did watch Molcar, Wonder Egg, and Uma S2 though
I didn't watch too many anime airing this year, so I can't comment on this much
Uma S2 is one of the best anime I've watched this year no cap
Currently trying to rewatch YuYuYu to catch up to season 3
This year for me's just been a sorta slump year. Started out watching older anime I wanted to get around to like Plastic Memories, watched Serial Experiments Lain which is easily in my top 10, rewatched Flip Flappers, and uhh...
Oddtaxi's another one I should get to watching
Orange pls
üëÄ
More Doga Kobo couldn't hurt
I should add New Game to my PTW sometime
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Rikka thighs, Akane knockers. Gridman has some good chicks.
Good stuff.
Ooh Gridman
Revue Starlight
I guess if you look into the CGDCT sphere, Doga Kobo is sure bound to have something.
Honestly no idea.
Oh yeah the fighting stuff is fun.
Yesss.
What do you like about it so far?
Yeah. Rikka and Akane are shipped.
But you forgot about Marty and Doc using the DeLorean to blow up the Death Star
Bro that was the best part
I'm going to eventually.
Gridman is really good. Will you be watching Dynazenon next?
Gridman is a lot of fun. Glad you enjoyed it!
Bro mind blown
Did it also invent busty tsunderes?!
Me after using my fists to beat the shit out of someone then make friends with them (It's a Symphogear reference)
Hype af
She's got more energy than me with watching anime atm
Imperfect Girl is such a good manga. Highly worth it for this one alone imo
https://www.humblebundle.com/books/monogatari-returns-manga-light-novels-nisioisn-from-kodansha-books
Ofc I don't really watch Jojo, but I know that the manga is pretty much far far ahead
But I guess to most people, that does kinda cut back on the hype since spoilers are a lot more of a rampant minefield to those that want to watch the series air weekly
Ehhh true
That's the biggest issue with streaming services like Netflix unloading every episode at once
^
I heard Blackfox was good, but I've yet to check it out
Though it was a co-production with 3Hz I guess, so between 3Hz and the GuP studio, which one would really make off with the series?
And Actas pretty much made off with PriPri to give it a 6 part movie series
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Yeah true
Flip Flappers and Princess Principal were fantastic series that unfortunately just fell under the radar
I hope that this is the anime to finally get Studio 3Hz to skyrocket.
AHHHHHHHHHHHH
NEW STUDIO 3HZ ANIME OP DROPPED
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49UDf5sTfMU
I'm going to wait untill around part 3 maybe idk
Yeah
Studio 3Hz is one of the best anime studios recently imo
Flip Flappers and PriPri are great recommendations though, yeah.
I need to watch the CH films but am waiting
They have Princess Principal to my surprise
3 Love Live seiyuus
Surrounded by like
Then I read the VA for Ai Ohto in Wonder Egg was also a newbie
Yeah, I was mind blown too
Ahhh.
Blue Exorcist, Blue Archive, Blue Period
Hell, Japanese media in general
Why are there so many anime with "Blue" in the title?
Flip Flappers and Lain are two of my favorite anime originals. Both are at 9/10, but both have flaws that keep them from a 10
Well worth your time tbh.
"That's a lot of M.A.O." I thought.
I remember when I rewatched Flip Flappers earlier this year and saw that string of credits
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
https://twitter.com/Anime/status/1469368075065696258?t=VU8-QGhwRFHBk6P_Glue5A&s=19
Ahh right.
A common thing in any industry
Once a concept is done very well by one thing, everything else suddenly wants to be like it
It amazes me to see 3Hz get more work.
Oh yeah I love YuYuYu S1
They started season 1
They are not watching season 3 atm
That I'm unsure of.
||The song <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>||
So none of the big character moments or anything were highlighted. Just the big scenes without the character development to make an impact.
They're more disappointed because it's, like others said, rushed.
Washio Sumi got like 3 and those were just episode adaptations
I'd sure love a NoWaYu movie
There is a number of people disappointed in Nogi Wakaba being adapted since it's the light novel everyone points to as the best YuYuYu piece
From what I hear it does adapt Nogi Wakaba is a Hero and another LN
I haven't watched it yet.
Studio Monaca also did the Nier soundtracks, so it's generally pretty good music all around.
That scene was really powerful, and the music really makes it
Yeah... episode 8 is really where I feel the series begins to pick up suffering-wise
I know Genjuro and Itachi
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I thought that was supposed to air this month lol
Wonder Egg could have been good if they didn't cock up the last half.
It's one of the few anime I did watch this year anyways
Uma Musume season 2, though
That's my favorite
Washio Sumi though

So whether or not an adaptation has it meet their end is up to them.
You could probably blame Kadokawa considering they're the publisher behind most isekai
It's mainly the light novel that does finish as the main ending
Actually true though
Sounds fun!
Made by the Yuuki Yuuna studio, it has Elfnein...
"I got reincarnated into a world where I have to stop the demon king, but me and the girls just wanna hang out instead!"
Yeaahhh
<:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034>
I heard the OP before. Absolute banger
I know a few people who like the mobile game but I hear the anime is pretty fantastic.
Not sure how many isekai actually have that sorta thing. If you were some reincarnated dude who ran into a less fortunate girl, taking them under your wing would probably be one of the more noble things.
Ahhh. Yeah, that sounds actually nice then.
Being reincarnated into a profession that cool and having the cliched harem sounds meh
Or ya know, be just about anywhere around the world
Being an assassin means getting to see some gorgeous sights
Honestly I'd just be using my abilities to start traveling around the world
I'm a little surprised they didn't blur it out when she was flying
Watching someone talk about the Halo Legends shorts rn. It's cool to look at Star Wars Visions and see that some of the same animation studios from that also did this
The only difference being horse racing is big in Japan, hockey isn't
"We probably aren't getting another season so uhhh"
That is the most shameless plug I've seen for anything

No doubt some boomers are probably still ringing that up

Just before I would screenshot my way through an anime
I need to rewatch Revue first since it's been around 2 years

Haven't seen Bandori but Chu¬≤ is cute
DanMachi 4 already huh?
Daaang
Want me to give you some good fansubs, Mel?
One of my good friends, Eileen, has watched the series of upwards 20+ times
Rewatching is easily the best part since you'll normally find things in those rewatches
I think it's totally worth it
I need to rewatch it tbh
It looks like the director of Flip Flappers is working on this now
https://myanimelist.net/anime/39763/Shishigari
"First we pan down here, then over here, then right here"
Those camera angle swaps feel a bit unnecessary
The pilot was like what? 5-ish minutes?
Remember when there was a scrapped Scott Pilgrim series meant for Adult Swim?
Post-XV
I see a lot of "Supporting" roles on her MAL character listing
Next season maybe?
Tropical Rogue Symphocure
Medium rare though
Idk. I can tell they're at least good since people I know used them to watch.
They were the ones I linked to you
The heroes, villains, everything
Nana Mizuki *is* the entire cast
It'd be equally funnier if it was Yoko Hikasa
French Fetish Fuel: the series
Saaame
Yuuki Yuuna theory: Karin is Sayaka and Kyoko's child from the future
If you're into the lore or want context for certain things in Hero Chapter, you could benefit from side material
Tbh it's fine to just watch the anime
But that's mainly because Bushiroad owns Assault LIly
Hell, Assault Lily wasn't as super successful in the west and that got a collab too
You're right.
A shame the other seasons aren't dubbed but from what I heard of it, the dub was fine
You're watching the dub?
I'd love a YuYuYu/Symphogear XDU crossover but I don't think that'll happen
Hope you enjoy.
The LN did wrap up awhile ago I hear
Huh, I forgot that DAL was still going anime-wise
Sorry for blowing this out of proportion, I just get annoyed by specific things
There are other ways to express "Hey this was posted before" than "Lol ‚ôªÔ∏è"
>Post an image that I forgot to scroll up and see was posted before since I thought it was funny
>Immediately hit with ‚ôªÔ∏è because "Haha isn't it funny people don't scroll up sometimes"
Now you can stop whining that I reposted it
Goddamn, there it's gone
Good somber story.
Washio Sumi is a flat out 10 from me btw
Yeah
No way inFamous has an anime? /j
The dub is only one season long
Sub
An AL/Love Live collab is the funniest shit
No wait I meant FuYuYu
>I haven't read FuMeYu yet <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
You know Japan has nothing to do when this is what they adapt
I can imagine they'd probably go for a "4koma" sorta thing idk
From this video specifically
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEGVGqJEeCo

"Oh, so you waited 3 months? Enjoy a recap and a vague, inconclusive shitfest."
That finale was like... *the* sting
Same
Episode 10 I did like, but you could really tell they were cramming in all the concepts they could
Then by the girls taking a trip to Neiru's office episode things really started to decline.
It had me for around the first 7 (maybe 8) episodes
A shame WEP in general wasn't great in the end
Yeah that looks dope
Also Christina Vee as Darkness
Patrick Seitz is top tier
Oh yes
That's why I don't hold Konosuba in high regard. Its humor was the basis of everything past it. And its humor isn't very good to begin with.
Yes
Fucking brilliant
The episode we ended on (we watched one more) was teaching Shogi with cats
Was watching March Comes in Like a Lion with a group on another server
He had this to say when we reach S2
He's streaming both
A friend of mine who mods an anime-related discord loves this series
We watched this so many times on DVD in the years after that the DVD wore itself out.
It blew me away and is still one of my all time favorites. From the instance I hear that "Out there...", that's it. I'm sitting down and watching. Dropping everything I'm doing and just watching.
I recall seeing this in theatres with my grandma when I was like 6 (this was 08, so I was gonna be turning 7 a few months later)
I can go on for awhile about how this is one of my favorite films of all time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nLx_7wEmwms
I can't wait for the isekai where the protag can summon a fast food place of their choosing and kill monsters by dropping a Taco Bell on top of them
I've watched the subbed and dubbed Kirby a few times and I like both, but the dub is better since I love Dedede's English voice
I love Right Back at Ya but I wish there was an "uncut" version of the dub with the Japanese clips
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oCDOF11p33w
Combat looks fun but is it worth dicking around for a day and going to do things at specific periods?
I've personally never played either but watching gameplay of Shenmue it seems like the type of game that would bore me.
It's widely accepted that Shenmue walked so Yakuza could run.
Yep
But I would have loved to see uncut JP episodes with the dub cast
I almost prefer it over the sub just for Dedede alone.
Kirby dub is easily their best imo
And it was of my favorite episode from the anime
Yo holy shit I forgot about this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U_JzkjbuQjU
I dunno really
So uhhh
There hasn't been an isekai about someone capable of dropping KFCs + parking lots and a drive through on people yet
Oh yeah Tatami is fantastic in the visuals department
I hear the OP and ED to this anime pretty often and it really really makes me wanna watch it again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I5RKYoOQCCQ
Slime is something that just immediately becomes boring I feel.
I got to around the first half with that big battle then dropped it.
Yeeeep
I do at least like the girls, but overall the series is just too hollow for me to want to enjoy it more.
^
Its humor just gets very stale, especially with how the writers tend to reuse the same comedy. Oh boy, something cool is about to happen, and they're- Oh oops! Someone did a last second thing because haha funny anime parody.
Precisely.
It's got that one weird effect where you see so many anime trying to be like it that you look at it and think, "Why did I find this funny?"
Ngl I kinda dislike Konosuba nowadays, though it's mainly for personal reasons. Though ignoring personal reasons, it's not anything too special anyway.
The Tatami Galaxy if you want a show with a good moral and are looking for something chill
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBU90ipdUxI
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1487033615473328128
So clever
God my favorite thing about Kirika's XV henshin is just that XII at the end
The OP looks like it came out in 1998
2004
I remember watching the OP to Nanoha and being surprised to hear it came out in 04
Well I'm saying that in the sense there aren't any super dramatic stakes
It's got me thinking I dodged a bullet
I do like YuYuYu but hearing how they adapted NoWaYu, which is my favorite piece of media from it, it's eh...
I haven't watched it yet and personally idk if I will
Yeah S3 came out
GREMLIN
Look at it
Not sure what the best torrent thing is but I remember using Deluge for a time. Sadly that one isn't as good as it once was.
Just use nyaa.si nbd
Yeah it is a banger
The way it visualizes Rei's depression is fantastic
Where I love OP2 from what I've heard of it, I like OP1 just for how fantastic the visuals are
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKWqPXkLgzY
But wowee are things beginning to pick up!
We stopped at episode 14 for this week
What a banger
<a:TakoJam:792028399915892757>
That new ED too

OP1 was great but I have a feeling I'll love this just a much
OP2 fucks so hard
I love how it helps to convey the mood in spots
Special mention to the soundtrack specifically
We're gonna watch that whole fucking thing
Oh yeah the groupwatch host said we will not be stopping the entirety of arc 1
All the Kawamotos are good
Since they give them voices and it adds to the humor
I love the cats too
Absolutely adore her screentime because she makes things way funnier
Momo is cute
We reached episode 11 and that's one of the screencaps
I still find it hilarious that two huuge titans (no pun intended) are trampled over by horny manga adaptation
Also Nanoha but I was thinking about 3 I watched
3 shows I can think of that all have overlap from Symphogear fans
Flip Flappers, Revue Starlight, Yuuki Yuuna
After the day I watched that first episode, I could never shut the fuck up about it.
I remember the person who introduced me to Gear owns the server for Flip Flappers and related 3Hz properties. They had told me "Oh hey if you liked Princess Principal, check out Flip Flappers"
^
This is the torrent I used
Knock yourself out
https://nyaa.si/view/1277509
It's pretty damm solid when you rewatch imo
Well worth a rewatch imo
Just a side detour continuing from <#336310266654490624> ||I think the episode with multiple Papikas was super impressive just knowing M.A.O. voiced them all||
It's finished!
A good friend of mine has been on my ass to watch it ever since we met and discovered we were both Symphogear enjoyers
I sure will!
But I think I'm ready
Started downloading Kill La Kill. Been holding off on watching for awhile due to fear of burnout
I love Titanfall 2 and I want to like Apex, but I'm honestly not the biggest BR person
Personally I've never cared about Apex
Then it could probably setup a Titanfall 3 in a way by making an entirely original story arc
If we got a Titanfall series, I wouldn't mind an adaptation of the second game's story
Its aesthetic is also just super super good
Princess Principal is definitely well worth a go if you're looking for some fun spy stuff. It's got gorgeous visuals, a fantastic soundtrack, and a gripping storyline.
The only PriPri server I am on besides 3Hz is the server for the PriPri sub, buuuuuut with how niche the show is it's probably good that there isn't an absolute minefield worth of spoiler discussion.
I think I'd do that too, but I've been pretty good about avoiding spoilers for it
Ohhh yeah
Actas will do Actas things tho
I've personally been waiting around until at least part 3 gets released and subbed
Perhaps after Kill La Kill maybe
I should rewatch it eventually because I hear the 2 Crown Handler films are pretty good
I think Flip Flappers is my favorite 3Hz production though
Good show
But yes
I had no idea you watched PriPri, Lily!
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Still a super fun show
My other favorite frame from this episode
LMAO
Ryuuko's face here is too funny
"Foolishness, Ryuko. Foolishness."
Also part of me wants to see fan art of Ira and Genjuro because they're both embodiments of manly men and that sounds so funny
Also just the way the episode ends with her putting a tennis racket on her scissor blade
I think of the 2 episodes I watched, the second was my favorite just for seeing Mako and her family
This series is pure fun and I cannot wait to watch more today
Last night based off those 2 episodes alone I've been pretty damn excited to hop back into KLK
Oh hello Vergil
Yes
Facial expressions, whacky gags like this
There are probably so many frames from this that I'll look back on and laugh about
I fucking love it
This is the most anime anime that's ever anime'd
These fucking facial expressions are killing me
Oh hey I recognize this lady from Mel's emotes
First time too
Yes
S.T.A.L.K.E.R. players shaking and crying rn
The look on her face lol
Ah yes, the pogchamp girl from Twitter
Ahhh, that's fair
I'd love to tackle Automata but I should prob play Replicant first since that's a remake of the original
Yeah I'm in the boat of people who've yet to play it but from what I've seen it looks great
^
Yeah I've no idea why
Oh boy, people horny over android ass redux
Np
And it's pretty evident that this episode was one of those examples
A friend said they use the low budget to their advantage
Yeah
Void Chords absolutely kills it
YESSSSSSSSSSSS
Smh
Nonon's theme is so hype
No context KLK best KLK
"Don't worry. I won't have you lashed to a cross like the rest of these degenerates."
Capitalize on escapist fantasy shit
We could have had more cool original stuff but nah
The manga adaptation started on the same day as the anime
Oh yeah apparently KLK was also under Kadokawa
/j
If KLK really saved anime why are we stuck in an isekai purgatory then?
Is this a literal nailgun?
Mako is just moeblob incarnate, Ryuuko is a hotheaded tsundere, Satsuki is the stoic antagonist
My fav thing about Kill La Kill is the fact each character is the embodiment of a certain trope in a good way
AniList
I would probably say Kill La Kill if you like hype stuff but I'm only 4 episodes in so no real verdict I can give
If you like Symphogear, you'll enjoy:

Yuuki Yuuna is a Hero
Madoka Magicka
Uhhh...
Gave it a 10 but idk might re-evaluate
Not sure where Houseki is gonna stand nowadays but I did really like it watching it awhile ago
What's your favorite anime list? Here's mine
I'm gonna start Vivy eventually
Flip Flappers too
Gonna watch episode 7 later today but 6 was fun
These smears never get old
Dopest shit
Oh hey I heard this chick's like Fin√©
Said with extreme charisma
She's in your walls
D-tecnolife is great too
Asterisk is a classic, can't blame you
So hype
My fav Bleach OP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2edBgIH7y68
It's been out less than SpongeBob or other animated series and it's gotten 20 seasons?
The first season was in 04/05? Wtf?
But yeah I plan on watching Utena eventually
This is a little longer
Kill La Kill first because that's like 24 episodes
<@!250295696714891285> Getting this stuck in my head again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HL25C0H9vVw
And recall watching like the first 3 or 4 episodes years ago
TTGL is an anime where I know exactly what happens but regardless I'd watch it just because I wanna see more cool mecha stuff
Yep
And Gurren Lagann since that's a show I do sorta know a bit about but haven't really watched it to the end
It makes me def want to go and watch Panty and Stocking eventually
And I tend to really pay close attention if a show has something it wants to say
But the difference being that KLK also has messages in its theming
This is the first time since Symphogear where I've been hyped to watch anime again
I adore it already so I'm hyped
Oh yeah I've heard
Super stoked to be making my way through the series
Gonna watch episode 8 later today
~~Well tbh Symphogear S1 is good don't @ me~~
Wtf
This episode was a nice look at how wealth and status really bolster ego. Sometimes a life of luxury is better off not being lived. Just be humble.
Social commentary for me to overanalyze? This really is my kinda show!

üëÄ
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Wtf are those eyes
It's like the SpongeBob thing with Patrick having the jug of water on his head
First rule:
Just wait til she finds out about social media
Yooo they made the UK into a character?
Half of my screenshots are probably going to be smears.
These smears get me every time
Unlimited Tax Evasion Works
Shoutout to this for probably being one of the oldest anime OP on YouTube
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-anabfAg06U
She's part of the charm of KLK imo
Holy FUCK that sound design
My favorite scene overall of the 7 episodes I've seen so far has to be that first big Ryuuko/Satsuki face off in episode 3
Gags like that always get me laughing
My favorite gag was when she was talking about her family peeping on her talking to Senketsu and she just made like multiple clones
Her gags with praising Ryoko are great
I love Mako so much
I think it's set to be my next 10/10
Thank you!!!
Hearing about mecha the size of several galaxies is too cool tbh
~~Get my mind out of the gutter, get it out of there~~
It's one of those things that ends up aiding the series in retrospect.
Oh yeah, I think YuYuYu is worth watching just for Washio Sumi alone
Yuuki Yuuna just scares people off because they hear it's either a Madoka clone or that the ending to S1 sucks. It's a pretty solid time to me solely for how it approaches the genre. Sure, the CGI can look clunky and the aforementioned ending can scare people away, but that's no real excuse to not at least give it a shot. YuYuYu isn't going to be for everyone and that's fine. Symphogear isn't for everyone, yet it's something we all enjoy despite its issues.
||You also learn about how they have their functions back later, and it's not particularly pretty.||
||I also think that S1's copout ending wears off honestly, considering that Washio Sumi is a Hero afterward is such a huge emotional hit that I don't find myself as effected by "We suddenly have our bodily functions back"||
The amount of people who compare it to Madoka I feel are just saying that based off them both being dark magical girl shows. Personally what makes me enjoy YuYuYu as a series is the way it builds its world. I like how worldbuilding generally expands with each series entry, but I think its biggest burden is that some seasons require side content to understand it.
But I still find its approach to the genre to be pretty interesting.
Sure, S1's ending was a copout to be sure
Personally I like YuYuYu
Ehhh.... I can't really agree on this?
Neussy üò≥
So dope
Love the black and white for the first part
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
I know that doing something out of spite sounds a little out of character for me but ya know
I also recall Konosuba being one of my more drastic changes, since I had both seasons at an 8. But given how my tastes changed and how I did have a bit of a rocky past with the community around the series, I just sorta attach lower scores to them out of spite. Out of knowing my tastes have changed.
Yeah
Hell, the scores I made for Symphogear and others did change when I saw people's points, but they're still mostly 8/10s in my book
Yeah this has helped to make me feel a little better about scoring
Truuue
I think that's what makes AniList good, mainly because if you wanna use a number system, it's there. But there's also stars and smileys to indicate what you thought of a series
Yep.
I'm about the same
True
Madoka is good but I felt that the later episodes were a lot better pacing wise. Though I understand why earlier episodes just took it slow.
Oh yeah that's exactly why I rated them at 9 and 10
I haven't watched PriPri in years but vaguely remember liking it
Hey, if Flip Flappers got rewatched a year ago and is still a 9/10 to me, that sure as hell says something.
Hm... that's right.
You would think I'm an IGN critic with how many 10s I've given
Madoka I've given a 9/10 and Rebellion a 10. I think Madoka in general is due for at least another glance since I have it saved on my laptop HDD
Honestly I should eventually give Madoka a rewatch thinking about it. I did give YuYuYu a rewatch last year and rated it down to a 7/10. Though I personally like the first season, it's hard to deny its flaws.
And it's only wherever it left off
>You get an announcement for New Game
>New Game!! Episode 1
Haven't watched that one yet but I liked Doga Kobo for Plastic Memories and Engaged to the Unidentified

And I noticed one of them was literally MechWarrior 3
The one thing I do remember about DAL was like one specific clip someone took of the dub where this chick was destroying arcade games
Suppose that's because it's the Neptunia character artist
Haven't bothered with DAL at all and don't think I will. But at least the girls look cute.
But I'm excited since Studio 3Hz won me over with Flip Flappers and Princess Principal
Tbf it is based off an actual idol group
Looking forward to Healer Girl the most because Studio 3Hz
~~I'm always looking for people to recommend that show to~~
Didn't you see Flip Flappers too?
She's already seen that
If you liked Gridman, you'll like Gurren Lagann
But I mean
That's an easy mecha recommendation for sure
If you like mecha, maybe TTGL?
Eizouken will also for the fact it's a super fun and creative series
This is why shows like Flip Flappers stick around in my head years after I watched them
Yuasa
Yep
They also made Tatami Galaxy, which is one of my favorite anime ever
Eizouken is from a director who's known for their unusual art style
An absolutely fun series
The OP will undoubtedly get stuck in your head too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8-91y7BJ8QA
Eizouken is great yeah
~~If she wanted something about the anime industry I'd also recommend Eizouken~~
Well tbf I don't watch too too much
But I do like it
I'm not sure if I'd recommend KLK to you given its more adult themes
https://anilist.co/user/DasAntihero/
Anilist is better from my experience
With a tone like that from the first paragraph you think this would be a little serious
Idoly Pride's description sounds a little misleading tbh
Or is that another "Not old enough" sorta thing?
Princess Principal maybe too?
I love it
This OP still bangs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaTzRcSyEWc
Brilliant anime imo
If you want my favorite CGDCT ever just look at Sora Yori
Let me go first let me go first!
Is it Konosuba pissing hours again?
Princess Connect I hear is fine, but the second season is airing rn and I hear nothing but praise
It's nuts
What makes Umamusume great is that they're based off real horses, and a lot of the moments you see in the anime are based off the real races
Can highly recommend Uma Musume
Idk who the 3rd girl is
Dog Days has Serena, Tsubasa, and Maria in it
And all the PTW stuff is just what I plan on getting to
So when the episode was over, there'd be a peaceful ending theme
Fun fact: The OP was made on purpose to be loud since the anime aired at 1AM JST
Paranoia Agent is absolutely solid
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QEsNDDwhSJ4
Lain's one of my favorites but Paranoia Agent is also good too
Join Lain gang
I can always get you interested in psychological horror.
If I already have Revue at a 10, no doubt this'll be another
I hear nothing but good thing about Wild Screen Baroque tbh
Because goddamn does Revue have so many good screenshot worthy moments
Sad I only started taking screenshots when watching anime with YuYuYu
It's been like 2 years since I first watched Revue
I need to watch Rondo beforehand tho
Saaame
Episode 8 was super hype but I might watch more tomorrow
Vergil moment
Daaaayum, now that's a ride.
If Mako and Miku had a contest for how gay they were for their girlfriend, who would win?
I love how Nonon and the other Devas don't have to worry about people fighting and just casually walk by
Ryuuko's face is a mood
This was my favorite pic from last night
They're naked because this is an alternate timeline where the humans are running the Krusty Krab and they're Mr. Krabs trying to steal the secret formula
Uma Musume S2 was freaking good
I'm shocked not even Uma Musume
Feel bad for WEP. Despite not liking the later episodes, the soundtrack was phenomenal.
Awww, looks like I arrived an hour early.
MediEvil anime
No way
She's so cocky I love her
Been looking forward to seeing her fight since episode 5 tbh
Hibiki episode?
January 2021 GameStop stock inflation (colorized)
"Most hospital visits for a director"
De de Mouse deserves more love for their WEP contributions
I absolutely loved the soundtrack
~~Anime of the Year goes to The Last of Us Part 2~~
Ofc I haven't heard it dubbed yet since I plan on rewatching it dubbed later buuuut I do hear good things about KLK dubbed
It really fits her character's smug tone.
Yeah I love her sub voice
Amazing.
I love her

Or they pull an Endless Eight with someone breaking the loop
Then they said they wanted to do it all again
When Fry and Leela grew old together
Yeah

Twice?
How many times has Futurama died and returned by this point?
"SJW" and "Woke" I'm referring to ofc
Seeing either of those phrases sets off alarm bells in my head
Saaaame
Ehhh, you do you ig
Huh.
Damn, it's 2022 and people are still using "SJW" as a term?
Perhaps I should move to <#407060923078017026>
It's the lady again!
Even includes royal release too!
She learned royal guard <:Stuff:905926629656756225>
/j
Ah yes, the Judge Judy theme!
~~Get my mind outta the gutter~~
Oh hey it's the girl my friend really likes
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
God this episode was just
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AK3PWHxoT_E
With Futurama coming back I gotta shout out this episode
That is pretty based tho
Used to catch reruns of it when it was on Comedy Central
I forget if there's a dad episode. The announcement of a revival sure does sound like the time for me to sit down and actually watch it again
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Allow me to gush about Flip Flappers because fuck it, why not?:

Flip Flappers is easily one of the most creative anime I've seen. Each episode, character, and theme within it ooze with charm and substance. Everything from its characters, its visuals, and its story are fantastic. Where I have other anime I enjoy from years past, I don't think I've quite seen anything quite like it. Wonder Egg could have filled that void easily, but its later episodes were too overfilled that you knew it wouldn't have a conclusion. This series is without a doubt one of the best 9/10s I've ever given an anime, and rewatches remind me that it could've been a 10 if the ending didn't feel super rushed. As subjective as number scores are, I think Flip Flappers is still well worth your time if you adore anime and are looking for something that oozes with charm and finesse.
I think Nonon may just be my favorite out of the four just for how unique her character is. Hearing she was gonna be a by-the-books punk rocker with a guitar that makes shockwaves would've made her a lot less memorable than her final design. An evil drum major? Hell yeah!
My favorite arc is probably the First Naturals Election just because it was cool seeing the Four Devas against Ryuuko. My personal favorite being Nonon's battle.
Trigger is gonna use low budget animation to its advantage because it's Trigger damnit
Episode 4 is my favorite example of this.
You can tell with some episodes and being given 2 cours to complete it, they wanted to use the budget in the most efficient way possible. So you're bound to see some animation that's fairly limited, but it manages to work gracefully because it's used so well.
One of the aspects of Kill La Kill I've been enjoying so far is how they utilize the animation throughout
From the groupwatch guy pinging our group specifically:
My biggest downfall with anime is that if I'm not screenshotting it, I won't remember it as well.
I am gonna eventually rewatch S1 and S2 just to get screenshots.

I absolutely adore the series so far. OP2 and the second cour in general marks such a delightful turning point as Rei is shown becoming a lot more open. Even accepting the Kawamotos as his new "family"
Finishing S1 of 3gatsu with that groupwatch atm. We're on episode 19
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

It's a crayola marker
She's got freaking barcodes for eyes!
Jesus christ the image Mel posted
Just when I got that cursed image out of my head
It just conveys scenes so damn well
The 3gatsu OST is one of my favorite aspects
Shatter my spirit, Studio Shaft
I'm super excited to hop into it
Oh yeah I hear
I think my favorite 3gatsu scene was no doubt the Nyan Shogi stuff
Ohhhh yeah him!
My biggest weakness when watching through anime is that I *need* to take screenshots throughout, otherwise I'll forget it
But when we finish 3gatsu I should really download the version they're using so I can screenshot my way through
Groupwatch is gonna be doing S2 episodes 1 - 10 (or 11/12 idk) this Saturday
Ohhh yeah he did I think
Shimada is S2 right?
I knew that
Yep
I had no idea
What the fuck
Reminder that Momo Kawamoto is the cutest thing in existence
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lRMSzgbueh8
But even then that doesn't excuse them from not having those apps. Not everyone has a smart TV.
Ik Netflix isn't on the Switch. I imagine that Nintendo's just been a lot more restrictive with media apps because they want people to use them as gaming machines first and foremost?
Does Nintendo not trust media apps like Netflix or Hulu the way they did with Wii/Wii U?
Wonder why it took so long tbh
I'm a little surprised that Netflix hasn't made its way to the Switch but Crunchyroll has
It is already on PS4 and Xbox
Chat looking like the beginning of a Call of Duty level
Burning my house down with this fire rn
I haven't really used MAL but I find AL far better
Good site tbh
Check it out, Sam
https://anilist.co/user/DasAntihero/
You tell me.
She's Momo Kawamoto, the incarnation of moe
CREECHER IN HIGH VISUAL QUALITY
Only Shaft can put so much detail into a man just eating cake with his hands.
Hell, I might even get into the manga if I can find the time.
So I'll eventually rewatch it to get into it more. S1 was so fun.
Just figured since it was a groupwatch that I could get it off my PTW, but it's been such a treat.
When we finish I might just torrent it myself and give it a watch 'cuz I happen to have a better time watching things on my own.
3gatsu's been great.
So so excited to finally be watching this.
I hope we don't.
The person who's gonna stream the first few arc said "Oh yeah we can stop whenever you like" since it'd be a 4 hour stream if we sat through that first arc.
3gatsu S2 groupwatch today <:KirikaPog:605209108827734017>
Speaking of Funimation, with how they are 2 companies under the same roof, does this mean some of their libraries will bleed into one another?
Of course I can have my opinion on which one I like better, but if there's the option for it, I shouldn't judge.
Honestly I'm in the boat of letting people enjoy anime if it's subbed or dubbed regardless.
Then their only reason for it is "B-but da writer is feminist!!"
That's just how good 3gatsu is. I *really* want more, even if we're already watching through.
Maybe I can just start the manga... Hm...
Downloading S1 would be good so I could start building a screenshot bank, but I would need to finish KLK first.
Part of me wants to just download the seasons now and watch ahead but I wanna wait for next Saturday since we bumped up 4 episodes to 6
Episode 4 is probably up there as one of my fav anime episodes now.
I freaking loved that ending
We stopped at episode 6. What I love about season 2 so far is the focus on not just Rei, but the Kawamotos too.
3Gatsu S2 is so good
Looks like episode 6 is our deadline for this weekend's groupwatch. But holy fuck
3gatsu really picking up rn. Season 2 I think I'm gonna freaking love.
Grandpa's a real one <a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
Holy. Shit.
Holy shit.
Aww. Hina's sad. I think this is the start of that arc everyone's talking about?
You get no context
God, and I thought I had huge shoes. This man's probably a size 12 or 13
I haven't really watched Shippuden in years but I rewatched part 1 2 years ago, skipping the filler as I went along
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a5l2OF1byrE
OP15 is also up there as one of my favs
<:MahiruOfCulture:633518942098423808>
Yep!
Everything here is just too good
This is my favorite overall Naruto OP probably
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XNGLHlNndkI
And the Sand village trio is there
The only real changes to note are Orochimaru being all bandaged up and Rock Lee and Might Guy practicing at the end
V2 for those curious
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TMt4DeonnC4
Oh yeah the song is an absolute banger
I like how this OP also changes at a point
Sasuke Retrieval Arc was my fav aspect of Part 1
God, I just remembered how much I loved this OP
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lilv4MvBY6E
And the synopsis def helps with furthering me wanting to give it a watch. The idea of "Two lovers with similar passions" is great.
Watching the OP to Sono Bisque Doll it does look pretty cute
I hear DBZ does that a lot
Wasn't DBZ Kai just a retelling of the series again?
Funny enough I remember watching DBZ on Nicktoons when Kai was airing
True
Only difference being I still hold some form of respect for Naruto. Whether I like it or not, it was one of my first genuine anime obsession.
Naruto has that same effect that I had looking at Konosuba in retrospect. Both have major tropes within each of their respective genres that bite them in the ass.
Yeah, that's my other big reason
It's a good series, and I have no doubt in my mind MHA probably is too, but I think because of how much time I invested in Naruto I don't want to invest in another
I think Naruto is kind of the reason I can't get invested in other big shonen like MHA
V3 <:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>
Asian Kung Fu Generation just works like that
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VMkg2F4QfIA
I've a soft spot for Blood Circulator
Silhouette was an instant classic the first it aired
https://youtu.be/RKVWLnVqnP0
This series prints money at this point
No resistance to that tbh
That twist was nuts
Yep.
Now I think my biggest goal is to rewatch Revue Starlight so I can go into the movie with a fresh mind.
I clogged <#407060923078017026> for long enough, just wanted to give an "Oh hey yeah, I finished it" to those who don't bother looking.
I've gotta watch that bonus episode, but I'll do it tomorrow. It's a 10/10 to me solely for how it manages to embody various anime tropes in an extremely over-the-top and creative fashion. Where there were a few uncomfortable scenes later on in the series, I saw things turn around pretty well and honestly that's why I gave it a 10.
Just finished Kill La Kill.
What I've seen of D4DJ it looks pretty awesome for a CGI show
Reminds me of the string of jokes my friend made with KLK and Nui getting her arms cut off
<:Wheezing:767176905987326003>
Yes
Hearing him shout 'YOU FUCKER!" while I was just chilling watching Gridman was goofy
His girlfriend detailed his experience with seeing Mami die
I've been meaning to get my brother to watch Sora Yori since ol' Devin likes SoL stuff
So I think I might take a small break before jumping back into Revue again
I just finished Kill La Kill yesterday save for the last OVA episode
I should honestly give that a watch again
God, I still love looking through my screenshot folder back at anime like Sora Yori
And I don't think a recap would be suited for watching maybe idk
And little old me has anime dementia‚Ñ¢Ô∏è so I tend to forget things if I don't screenshot my way through the original
Because when I first watched Revue in 2020, this was during that age where I didn't screenshot
I think part of it comes down to me wanting to get screenshots
I've heard so many good things about the movie
Planning on rewatching it with RippleSubs then watching the movie
~~I blame Tool's music videos for that~~
I just like over-the-top surreal stuff that hides a meaning
Same
If I enjoyed Revue, I think I'll greatly enjoy Penguindrum and Utena
I generally enjoy shows that tackle darker subject matters in a surrealist way. Which is why I adore Lain.
If I've watched stuff like Paranoia Agent, Lain, and WEP I think I'm able to handle this I think
Oh yeah I've heard. People say Utena is a lot darker than what the OP makes you think you're in for.
Saw the OP of it and really liked what I saw
I had that on my AniList PTW at one point and was meaning to give it a go
Oh hey, Penguindrum
^ Isn't one of his better films Good Will Hunting?
He's better as a director from what I hear
Yeah
There is the fact his acting isn't the best and what Millhi said.
Not too many people like Ben Affleck as an actor. My mom in particular dislikes him I know that.
I think the Golden Raspberrys can be funny, particularly for the Bruce Willis stuff
I need my fill of rocks suffering
Season 2 when Orange
I was gonna mention LotL but D4DJ came up first
I think I might watch this again dubbed
I love her so much
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=evCW6Fp-NIQ
How many years after Symphogear is this?
She sounds like fun!
And Adam in AXZ
He was Mikisugi in KLK tho
No wait different seiyuu
Viral sword
Ah yes
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1497121292557774850?s=20&t=jMnCH35dgFdqMV5gGbLYuA
And people prefer watching the show in the lowest quality possible to fit with the aesthetic
Lain VHSes are pretty rare but well sought after for collector reasons
We did have DVDs but not too many
I remember growing up in a family that was just barely living by the middle class line so I fondly remember VHSes well.
Oh yeah, then I should totally give it a go
Hell, my friend who loves KLK said that guitar Ryuuko had was probably a reference to it
That's another one I should watch
Initially I was gonna watch Cowboy Bebop but my friends suggested I watch something chill
Gonna be watching Nichijou, but I might wait a bit given I just finished KLK
"Crypto Bros hate him! Find out how he remembers most of what he's watched in one simple trick!"
So who knows? Maybe I'll give y'all the treatment I gave <#407060923078017026> for Kill La KIll and share my screenshotting with 3Gatsu whenever I'm arsed to rewatch it for sake of screenshotting
I am really enjoying March Comes in Like a Lion but I don't wanna abandon the groupwatch going through season 2 just to watch it on my own.
Idk what it is about me and not really comprehending anime unless I screenshot through it
I wonder if VTuber anime is gonna be the hip new thing. We got that cameo in that one anime awhile ago
https://twitter.com/KizunaAIinc/status/1497535029181698048
Ahhh. Thanks!
Downloaded Nichijou last night. Looks like my torrent came with some "Episode 0"
AMAZING
We could only do 4 episodes this week, but I hear next week will be good
The creecher
Damn, 3Gatsu S2 episode 9 I was not expecting Rei of all people to say "Go fuck yourself."
Wasn't I just saying something like this might happen?
But I find it odd it's not there in the US one. Or it is, but I haven't dicked around the app enough
Apparently D+ Europe has the foreign dubs of it
Tragic that you can't watch Ratatouille in French on Disney+
Even crappy services like Crunchyroll had their origin as an anime piracy site
And media in general
The 90s/00s was a wild west era of the internet really
Or KQEH now
KTEH
Yeah.
Some PBS station aired it and Evangelion
By "Super mainstream" I of course mean it wasn't as popular as it was. You did have Toonami and stuff, but even then that was kid/teen stuff edited down for a kids channel. Though I did read Lain aired a few times in the States
Ahhh yeah. Anime wasn't super mainstream in the States anyways, so it'd make sense if it were just dubs.
If it even exists.
If the dubbed version is rare this much, I wwonder how much the subbed goes for.
Hopefully Ratatouille gets put in the National Film Registry someday. Wall-E got chosen for selection last year.
My favorite Pixar movie is Wall-E
It's a good freaking movie at least, so I didn't mind
Conner kept me up last night 'cuz he was watching Ratatouille on the TV in our room.
I've seen the gun one because it's memed on so I can't imagine the others
üëÄ
I'd be down to try 5 one of these days
Oh yeah I'm sure the games themselves are great
There's certain game series like Kingdom Hearts and Persona I flat out avoid because of my "friends" from my past liking them.
I know how that feels
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
I'm already someone who is critical of Symphogear despite loving it, so I can't imagine how RWBY fans feel with how the writing of their ongoing series is since I hear plenty of negative things about later volumes.
Oh yeah I hear plenty of division regarding RWBY. Especially later volumes.
The choreography and the scythe also being a shotgun is the coolest shit
I've never seen RWBY and I don't think I'll ever dive into it, but that first trailer is still something I enjoy watching time and time again
They're probably hugely jealous of Microsoft so they're busy trying to buy other mediums to put their hands on
Yep
Hearing of a multitude of services under one umbrella being merged sucks
My one issue here is how it's corporate monopolization
I do miss those days
Sony do be monopolizing on western anime streaming
It was so horrible that the few screenshots I took from it I immediately deleted after.
I still have memories watching that special.
Yep
When people were "hyped' for the special WEPisode everyone said "OH GET IT FROM WAKANIM IT'S UP THERE OOH OOH OOH"
I remember people mentioning it before on Wonder Egg server. Apparently it's some French app
Honestly the first 3 movies are a little nostalgic to me but I think the first and second ones are pretty much the best. Also I can't stop laughing every time I hear Sid because I think of Globox, as Sid's voice actor was Globox in Rayman 3
My little brother's been watching the Ice Age movies since Disney+ has them
S2 might be another 10/10 for me personally. It's just that good.
But it's such a good anime that I think it's worth a rewatch just for screenshots
This groupwatch is great, and I admittedly at first wanted to do it just to get it off my PTW
I can't wait to eventually rewatch this but screenshot my way through it
||Chiho I did not expect to return||
üë¥
Its sequel is gonna be 20 in 2 years
Shrek's a classic
What an episode
Teacher is a gigachad too
I'm so glad to see the Kawamoto girls get more focus
We're apparently gonna be watching to episode 14 today and we're on 12 rn
3Gatsu S2 episode 12 ||"She never returned to school after that." gave me chills. Damn, this episode starts off super ballsy.||
Well, you can't really wear a DVD out per se. But it did get scratched up enough 'cuz I loved watching it to the point we couldn't anymore
For me, that movie is Wall-E. I have the fondest memory of seeing it with grandma at age 6. Then when we got the DVD, I about watched it til the disc wore out. I love that movie.
Talking as a kid, but I guess we can toss in anime too
Has there ever been an animated movie that's stuck with you since you've first watched it that you've grown to love?
Like, sometimes just pure uncanny
From what I've seen of Akebi it looks so unusual
Ohhhh
What's Seabook?
I should watch P&S soon
Which sure, makes sense
I've read the TVTropes page to that one
Since they are originals
Isn't Trigger about making anime that have actual endings or something?
I liked Gridman's ending and am excited to go into Dynazenon, but I heard what you said about it before
Episode 12 was kino
Looks like we stopped at episode 13 not 14
Chris is a supporting character in the new 3Hz anime
*Insert obligatory GX boxset comment*
Well, 25.
Normally I don't really do long anime, but I guess it's better than burning myself out with 13 episodes
Surprises me how I go from Kill La Kill 2 weeks ago to a 26 episode comedy anime
Anyway, I think I might head off to bed. But tomorrow I'll definitely be watching the first few episodes.
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
Seeing a girl with a minigun for an arm had me mildly amused, so I'm really looking forward to the comedy the most
Oohhhhhh
üëÄ
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Girls going to Antarctica and we swear you won't cry, we swear
But I've been amped to watch Nichijou because I've seen the OP and heard all about how much of a classic it is
Sora Yori probably isn't really SoL
That's about it
The only other SoL things I've watched are Sora Yori, Engaged to the Unidentified (which was ok, nothing super special but it was cute) and uhhh
Ohh yeah I've been looking forward to it for awhile.
Ahhh. Thanks a plenty for helping me get a little more excited. Since it's like 12:17AM here I should really be heading to bed, but I look forward to starting Sono Bisque and Nichijou tomorrow, that's for sure
But with anime I'm always so weirdly focused on one thing at a time
With games? Sure, I can play 3 Rayman games at once and Bioshock on top of it because I'm ADHD as hell
Not at that anime watching phase where I can be watching so many shows at once a week lol
But I might just try and do a balancing act of watching both
Me and juggling anime is a rare trait
Initially I was gonna start Nichijou this week, but I might try to binge what episodes of Sono Bisque are out already.
Well alright, that sells me.
Oh yeah I've seen some GIFs of it already
Ofc we don't necessarily see eye-to-eye on YuYuYu but I still respect your opinions regardless
I know you normally write and critique anime with some pretty top tier tastes liking Revue and such
I'm even more amped to start if you're saying it's good
I've been sorta looking forward to it since I hear it's really good.
Of course I'm gonna have to watch tomorrow
I just think it's a breath of fresh air since Marin from what I hear is a character whose relationship with the MC is less "teasing" and more about their hobbies meeting in a sense
Honestly have been looking a little forward to this. It's good to have a character that diverts from the "Teasing their senpai" thing we saw with Uzaki and Nagatoro
Was incentivized by a friend to start watching Sono Bisque Doll
New Game but people are being overworked and the girls are forced to watch snuff to make deaths look realistic or something idk
But I'm super excited
<:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>
Anyways, I look forward to sharing with y'all my thoughts on Nichijou tomororw.
Given I love watching behind the scenes things for games and movies, I'll no doubt love that
So if Eizouken was the "Anime creation and creativity process" side of things, Shirobako is a little more "realistic" in regards to that?
So maybe I could check out Paprika soon
Perfect Blue is also on there 'cuz Paranoia Agent blew me away and I wanted to dive into more of Satoshi Kon's works
I like nice, even numbers
I'm the type of person who just has a list that is cut to a certain point
Shirobako and GGG are *totally* not on there 'cuz of Mel's influence I swear
I definitely have a lot planned though
Glad I dodged a bullet since I saw "0" and thought "Oh hey maybe that's a prologue one"
So it'd be like a 6 or 7/10?
My torrent for Nichijou came with episode 0 but I've heard mixed things. I remember someone telling me to watch it after the series
Lol
Ohhh
Unless there's one I'm missing
Downloaded the first Dress Up Darling episode and will crack into that in a bit.
That's a weird mobile glitch
Wtf
According to the article, their most notable voice role was in Code Geass
üôè

Yeesh, and I thought isekai titles were long
I cannot wait to watch more tomorrow
Gorgeous
Me when I experience a mild inconvenience in the midst of a conversation
Marin looks so pretty aaaaaa
Her...
Here we go
<@!155340660738621440>
Yooo anime girl with blahaj
<:CarolWhat:688191203040034831>
Wtf
Wasn't there also him tracing commissions and stuff?
Yeah lmao
It's always funny to remember those creators that stroked their own ego so hard that they try ludicrous shit like that
Idk why, but I just randomly remembered
I just remembered that time Butch Hartman tried to start a streaming service
https://www.crunchyroll.com/anime-news/2022/03/08-1/toei-animations-website-gets-hacked-studio-shuts-down-online-shop
Ahhh. That's fair.
I guess the one issue is not everyone has access or can see that channel so I figured I'd post here.
Given this is a fanservicey show too
Ahhh right
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Lmao
Her obsessing over this anime within an anime
I've a feeling this is going to be a super funny gag
Lmaoooooooooooo
Unfortunately
Anything can be a part of the metaverse nowadays <:HibikiTsun:738234664656961556>
That ending with the clapping in the void gave me chills
That was some peak voice acting
<:CoconaHyperWhew:667176107514134558>
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Kadokawa on their way to oversaturate LNs and anime with isekai garbage
Never watched it
Oh hey I remember hearing about that being on Adult Swim
I like how this has become a meme here lmao
But can he beat SpongeBo-
Lmao
A cool, short fan animation

What y'all have been waiting for!
From what I hear AXZ and XV don't have BD releases in Japan yet, so who knows how long this will really take?
It's weird to see this many sequels
I've heard "Shit" in T rated games before
It *is* a TV-14

AmaLee sounds fantastic as Marin tbh

Watching a clip of the Dress Up Darling dub
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
It says, in very tiny print

CV: Gordon Freeman
Hold on, I can read kanji
Aww rip, no 3gatsu Saturday this week
Sure thing!
Time to binge tonight ig.
But I'm all for actually watching it
That's bonkers!
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
Hopefully I can binge the rest tonight
Only saw the first 3 episodes so now I'm thinking they're actually leaning into making things super fanservicey
I watch anime on my phone with headphones in anyway, so I'm probably not super in danger
Yeesh, that's a warning for Dress Up Darling for sure
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Oh right, I remember that being teased.
What is wrong with that guy's fingers
~~They didn't choose a good star system~~
When Symphogear GX beats you, you know you've done bad
Episodes 1 - 7 I was onboard
Episode 8 (recap) eh, it's fine. I don't mind a mid-season recap too much, but I understand their troubles
Episode 9 was ass
Episode 10 was my favorite
Episode 11 I kinda went "Ok where are they going with this?"
Episode 12 I was running out of hope
Episode 13 (special) was the most disappointing thing I'd watched that year.
That's my explanation as to why I haven't been as on top of Dress Up Darling as I was. I just remember being so disappointed by WEP towards the end, then that long wait for a godawful special that I just... stopped watching things as they aired I guess.
And considering how that ended, it really burnt me out.
Ngl I never really watched anime weekly. The one time I did in the 3 years I've been watching anime as a side hobby is Wonder Egg.
So close to the end
S2 episode 16
If it was, the host and I would be the only two there.
The ending has the titans dancing to a modern pop song like it's a kids movie
Once I finish Dress Up Darling, I think I'm gonna finally watch Nichijou
Cloverworks stuff looks to be bangers. I know a few people on another server really like Spy x Family
'Cuz Studio 3Hz
Only thing next season I'm gonna watch is Healer Girl
No, season 3. Translating the highlights into a few anime episodes isn't an adaptation of NoWaYu <:woWonayiM:833581261925908510>
i.e. Nogi Wakaba is a great light novel, but I shouldn't need to read up on side content to get an understanding of certain things in-universe. Even if NoWaYu treats itself as a prequel.
So we'd be here all day if I went over a few of my issues with the franchise.
I think YuYuYu could be better in some spots, but then again I like to critique Symphogear
There are certainly comparisons to be drawn, i.e. Tougou being akin to Homura because dark haired magical girl who's suffered the most is a trope by this point
Is YuYuYu flawed? Certainly. Is Madoka flawed? Yes. Do I enjoy both? Well, yeah.
In general I like both series, so I refuse to give into the "Will compare x to y" case with either.
Yep
I think YuYuYu is a series I do enjoy, even though I can acknowledge the criticism towards it. I like Madoka, I like YuYuYu. But I can't put a finger as to why people enjoy comparing it. Sure, there *are* a few similarities, but a show being mahou shoujo with dark themes shouldn't equal Madoka tbh.
That i just stopped watching anime entirely
When I rewatched S1 in 2021 I did enjoy it, but I was so out of steam because burnout is a bastard
Been meaning to watch YuYuYu's third season given I loved it watching it in 2020
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
I've been meaning to watch Dress Up Darling but every night I find myself distracted by other things üòî
WEP was almost that
üòî
Wish we'd get an original as banging as Flip Flappers
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Specifically the episode where King Dedede hires animators to remake the first episode of the Kirby anime with him as the hero
I saw the name of that anime/manga and thought of that Kirby anime
~~I'm waiting for the idol anime where the girls have panic attacks before shows and show the seedier side of being a musical idol~~
I almost forgot YuYuYu started off original then had LNs/mangas that followed
Yeah
Yeah. Some days my fav anime is Symphogear, others it's Flip Flappers. Sometimes my favorite game is Sonic Adventure 2. The next it's Skies of Arcadia.
I've got 2 more days til episode 12 airs. So it's time to pick up the pace!
I just finished episode 5. Hopefully tomorrow there's less distractions. Munch walking into the room and demanding he be scratched sure derailed things.
I know someone who has the same opinion
I've heard people say that the ending is especially awful.
That's reassuring
Is it bad I've avoided watching DITF specifically due to the overhype of this character and the series overall?
I'm always super indecisive on what my favorite game or soundtrack is lol
Me_irl
Her smile is precious
Catching up on Dress Up Darling and aaaaaaaaa
https://t.co/52fsg9YMrY
Of course I can imagine an anime adaptation you'd have to make everything generic as to reel unsuspecting people in for the other aspects of the property like the mobile game.
Then there's stage plays.
Assault Lily afaik is a line of dolls with stories to them. Think Bionicle but for Japan.
The groupwatch I've been doing for it is so close to the end of S2 and I'm super excited for the rest.
3Gatsu is excellent.
Yep!

But I remember Assault Lily being a rare case of one episode being enough for me 'cuz if all you have to reel me in is thigh shots to compensate for needless exposition dumps, I eh... won't be super interested.
The biggest issue I have with SHAFT is knowing how most of the biggest people have moved on so the studio itself since then hasn't really done anything fantastic. I've heard Pretty Boys Detective Club was at least good fun.
Albeit I haven't really watched RWBY, I've heard it is a mixed bag of quality.
Look, given how SHAFT made Assault Lily 2 years ago, I can say them adapting something like RWBY would also be a full on trainwreck lmao
S1 was made in 2018
Or wait, does seasonal mean one season anime stuff?
Uma Musume S2 can also qualify maybe?
Eizouken is def a good one. I'd say Pui Pui Molcar is another memorable thing from last year, though they're shorts.
I've read on what else went down in later episodes, and honestly it seemed like a lazily put together production. Assault Lily as a franchise I hear is very good, I just think the anime is nothing desirable. And that's coming from someone who's normally fairly positive when it comes to writing about things.
We see a concert, we see Noise attack and see how much of a threat they are, then we get some top notch action!
Hell, take my Symphogear example from earlier. We didn't know how Hibiki presumably died. We're being taken to the past and shown all the events culminating in 13's ending. And Hibiki doesn't spoonfeed us any info about Noise or tell us about anything.
Assault Lily right away spoils any tension by saying "Hey, these things called Huge appeared all these years ago and they made us fight them with these cool weapons!"
What made me like YuYuYu was the worldbuilding. I wasn't told right away what the Hero system was or what the Vertexes are.
As I mentioned earlier, you know you've fucked up when I watch one episode of something and say, "I'm good."
Guess my issue with Assault Lily is moreso the writing direction
Can't deny that
Oh yeah the OP and ED are great
It was a doll line first. Now it has stage plays and a mobile game. I know plenty of people that dismiss the anime and prefer the mobile game
<a:TakoJam:792028399915892757>
3gatsu is dope
'Cuz it knows it's over the top and revels in it
Kill La Kill made me laugh my ass off at some spots
Then again I just like mindfuck anime and anything that has crazy action
True
Konosuba try not to laugh challenge

*Insert me sitting there, stone-faced*
I think the dub did him a bit better because Patrick Seitz
Yeah, Dullahan was great
^
I guess it's also because my humor is towards darker/edgier things, hence why I liked Zetsubou Sensei more
Yeah, Konosuba in general hasn't aged as gracefully.
Not just because it makes me get back at my past a bit, but mainly 'cuz wow, this series sure does love running off like a few jokes
There's a reason I meme on it a lot lmao
Konosuba isn't really an isekai but it is a parody of the genre. And at that, its humor hasn't really aged the best.
I remember at first liking Konosuba then really bumping it down once I thought about it in retrospect
I didn't even get to see whatsherface
The first half was ok, then I just felt it got really boring so I dropped it
I remember watching Slime a few years back and tbh that was the anime that made me think "The isekai genre ain't for me"
WEP tripped itself up on its own ambitions already. So I was kind of going into the special with mostly low expectations.
An unsatisfying, very up-in-the-air ending that honestly made me so burnt out with anime watching last year 'cuz I waited 3 months for an inconclusive clusterfuck.
WEP was like a 6 towards the end for me, but the special was... something else.
Here's mine.
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
^
I remember thinking that too when rewatching last year
So Revue I unfortunately have no screencaps for
Well, midway through that year
I haven't watched Revue in 2 years. But I remember with how back in 2020 when I first started screenshotting anime, it was more towards the end of the year that it happened.
Oh yeah, that sounds good.
My PTW is packed
I've got Dress Up Darling to catch up on, then Nichijou, then the Revue anime to rewatch, then the Revue movie
Gonna watch Dynazenon eventually
Oh yeah I'm getting closer to catching up with Sono Bisque Doll
I like how they censor "hentai"
He said the thing!
Anyone else ever see an anime they're interested in then nope out when MAL/AniList says:
Speaking of, I guess the manga just released a new volume today. That's neat.
I think it'd be possible ig? Bisque Doll anime alone sold the manga an extra million copies
With how I'm at 5 episodes behind, I can only hope I can binge tomorrow
Wtf happened to half his face lmao
Honestly I haven't been too deeply interested in RWBY but knowing how Monty envisioned it, it is cool to see it as an anime
Its fanservice is definitely one big draw, but I do really like how Marin and Gojo are as a pairing. Marin herself is such an adorable sunbeam.
Overall, I think Dress Up Darling is such a fun anime. I might read the manga idk.
I have no idea
I did get one really really funny smear out of it
That Dress Up Darling episode was HORNY
Whew, y'all were not lying
Delaying the inevitable Nichijou watch
Been a hot minute since I watched PriPri so maybe after I rewatch Revue I'll get on that
I fucking loved Flip Flappers, so ya know... I'm super excited.
The draw of "Studio 3Hz is making a new original" gets me amped
She's a supporting character according to AniList but yeah, I'm kinda excited for it
Oh yeah I saw Ayahi was in Healer Girls
I'm def going to get into the manga though. The anime was super fun.
I heard it adapted up to around chapter 36 as of episode 11. The manga is still ongoing, so I'll have to watch episode 12 later today
It is stupidly funny
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
YouTube said it was the "most viewed" part
Funny that Crunchyroll itself started as a pirate community.
I just don't watch on CR period lol. I just torrent and sometimes use Animepahe.
üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
Yeah.
Aoi was also in Forces as one of the female avatar voices
JP Sonic has had a consistent voice cast since SA1
Gonna be a treat actually catching a 3Hz anime as it airs. Cuz I never got to do that with Flip Flappers or Princess Principal
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
And we got a release date!
Looked at the website for the new Studio 3Hz anime, Healer Girl
She's not seen it yet I think. Her AniList says planning.
Be that from my good friend Eileen's other friends and other servers
This will be my first time. But I've heard it is simply fantastic.
No.
And watch that movie
So I'm very excited to watch one anime I absolutely adore
I'm gonna be rewatching Revue Starlight next. Aside the movie, I remember watching it when I never took screenshots of anime to help remember
Where the fanservice may not be for everyone, I adored Marin and I love the focus on hobbies and passions deserving to be chased regardless of you finding it hard or even insurmountable.
Alright, I really want a season 2
I think Marin's best casual outfit is this one
Daaaayum, Marin with another good fit
Fwiw the comic answers a few questions, and does see Cole and Zeke talking again. But that ending thing does effectively setup 2 just a bit
That was pretty good!
Just finished the comic.
Poor guy.
Just around the first half hour
Yeah, I haven't really gotten too far into 2 yet
Though I really don't know how hard lightning could pierce a gear
If Cole and Tsubs got into a death battle, however, I'm sure he'd win probably
And the fact he's basically a living electrical outlet
True af
I've heard T rated games use the word before. What changes in comics?
Also for some reason the comic censors "shit" with "s**t"
It's weird that the sequel has a few things it doesn't really answer that the comics do.
Reading the Infamous comic atm
I normally never do until around the last episode
How often do y'all watch anime ED? Just a random question
~~The girls watch snuff to make the deaths look as accurate as possible in a sequel to a beloved story~~
~~Give me New Game but it's dark and makes jabs towards development of specific games~~
Setup March 17th, so maybe they planned it
I've been really looking forward to that as a huge 3Hz fan
Ooh boy, Healer Girl is only 2 days away
Attack on Titan 1.5 +2.5 Final Mix Re:coded Chain of Memories
Just downloaded the first episode
I love these three already
Yeah, so far I'm quite liking it
Unsure how I feel about the characters but the music and art is very nice
Watching the first Healer Girl episode rn. God how I've missed 3Hz
||She was credited at the end of episode 1 for a track. I didn't watch the ED proper due to me just jumping over it since I normally don't watch anime ED.||
||Oh right, but I was meaning a full on proper song.||
Hope we get to hear her sing
One of the supporting Healer Girl characters is voiced by Ayahi
Gosh, I loved it. Visually and musically it's very nice. And I do really like what next week's preview at the end showed. Is Studio 3Hz back? Unsure yet. But I'm very excited nonetheless.
Just finished the first episode
The latter was kind of a surprise departure as while it was cute, it was also really sad
Albeit I have only watched like two from them, Engaged to the Unidentified and Plastic Memories
Doga Kobo is like FromSoft: They have one style of game and somehow each new title manages to be pretty darn good
Revue of War Crimes
Bahh I love her so much
||Picked up on this nifty detail while watching. I remember the first rewatch I noticed the book name. Now seeing Nana's sketchy look reminds me this is the last time loop.||
<a:aBananice:639534343915700224>
Already adoring the hell out of it
It's been 2 years since I first watched it. I'm eagerly going to binge this and watch the movie
YEP
God I'm not even 5 minutes in and already loving this anime again
Kept you waiting, huh?
RIP

Ohhh
Nyaa.si exists
What's an anime you initially liked, but dislike now?
Though I should get started on episode 2 soon.
Any anime that adds in small details on rewatch is great to me. Even Revue has that all I still love it.
I rewatch things dependent on if I liked them. Lain I recall rewatching not even a week after I finished
It's one of those anime where you hear the punchline once. Then it repeats.
But I realized upon watching a few clips that it really didn't hold up.
I was initially thinking about my past being why I disliked it, ya know. Hating something out of spite because you had a bad experience with the community.
For me it's Konosuba. I recall liking it at first, but I feel its humor gets incredibly stale. I'm at that point where I just like the art of the characters and ignore anything to do with the show entirely.
So the hype for this anime was exponential
I know people on the Animemes server are huge into the manga
<:twah:963419596218581023>
Someone likes it so much to the point where their pfp is a smug Anya and there's an emote just for them
On another server
I've heard people talk about how good the manga is
Nice!
So I like ya know, trying to dump my thoughts here to appeal to those that want to see my thoughts but can't access it
This is what I was worried about with posting images in here before. i.e. Revue Starlight, I know a few people here can't access <#407060923078017026>
What kind of pop tarts tho
My brain is just like "Hey you wanna watch that anime tonight?" Only for me to go and play games instead
I've had it on my back burner for awhile because god I wish my attention span was better
Should start episode 2 of Revue soon honestly
Delivering delicious visuals and every ooze of it is filled with creativity. And the way it dives into themes of yuri, adolescence, and deconstructs genres with its episodes make it hands down one of, if not my favorite anime of all time
I guess what makes me like FliFla a lot more outside of rewatching it is how when I come to anime for creativity, Flip Flappers excels at that.
I like Princess Principal, it's just been years since I've seen it
https://myanimelist.net/anime/39763/Shishigari
The director to that had left it and I think has made a movie now?
It's gonna take a miracle for 3Hz to make something on par with Flip Flappers
Not *too* onboard with it just yet, but it's cute
Healer Girl is something I'm only 2 episodes into and I'm quite liking it
"We paid for Chris, we're getting her to sing damnit"
Not even t-posing and the cat is asserting dominance
I love the expansion for the Clone Troopers themselves
Yeah
But in return it has a lot of great content, like everything Darth Maul related.
It sure has its fair share of stupid arcs
I liked 2008 Clone Wars a lot
And the stuff involving a few Clones post-Order 66
Hm... I'm a little mixed on Star Wars Rebels myself but damn do I really like the Darth Maul episodes there
When I saw the camera pan under his saber walking towards kids, I knew where that was going even after it cut out
Damn, I forgot Anakin wasn't the only one who killed younglings
It's so good
His performance is so rage fueled
Sam Witwer hands down does the best voice for the character
Started rewatching the Darth Maul episodes from Clone Wars
Yep
But it's really nice to see Blue Sky went out with a pretty decent set of shorts
They were pretty funny for being short lil animations. I really liked this episode with the teeter totter log because of a certain gag
Idk why but this made me laugh a little too hard
This is from the new Ice Age shorts series
I'm gonna hop into the manga soon
Yep
I can always start the manga, but paaaaaaaaaain
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
"Thank you for watching... March Comes in Like a Lion! We'll meet again!"
No idea why he was so nerfed heading into Episode III. Like, he could've still been a force to be reckoned with if the micro-series was anything to go off of
Of course the 2003 micro-series is also really damn good. It's just a shame it's considered non-canon for no reason despite having the best animated incarnation of Grievous *and* tying into Episode III
It's in filling those gaps that makes the Clone Wars one of my favorite aspects of Star Wars.
What makes the 08 Clone Wars so great is knowing that Dave Filoni wasn't a big fan of the prequels. He wanted to flesh out the world as much as imaginable, even giving the Clone Troopers themselves far more depth.
Given they're behind a lot of the biggest projects like The Mandalorian
Dave Filoni has been hard carrying Star Wars since Disney bought it
Yeah
I forget what season that was? AXZ I think?
This episode has the Flume noodle chute and I'm reminded of that one Symphogear OVA
Thinking of starting the manga from the beginning honestly
Finally gonna watch 3Gatsu's last 3 episodes
It's even more impressive knowing Dee Bradley Baker at first had to record all the Clone Trooper lines separately. Then by the end of the series, he was doing *all* the lines for each trooper in one take
I'm surprised the video itself is even unlisted
Ikr
Which is very good.
The shorts that precede this also makes it fun payoff
Yeah, it's great.
After all these years, Scrat finally got his nut!
This was made by Blue Sky before closing their doors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uuua5lVrdP0
If y'all haven't seen it yet
And they've mentioned that they really dislike the anime
I know someone who likes the mobile game story
Dogs when someone comes home be like

Its best aspect for me is the fact they lean into musical numbers in dialogue. This episode was chock full of that.
Healer Girl isn't up there with Flip Flappers, but it is starting off really good
That episode was so good
I love getting to hear Ayahi sing again
They know how to get really creative with their originals
That's the magic of Studio 3Hz, I guess.
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
"That's one law abiding dragon"
I'm a sucker for stop motion
What is your favorite animation technique?
That's a little odd. You serve under Sony for 3 years and dip just after combining CR and Funi
Pardon me?
https://variety.com/2022/digital/news/crunchyroll-ceo-resigns-1235236183/
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Oh no...Gamigo owns it now...
Played the first Bone game via that free trial thing to the end
I actually remember when WildTangent was a thing HP bundled with PCs and we like
Yeah
A shame that it hasn't been made into a movie/series, as it is a pretty good series of comics
Honestly I was just thinking about that a few days ago
I have the complete collection book in black and white somewhere
Damn, I remember Bone
According to a translation, Land of the Lustrous is gonna continue
https://twitter.com/afternoon_manga/status/1517371395310690304?t=UNAVxjiP19jNZGH2IUPxWQ&s=19
But just for the sake of knowing that the anime ended pretty much on its own terms, where the manga itself I hear continued going plot-wise
Should start from chapter 1 since I do vaguely remember the anime, even have all my screenshots
Been meaning to read the manga myself actually
The manga itself was on a cliffhanger
Land of the Lustrous is possibly going to continue manga-wise
And <@285794457033506816>
You should see this too üëÄ
<@722121666641133608>
Oof
Cuz I know they do GameStop refurbished consoles
Ahhh
For older consoles
So I assume it's pretty much all online now?
Looks like they're wearing a motion capture suit
But I remember when I was a kid those were brand new. Times sure do change, huh?
Damn, makes me glad I picked up a refurbished 360 from a store a few years back in 2018
They are considered holy grails of Lain fans after all
Damn, the Lain VHS is still extremely pricy
Which is hella impressive. Wonder if it's gonna be like that for the other episodes
From what I read, 3 of the 4 episodes were done by a single animator.
I can only hope the BDs add faces because this is a little odd to look at
I like low detail faces like this
Kana's face here is great
That 500GB blue model that looks almost like a One
Makes me glad I at least have a working 360 from that program
I see
No way
I think it's a shame this isn't more popular because I adore Studio 3Hz and seeing them make yet another anime original is great. It isn't as crazy and deep as Flip Flappers nor PriPri levels of engaging, but it is absolutely fun.
Well, voice actress unit I should specify
Healer Girls are an IRL music unit
I mean... I don't have a rating for it yet cuz I wanna wait for it to wrap up before giving it a rating
>Giving us a full blown musical anime
>66% average AniList score, 68% mean
This clip is a true banger
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/917119354473172993/968250511428051004/Healer_Girl_Studying.mp4
Espressivo translates to "With expression or feeling", so perhaps this side manga is being made to flesh out the characters a tiny more
True
(I'm of course referring to the 2011 manga for Gear)
Healer Girl has the characters break out into song often, which would not translate over well into manga.
The Symphogear manga that came out a year before kinda has a lessened impact cuz the songs help to carry the property.
True
https://anilist.co/manga/148087/Healer-Girl-espressivo/
AniList just informed me a new Healer Girls manga got added to their databanks
That one got me
What Isekai does to an anime industry
The foreboding atmosphere, the music, the themes.
I think what makes me like Lain as much as I do is the fascination with anime that benefit from a rewatch to make the pieces click. Lain is perfect at  psychological horror.
You will never look at a ferris wheel the same again <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Serial Experiments Lain is another all time favorite
(and they're all good people)
Wait is it Eileen or Lily? I know too many people named Lily by this point
I know my good friend Eileen is not fond of the anime adaptation
I've heard Magia Record is... Bad
Absolute Configuration is just top notch music too
Rebellion has ||Mami vs. Homura|| which is a very cool scene
Though I did end up liking Rebellion slightly more
Yeah I really liked Madoka watching it for the first time last year
(Totally not a joke relating towards each episode having Pure in its title)
Episode 3 is just pure bliss
Flip Flappers is a love letter to anime in the sense it has so many layers to dissect. It is very much one of the best anime originals to come from Studio 3Hz, and is easily my favorite anime original of all time. Or, at least it and Symphogear fight constantly for that spot.
It's basically one of my all time favorite anime. It has incredibly gorgeous visuals and has plenty of themes hidden within its trippy episodes. Like the Class S Yuri episode that takes place in a school that's also a clock tower that constantly resets.
<:papikaSmile:284172971059314688>
Can I shill Flip Flappers please please please?
It's def one of my fav anime originals
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Hydrogen bombs for two? How cute
Yes
<:Gay:823996995567353916>
Yes. That Revue of Jealousy is my favorite
I guess Hikari/Karen is good too
I like Mahiru and Karen a bit more.
Kaoruko and Futaba my beloved
Picking right back up from where my rewatch left off. Really excited to dive back in!
True
NoWaYu could easily be a fantastic movie
It is a shame that season 3 was just a highlight reel for the stories. I think that's why I didn't watch outside of falling off anime watching in general for awhile last year.
It does aid certain aspects of Hero Chapter, which is why I like it so much. And it's just a very very good story.
Highly recommend doing that as well
^
But I haven't watched it yet
Then "Dai-Mankai no Shou" is season 3
Washio Sumi is a Hero is part 1 of season 2, Hero Chapter is part 2
~~And yet MrEnter hates the movie~~
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
"A ride"
I do remember when he was looking to be cast for Generations, he couldn't cuz his agency said otherwise
I mean, Ryan did voice Sonic in that voice-only audio drama thing a YouTube channel did
<:BocchiHands:660933135050997781>
Since he was a notable voice actor for a time
Huh, I recognize only Brian Drummond
It's so cozy and whimsical.
Every episode I'm left excited for more.
This series is like a weekly dose of comfort
Top Dad looks different
I just reached those episodes and honestly I'm kinda mixed
Yeah I've heard that filler arc brings it down slightly, but it's pretty smooth sailing from there
Also I never got to finish it myself
Watching season 7 of the Clone Wars today because screw it, it's May the Fourth
They *sure* knew what they were doing there
Yeah. Like Super Creek's Halloween one
The mobile game gave them ridiculous jiggle physics
They just now realized how popular Uma is so they're trying to cash in on it
S3 eventually I imagine
I know my friend Kro loves TM Opera O so he'll be very satisfied
From the main anime
What's gonna be cool is this'll be placed on a separate timeline
The new Uma anime is gonna be pretty interesting
https://tenor.com/view/kino-der-toten-gaming-cod-gif-16996337
Me upon finishing Clone Wars season 7's final episode:
It's a pretty decent detour, but I feel more could have been done to make the sisters a little more memorable? Everything just felt padded to beef up for the endgame.
The Ashoka stuff was mostly boring tragically, saved by that ending scene of them preparing to head to Mandalore.
Just reached the final arc of Clone Wars
Hey, at least lower Coruscant is cool. I enjoy the skepticism among the people there towards the Jedi.
I'm just not as engaged with the sisters as I am other main characters
Hell, seeing lower Coruscant again is cool.
I love seeing Ashoka after all this time
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> As someone that watched the first half of Tensura, I can say that's... really goofy to read.
"Melua had never seen such bullshit before."
My favorite anime original always is gonna be Flip Flappers. And it was very much a shame that WEP started off super promising... Then fell off incredibly hard.
Cool character, but what was the point of Frill? We went from sorta grounded story with fantasy elements to fuckin sci-fi ball tripping fest in no time
On the Frill stuff
Divisive
Episode 10 was pretty good but I was kinda...
I liked it til around episode 8. Once the recap happened, the quality took a serious shit
I'm always going to feel pain remembering that special episode
~~Tragically~~
**PARDON**
(Said with a hint of fear)
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Sure.
**Why is there so much honse**

Couldn't afford the money for an instant one
Albeit it was a snail mail ping
My ping worked!
@ Melua
More than I ever interact with the community
I just use AniList as a "Track what I watch" thing
So I've heard
So anything that gets #1 is review bombed
Really biased against anything taking their #1 spot
Spy x Family is currently at like #2 on the top MAL category and FMA fans are like
^
I love it to bits though
Gridman do be an 8
Idk if it lives quite up to other 3Hz shows, but it's super fun in its own right
Unfortunate, it's a very fun time.
Oh.
It's great
And they spend the entire episode singing
There's an entire episode of the girls taking a musical exam for their "healing with songs" power
Yes
<:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
Ayahi is in it and one of the characters likes her character
Oh right!
I hear it's pretty popular in JP
At least in the west
Because I have only seen so many Geah fans in the wide anime range
Yeah that's nutty
It's a very fun show, though it's not gay
You should watch Healer Girl if you haven't already.
Question answered.
Anime fans
Oh I know a friend who loves that one
I can hear something in the distance.
She's so surprised she turned into Rayman!
Ahh
They're the CR subs but eh. I don't mind for a currently airing thing, even if there are a few weird typos.
What subs are you using? I'm planning on eventually replacing them once people upload the BDs but I grabbed the NanDesuKa uploads
Super excited for it!
Gonna have to watch that new episode tonight
Even the head looks like it's saying "Uh oh!"
Me playing MechWarrior 3 one time and forgetting to install heatsinks into my Gauss build for a mech
Or if you're on an old old version of Windows, you can crash your PC with ctrl + alt + delete
Ctrl + Shift + Escape
Cool!
üëÄ
Ahhhh
Those look like the enemies you'd encounter on the Ghost Ship in Republic Commando
I liked the designs of Super Battle Droids and Droidekas
Oh right
Then Battle Droids in the Prequels were just comedy all the time.
I still find it goofy looking at how the Stormtroopers were kinda menacing if goofball at times like that guy who hit his head on the door. Albeit that was an unintended thing, it was still funny.
The Droid saying "Oh my God!" had me laughing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AdKFw1V-b3w
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
THAT'S WHAT I WAS THINKING OF
Yeah that's very true
It just seems really odd
This summary is really weird. It reads to me like the author liked Yuri but at the same time was kinda bored of Yuri being a focus in most manga, so they wanted to make a het relationship thing in a world full of gay or something.
^
"Meteors that turn people gay" sounds like an InfoWars conspiracy theory
This is the most ridiculous description I've read for anything

True
Should really watch S2 and 3 of Zetsubou Sensei someday
This is one of my favorite reaction images

The channel was talking about other things anyway. Just saw it on another server and thought I'd share it here
Aw damn, that was all the way up but w/e

@ yuri fans
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1525439016681676800
That's kind of funny coming from a fanfiction author, I know.
It's why I enjoy anime/manga, since I get to see these characters without having to imagine them.
It's a good read but I'm in the same camp as Yumi. The sparing visuals make it a bit difficult for me to read.
I've only read one LN, Washio Sumi is a Hero
I've brought up Nyaa on a few instances
Yes
What Half-Life game is this?
And makes banana themed confectionaries
Even has banana pillows
Hope she enjoys!
||Was informed by my good friend that this was from last year's performance. A few months before the series begins.||
(Revue Rewatch) ||Wait, if this played at the beginning of the third episode and knowing what we know with Nana later, is this from the first time she made time loop?||
üè¥‚Äç‚ò†Ô∏è
Well, considering I use Nyaa already
I've been hella excited to watch it
I think today I'll binge as many episodes as I can.
Since I like being in my room watching anime. Albeit I do it wearing headphones and all, but a bit of privacy is nice.
My schedule for anime watching is specifically tied to waiting for my older brother to get out of bed
Maybe limit how much I use my PC ig
Yeah, that's true
I know. I'm just finding it hard to find the time for it
I've had Revue Starlight unfortunately hung up on episode 3 for the past weeks and I'm wanting to really continue it given I love the series.
So... how do y'all ever watch your way through an anime?
One of the best anime originals period.
<:waaaaaaaaaaa:350746642825347072>
Flip Flappers love
Yeah
I totally get it
Though comparing a TV anime to a movie is kinda... eh?
I gave Madoka an 8/10 in retrospect, and I feel like the slow pacing was part of why.
Yep!
Remembering how good S1 was
God I'm feeling like watching S2 and S3 of Zetsubou and reading the manga
<a:TakoJam:792028399915892757>
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dch6_-DdHjk
Hey, that was some cool ass imagery though
It's fine
Oh
Whatever that was
Homura's wing growing thing
Same. I liked that post-credits teasing Rebellion.
It is incredibly harsh
Me neither
Specially since they gave it a 3/10. But I'm not gonna crap on their opinion at all.
It's an interesting take to say the least
Their Anilist note from Madoka Magicka
Yeah... I've heard a friend discuss their gripes with Madoka, specifically how some character development doesn't feel there.
I haven't thought about YuYuYu in awhile but I recall liking the characters enough.
To Madoka?
It's very good
I think that the light novel Washio Sumi is a Hero is the only thing I'd actually recommend side material wise
That is understandable honestly
There were generations before them and lore built around that
That's what made me like YuYuYu, as it wasn't just about the main cast
It's not like Yuuki Yuuna where there's all the "generational" stuff in terms of side content I think
Yeah
I've heard from a friend that Tart Magica is fun
Thanks!
I've only seen the 2011 anime and Rebellion
<@246678192360783872> Speaking of adpatation stuff, would you recommend checking out side material?
Finished the episode a bit ago but I love this detail
Lain is also one of my favorite anime, in general psychological horror stuff is why I loved Paranoia Agent
From what I've read of the synopsis and seen of images, it does look to be up my alley. I dig the visual aesthetic.
Since I liked Paranoia Agent
I've been contemplating which of their films is a great starting point
Speaking of Satoshi Kon, should I give Perfect Blue or Paprika a watch next?
And now, a screenshot from Paranoia Agent presented with no context
I'm hoping it won't be too long til movie 4 comes out
Oh cool!

K-On looking different
Ayahi really said, "I already performed at a school festival once. I'm not slaying it again."
FIFTEEN seasons?
What?
Yeah, I think it's easily one of the best animated Star Wars things
Pardon?
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Interesting. Not as interested in it as I once was, but it's cool to see those who stuck around wanting another anime to be getting more.
** I ' M C U T E ? ! **
I'm surprised it's airing new stuff
Disney XD turned into the equivalent of the Nicktoons channel, a graveyard for old shows and some syndicated
I enjoy how atmospheric this arc is. Also one of those arcs that helps flesh Anakin out.
Liam Neeson voicing Qui-Gon is nutty
Watching that ghost arc of the Clone Wars again
<:HibikiSad:738234648509022368>

I kinda forgot 3Hz did that
They did that A3 thing
There's stuff that does click pretty well on a second or third go
I think FliFla benefits from a rewatch
So who knows
He left Valve recently
Can only hope we get that TF2 comic issue 7 someday
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Saw this on r/tf2
Wonder if it is actually out there
Yet it's showing it hasn't aired yet or anything on MAL
Huh.
https://myanimelist.net/anime/39763/Shishigari
But it hasn't been released yet
I saw they were doing something on MAL
They did a whole ass insert song and everything
The giant robot episode was stupidly fun
Love how half the credits of that episode were just M.A.O.
Absolutely
Yes
I loved the grandma one
Well, scratch that
Best FliFla episode is hands down that school one with the clock tower to me
<:YayaCocoKiss:535949592680726554>
Damn, talk about devotion
78 episodes right?
But knowing how long it is, I'd wanna at least shred my backlog down first
And quite honestly I'd wanna give it a go since it's a weird mindfuck
I know people on another discord who love it
I'd wanna watch it too but I hear about how daunting it is
Then Actas took it
...
PriPri was co-animated with Actas
Aren't they also handling that new Devil is a Part Timer
But it's a cozy series
It's not up there with PriPri or Flip Flappers
Healer Girl recently has been nice.
Yayaka vs. Cocona easily my favorite fight
I do vaguely remember it being delayed because COVID
It's still one of those headscratchers since the pacing of the arcs is equal to a Saturday morning cartoon.
Ah, you mentioned that
The Clone Wars movie wasn't really meant to be a movie afaik
And Paprika but I'll watch that later
I know they're completely different films but I have both on my PTW
Between Perfect Blue and Ghost in the Shell, I'm not sure what movie I'd wanna watch first
I'm not a tank nerd but I'm sure I might get a kick out of it
Ahhh
Watching Ghost in the Shell and Perfect Blue eventually
I should watch GUP eventually but I have 20 anime on my backlog and plan on maybe watching through most during the Summer
I'm never not going to be bitter remembering WEP
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Yeah, that's pretty fair.
Actas being Actas I suppose. Why release a second season or a movie to wrap things up when you can do **several movies** instead
It being 6 parts is a deterrent to me. I'd rather just wait around
A format I initially used watching anime last year and the year prior, I've been on episode 3 since last week and I feel it's a good idea to have that format since it's a 12 episode show
Also thinking of rewatching Revue tomorrow, but tackling 3 episodes a day
Post credits were a little jarring
New Healer Girl was pretty good
Gonna plan on that when Crown Handler part 3 releases prob just so I'll have an anime and half of a 6 part movie series to watch
I should rewatch PriPri
<:doroppai:960956865490063450>
From today's Healer Girl
<@87512939107450880> How's this look?
I have Nichijou downloaded atm and haven't started that yet either
Oh yeah I should also get started on that anime too
Game of Mission it was called
But it didn't last that long
PriPri did have its own mobile game
I can't imagine reading something for that long, let alone watch the anime with all its filler in between
All I can say is I admire the devotion.
Did someone say
Rather on the nose

Hey, you suggested psychological horror and that was the first thing that came to mind
I could nerd out about this series all day, I love it.
There's also a bit of late 90s CGI in there too for good measure!
It's a very eerie series. With a foreboding, slow atmosphere. For 1998, it still manages to look pretty solid over 24 years later in the color palette department.
The line between reality and The Wired begins to blur
Lain Iwakura is a 14-year-old middle schooler who's recently heard of a fellow classmate committing suicide. However, when she goes onto her computer, the deceased classmate leaves an ominous email saying "I've merely abandoned my physical self." and that a God lives in the Wired (the Internet).
Serial Experiments Lain is one of my favorite psychological horror anime
Psychological horror?
I need to see that one meme now lmao
**Guitar solo**
Konosuba season 3? Cringe!
Ooooh
Would personally enjoy a Star Wars Studio 3Hz short
NO WAY
https://twitter.com/starwars/status/1531009450655424512
Their appearance in Clone Wars season 7 was a treat though
I liked the characters but haven't watched the series yet
Oh right I think it was <@228659769404030976>
Hell, seeing Stormtroopers already around
It's kind of a cool series from what little I've seen. What I like about Obi-Wan specifically is seeing the universe Post-Order 66. Seeing how the Empire slowly began forming.
That must've been someone else mb
Ohhhh
Ik you aren't big on Bad Batch but regardless I'm kind of excited

Oh my god
I can't hate it lmao
This is the most early 2000s thing I've ever seen
Yeah
Season 1 is nice, just plays it generally safe. That's not too bad though.
I like season 2 a lot more, but season 1's good
Finally, Season 1 alternate ending
Literally what I was gonna say
Train anime?
This OP is fun
Seen people talk about how unironically banging this anime is but I haven't been watching any seasonals sans Healer Girl
From the screenshots I've seen and story arcs I've heard about, this sounds amazing and ludicrous
Birdie Wing looks stupidly fun
Right
Ahhh
Never heard of an anime with that many episodes in a season
Oh god
Or did you start 2 awhile ago? I don't remember
Is this still season 1?

New Tatami sequel trailer
YOOOOOOOOOO
WHOA
Haven't watched Bad Batch yet, but they even capture and reprogram 'em there. Interesting to know...
Early on, a Droid picks up an electrical grenade that deactivates him and his brethren. The Republic really could've used more of those to capture 'em.
It only happened twice in Clone Wars, but I can think of at least one method that was previously highlighted in the video when they were talking about Droids being dumb.
They do bring up a good point later in: In a season 3 arc where R2 has reprogrammed battle droids to help out, why didn't they do this a little more often?
A video talking about the Prequels, but also Clone Wars and a hint of Rebels
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ExOO11vf3u4
I'd make an America joke but that's low hanging fruit
Seeing a young Ria sing in her Chris voice made me scream for like 10 minutes
Healer Girl this week was great fun
I should watch Haruhi but know of the ED and dance
Haven't seen this but know a few people here enjoy it/know about it

Better late than never I suppose!
Too bad I joined in on the party quite late
Someone on another server wanted me to give it a go and I went into it with not much expectations, but I'm interested
Just finished episode 1. This is totally something I can get behind and am def sticking along for the ride
A little Pac-Man made a cameo on Aoi's ball too!
Ahh makes sense
This golfing anime is also a fucking gunpla ad?
Then again we have a manga all about meteors that turned people gay so you can write just about anything ludicrous in manga it seems.
Very weird.
I hear of people on other servers I'm on saying the manga is actually pretty solid but that concept alone is...
Of course I haven't watched Digimon but was made aware of him being the writer after looking at his AniList staff profile
I can't believe the same guy who wrote mindfuck Lain also wrote Digimon Tamers
Yeah
He wrote a stage drama where the main antagonist was an embodiment of political correctness and used "cancel culture" as an attack
The writer for Lain did get into a bit of controversy last year though for something he wrote for Digimon
So of course I'm gonna love it
But this is on the table cuz I love the gritty style and it has the Lain character designer *and* writer
I've other anime I intend on getting to first though
Planning on watching this soonish
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u3SzOzm8lmo
Just downloaded the other 9 episodes too so <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
That'd be nice
Sangatsu üôè
Not like Birdie Wing is bad, though. I'm quite enjoying it!
All this time I could be spending progressing my Revue rewatch I instead allocate to gay girls playing golf.
There's a lot more to this world than the Golf craziness that I've seen in just these first 3 episodes
I think a season 2 would be neat ig? I was a bit interested in the world around Birdie Wing a bit
A shame, as I'm enjoying this so far.
Saw this on another server and I remember someone mentioning how it seemed like it was building up to be a 2 cour thing.
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1535192958089105408

<@722121666641133608> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lLUHoREeLDw

Still mildly amused by the Gunpla advertising even though I understand why it's there
I never expected an anime about golf to have Mafia ties and this stuff
Dynazenon character designer <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
And OPs
The Zetsubou Sensei EDs are trippy af
~~Fr~~
Where I think Konosuba's impact on the industry really shows is how Isekai afterwards tried to be parodies just like it. And I believe this is where it negatively reflects on it. The anime that inspired other anime... Wasn't even funny to begin with...
Sorry to get all bitter on y'all
It's that kind of thing I'm glad I shook myself out of. Besides, I'm someone who much prefers psychological stuff like Lain or Paranoia Agent. If I wanted to escape reality for awhile, I'd lose myself in a video game.
I choose to look back on those days and wonder, "What really was I thinking getting into this?"
I recall it was the first proper anime I got into. At least not counting Naruto or the likes. It was also one of the first discord communities I joined relating to anime. That server alone was how I got into Symphogear, which is a plus, but I have trouble enjoying the series based on my poor reputation in that community given who I was 2 years ago. Aside that, I just also have a different taste in anime as a whole now.

Watching Konosuba until I laugh
<:ranylul:971529396382998658>
**Smart to avoid**
Yeah, Konosuba is smart
What
Very
Fine by me, I got my Revue rewatch to still finish
I have Birdie Wing to watch but even that's nearing the end of its run
Oh yeah prob
That or Ria is just a nickname she prefers? I really dunno
Prob yeah
||I just thought Ria was her proper name but Maria works too.||
(New Healer Girl) ||Maria is the name of the teacher for the girls and she's voiced by Ayahi... Huh.||
The movie is going to break me?
In full swing
Need to watch this soon. After Healer Girl and Birdie Wing are over, it is in fact Revue rewatch time
But I think Wall-E will always be my favorite Pixar movie
Yeesh, it has a 100% on Rotten Tomatoes?
Critically it got more or was about on par with the first.
I hear a lot of people praise it as much as the original
It's so ridiculously cool though
The randomly generated golf course in Birdie Wing is def Bandai-Namco trying to flex their budget lol
And now we have one of the best animated movies of all time.
9 months too btw. They had *9 months* to redo the entire film because they were unsatisfied with it.
Yep!
I recall awhile ago watching videos discussing how the film's development was pretty messy too
Toy Story 2 was a kind of heavy movie looking back honestly
It was the entire flashback segment with her former owner, Emily. Who grew out of her and basically abandoned her.
Jessie's backstory <:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
That'd be genuinely nice. Toy Story has been known to tug at the heartstrings before.
Damn
~~Or do a prequel about Andy's dad and the events leading into the first Toy Story~~
That right there? Fantastic point!
Yeah!
Toy Story 2 is one of the all time greats.
Shit, it's been years since I watched the first 2 movies.
Hell reading the synopsis, it's... odd? Toy Story always seemed grounded. Outside of the toys coming to life idea, I liked how grounded things were. This seems like an ass pull. "Hey, that toy? He was based off a real hero!" whereas Woody was just a toy based off a cowboy series.
<:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>
Why tf isn't that on Disney+
God this just reminded me Buzz Lightyear of Star Command exists
Yeah
Yeah. And probably just to have Buzz Lightyear not portrayed by someone that won't get them flack. Since I hear Tim Allen was fairly controversial outside of Toy Story due to political views.
I wasn't super amped for it either, but even then it's good to know it isn't terrible, just forgettable.
Honestly that's... not surprising?
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Wrong channel prior but this is neat
https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/06/guillermo-del-toro-pinocchio-first-look
This second rewatch also sees me screenshotting it because my original one and first watch were before I began screenshotting anime to remember
Hell, I'm only 3 episodes into my second rewatch and I still am finding neat things
It's a great one
I know someone who has rewatched it 20 times over
How else am I gonna nod along to bangers?
Given I watch anime on my phone I always wear headphones
Yep!
But hey, watching it on a phone shouldn't be too bad
I remember there being a showing at the beginning of the month at my local theater but I didn't go <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
Hey, this does motivate me to continue my Revue rewatch <:waaaaaaaaaaa:350746642825347072>
Rewatching the anime would be an option since it's been a few months and I can't remember much outside of a few scenes, but eh
I'm planning on possibly starting the 3Gatsu manga
I'm eager to try AB and I already have Eva on my PTW
If it were possible, would the movie be an 11?
That's what my rewatch is for
Oh my god I'm gonna love it
Damn, a character with a prosthetic arm in anime? Something Hibiki should have gotten in G. Or a robot arm.
Guess who just caught up with gay golf girls?
This happened in Princess Principal too from what I remember
Anytime I see this in anime it's always so jarring.
Didn't expect Eve to let out a bit of English lmao
Isn't Bleach also getting a manga adaptation of the final arc too?
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
This looks fantastic
No way they can cram them into those 2 episodes
There's so many characters we haven't seen yet in the OP
If Symphogear can get five seasons worth of content plus OVAs, golf girls can too!
Me too.
I will ping you for it.
When I get to Shirobako?
Oh trust me
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
These coming weeks are gonna be stacked for me
Eva just finished downloading, so did the Revue movie
So <#977744682035605514> might have some highlights
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Tomorrow at 1PM I'll also be continuing my Revue rewatch too
Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Did find a version in 1080p for 8.4GB at least
Finding an upload on Nyaa for Evangelion atm and holy smokes 55.6GB?
Cowboy Bebop and FLCL are classics however, and the latter is only 6 episodes long
Of the ones I've been anticipating the most, Eva and Texhnolyze are up there
I'll probably watch Eva as I've been looking for psychological things to sink my teeth into. And I have plenty of that list already
Cool!
That episode length is a little too daunting for me atm but it's certainly a show I'll watch once I clear a nice chunk of the list
I do have Nichijou downloaded on my phone still
But once that's finished it's free reign
So uhh, what would y'all like me to get to first? I have Revue to rewatch and watch the movie
My PTW is stacked as hell
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Haven't watched that one yet but why
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Can't wait for all the memes where it's like "There's no CGI in this movie, he just punched these people once and they died!"
~~Welcome to the UK~~
Gonna watch that tonight <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Sora Yori asks the question: "Have you ever wanted to cry at emails like Republicans in 2016? Now you can!"
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Hoping we get more tbh, it seemed like such a fun series and I kind of crave more.
Healer Girl ended pretty nicely.
0/10 very inaccurate. They would have billed her for standing around.
Oh pog new CoG
Prob doesn't mean much but eh

Aww, Loris hates me now too
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
I personally read Nogi Wakaba is a Hero per request of one of my Yuuki Yuuna loving friends and where it does add a few pieces of story context, you can still not read it and enjoy the series.
"I can get by if I know there's stuff I'm missing"
The latter of which is one of the best stories to come out of it
A few short stories, one light novel
Imo its deepest issue is the fact there's a shitton of side media for you to understand Hero Chapter
Washio Sumi is a Hero is one of the best pieces of content to come out of it though.
I enjoy it, but it varies
I love how it makes golf incredibly hype to ludicrous degrees while also having a few darker subplots
That has to be seen to be believed
^
^
Gay golf girls
My day just got 10x better
FUUUUUUCK YEAH
The OP, the visuals, hell I dug Ayahi's performance in general.
Healer Girl is great
When's the memorial service?
~~I will gush over this anime every opportunity I get~~
Flip Flappers will forever be my favorite anime original though tbh
I think that's why I like originals a lot more. Except Wonder Egg cuz fuck Wonder Egg
The VR episode was so fun
It's the Topdadverse
Apparently Birdie Wing saw a spike in viewership as it continued airing in Japan, so maybe that was one of the factors?
Ahhh, that'd make sense
Birdie Wing really closed out its last season episode like it was going to air a 14th episode next week wtf
She woke up today and chose violence
Oh yeah great dub VA
Quinton Flynn right?
I like how absolutely ludicrous it is. It's basically golf Symphogear with a bit more competent writing.
^
And immigrant children with the possibility of their lives on the line
Golf mafia
Then we get fucking
I remember when I first started it thinking, "Oh it'll be golf with a few anime-esque ludicrous elements."
||Look, ma! No hand!||
Amazing
I saw a clip of that
Oh my god wasn't that in the dub lmao
But it looks fun
Wasn't quite *massively popular*
SK8 I should watch eventually cuz I saw that was mildly popular around the time I was watching Wonder Egg on that discord
The PV for S2 shows we still might see Golf Mafia stuff.
19, 20, 21, 22, etc.

It's time I start episode 4... next week.
That reminds me, I was on episode 3 of Revue when I was starting my rewatch awhile ago
Found this on another server, thought of you
<@722121666641133608> https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MM5fVd_ETjk&feature=emb_title
Waiting one week for that awesome scene with Mami and Homura was way worth it
It's not a movie to jump right into after the series
And tbh I couldn't blame her
Melua told me to take a week off before starting it
You could say I watched it at just the right time
I know I just watched it last year but I do have plenty of hype for the sequel
OOHH
Ooh
Hoping that Madoka movie 4 gets more info soon tbh
I am aware there was a cliffhanger ending
Ahh
The friend who got me to watch KLK is also a huge fan of P&S
This gives me all the reason to actually watch it
And Luluco is also set in the same universe?
Isn't there some sequel manga thing too?
Given I enjoyed KLK
Speaking of I should watch that too eventually
Lol
Mahiru my beloved.
Damn, just ticked all the anime school setting after class boxes
Can't expect a studio to pump out something as big and ambitious as Madoka movie 4 in under a year after it's announced
Though I think I'll give it another year or so
No Madoka 4 news sadge
She's so pretty and cute and I love her
Have I ever mentioned my undying love for Mahiru Tsuyuzaki from Revue Starlight?
~~It's already better than the game by default cuz Trigger~~
Yeah
Huh, this doesn't look half bad.

Bandicoot month is his yearly thing for Crash Bandicoot content but he normally does it during June
Oh wait it's Bandicoot Month I forgor
Wtf he made another Crash video?
What a fantastic episode, though
And I never expected that ending to hit as hard as it did

üëÄ
Ooh.

Indeed

Why did she have to make a song so good
Christ, I'm listening to Mahiru's revue song again
That's cool

I was just saying I rarely see anime with exclamations being like a big part in the title
Oh yeah I know
Is it like how New Game has so many exclamations?
Everyone's gay for Eve

Screenshot taking and live posting my way through it on another discord has been a bit more time consuming than I thought it would, but hey. At least I'm screenshotting now so I won't have to when I watch it again 20 times over.
Pretty excited to be finally getting through Revue again. If anything I hope future rewatches are a lot more faster.
The instrumental fly me to the star at the end is the cherry on top.
Good god that episode is still brilliant.

Which is part 1 of season 2
Well, there is Washio Sumi is a hero
It's sad to think how many people since the beginning of One Piece or other long running series had died before the end.
Oof
Honka
That explains it <:woWonayiM:833581261925908510>
Yeah. Shouji Saeki is director for Luminous
And considering how that was... a thing...
Same director as Assault Lily iirc
When Hikari's blade unraveled? Hypest shit imaginable.
Holy shit was Revue episode 8 just as good as I remember
Damn, even when Karen was a kid she was thinking of terrorism smh
GIRLS. IN. SUITS. PRETTY.
Magic space bicycle sounds like something you'd hear in a preschool animation
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
Wonder why they made an entirely new cast up for this dub.
Nor is Bridget Hoffman KOS-MOS, or Dave Wittenberg Allen.
"That's not Crispin Freeman as Albedo wtf" was my first thought

The dub VAs are all... not there.
I look at the IMDb page for it and uhhh
...
I saw Xenosaga the Animation was uploaded by someone on YouTube and I'm kind of sickeningly curious to watch it
KINO
YOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I loved Right Back at Ya so I wouldn't mind if they did something similar and adapted a few of the games
Another Kirby anime
Would certainly like a Kirby anime tbh
The girls are alright, we promise.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@306647346643468298>
I love that gif
I'm sure it is. I'm just a little disappointed in myself for not being able to keep up with this hobby and instead find myself playing Xenosaga and other stuff lol
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Sometimes I just don't watch an episode at all
God, I wanna really finish my Revue rewatch but I hate that I only find myself watching an episode per night
Now we get isekai every year <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Mb
Oh
I hear it's one of the best CGDCT shows
What's wrong with it?
I'm sure Shinkalion will be my next big anime because Gaogaigar is up there as one of those things I will gladly be watching
~~Do I need to bring my inhaler for this~~
This sounds like an absolute treat
LMAO
If I had the time or want to watch, I probably would just for the movie
That's bonkers
What the FUCK
Is it *that* good to warrant a meme 10/10?
Damn haven't heard that name in years
A Foster's home reboot too wtf
https://tenor.com/view/kingdom-hearts-axel-two-axel-two-kh-gif-13046226
Interesting.
Yes it's Bloo
Her lower half isn't moving at all oml
But oml the way her body is animated here is so funny
Cute
I hate it
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
YuYuYu. I have not watched it in years, but it took me months to rewatch S1.
I've only ever heard of it and how meh it is
Ohhhh that one
Oh god, what is it?
AND YOU DON'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND
https://vxtwitter.com/rawanimeops/status/1550895788817059840?t=UdzVnUarRftLmIb4QGJoQQ&s=19

Which is a shame, because I hear it adapts the best Light Novel in the series for a few episodes.
I remember watching S1/WaSuYu/Hero Chapter in 2020 but I didn't watch that new S3
I recall loving Washio Sumi
ABSOLUTELY ACCURATE
Which I'm due to find myself rewatching since I saw it in a groupchat awhile ago and have fuzzy memories of it aside a few moments
And March Comes in Like a Lion
I liked Sayonara Zetsubou Sensei... or at least the one season I saw of it
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
BILL COSBY
He's a huge yuri fan so of course he'd reject cringe het
Love Live
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

AMAZING
I await the MGS fan art
Domestic Girlfriend's OP is great but my sense of humor is so fried that "Neussy" makes me fucking wheeze
The only het thing I genuinely enjoyed is Plastic Memories, but that's about it
Oh yeah I've grown to realize that with anime for awhile
TIL Xenosaga Episode 1's English dubbing studio was the same one that dubbed Cowboy Bebop
I'm sure even at 40% on my headset he'd still be loud af
It's been years but I remember...
Lmao yeah
Old YouTube let's player
AMAZING
Same
<:this:647197773044645888>
A 10/10 in my book

Yeah, you might have to rewind a few times
Same!
Since it's on Disney Plus, I wonder if they'll dub it or not
Same

"Eminem is the fastest rapper alive."
Tatami Galaxy:
It is a pretty fast anime, I imagine it's one of those dubs that would require a ton of effort based on how fast the original anime is alone.
Yeah, it's a fantastic one.
MGS is that series I know a lot about from watching the cutscenes and people playing it, but find it tough to play on my own
I should really play MGS1 again, I never properly finished it
I love Otacon so much
Solid Snake or The Boss are tied for my main favorite
He is probably my other favorite MGS character, if only cuz I love his nerdiness
Oh my god
No way, the Metal Gear Solid character has a convention???
Holy fuck that took awhile
Healer Girl, Birdie Wing, the other half of Revue
Having to sort and categorize several anime I did recently watch

<@266379640069685252> <@722121666641133608> I can finally watch that movie!
After so many months of holding off, I'm proud to say I finally finished my Revue Starlight rewatch.
Ntm when I watch something, I kind of want my room to at least not be crowded so I can focus
For a phone? No.
I'll probably wait another week.
<:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
Then Devin wanted to talk with his friend and took the headset.
Was gonna watch the Revue movie and got everything setup...
I believe even perfection can be flawed. A 10/10 still might have its problems. That's true for many things.
Sonic Adventure 2 is one of my all time favorite video games, but I don't excuse Mad Space or the nerfed emerald radar and call it a 10/10 masterpiece.
We as fans criticize Symphogear, or any anime, because we love it and know it could be better.
Yep.
To the point of criticizing it despite loving.
I'm very surprised to be this involved with such a niche anime.
Cuz I do dig angst
Given I'm not much of a fanfiction reader, I probably should give My Sunshine a read
"What do we do with our new villain trio and this mysterious, powerful guy?"
"We have Saint Germain get development, Cags be there just for fun, and Prelati? Who's Prelati?"
"Aren't you forgetting someone?"
"Oh, the bathtub guy! Uh... Adam just sits there and appears like once to nuke a building. Then he appears again."
You already spent 2 seasons on hype that were frankly hit or miss for many.
You can tell seasons going forward were style over substance. And when they tried going back to character related storytelling, it was too late by XV.
That is one of the kinder ways to explain why GX and AXZ went the way they did.
G is pretty much why I liked Maria. She was setup to be such an interesting character, then she only gets used properly in the first few episodes.
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
It blew my mind knowing it was a year after S1
This focus on characters is why I end up liking S1 and G. Even if the latter gets terribly messy.
The cliches definitely show more in S1, but I think that adds to why I enjoy it. It knows the story it's telling isn't the most special, but it does what it can to establish its world and characters and does it well.
Yeah, that'd make sense
Oh, how wrong they were.
...
Hell, the person who introduced the series to me said it was the weakest
At first, I didn't quite get the love for S1
A lot of people shit on it despite it being hands down one of the best directed seasons.
S1 first is totally reasonable.
Should've genuinely had Genjuro try and throw hands to show how supposedly powerful this guy is
Adam just farts around in a bathtub for the entire season, popping in once or twice
Yep.
But even then, there's a few things that really should've been written better.
I did like AXZ slightly better because the heroes weren't getting tossed around as much tbf.
<:kanahana2:273359134286544896>
Who am I to shit on people's tastes while being a Sonic fan though
But GX being your favorite? <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
XV being ranked that low is... ok imo? I could get why,  given it does have a few underwhelming aspects.
I should give GX a rewatch soon to see if it's really as bad as I thought it was
G>S1>XV>AXZ>GX
Except maybe Eyepatch Wolf
Anitubers in general bad
I avoided it
Yeah...
But when I heard they severely cut down Nogi Wakaba is a Hero?
Then WaSuYu and Hero Chapter I didn't really rewatch either
Was gonna watch after my rewatch of S1, but that took a long time
Yeah, I avoided watching season 3
But no, they actually aired this on a PBS station. And G4/TechTV
I didn't even know this was a thing and thought Wikipedia was bluffing
Why is Bleach's 3rd OP one of the most hype OPs in anime ever?
I know this isn't the dumbest isekai idea, but <:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
Fucking what
https://twitter.com/AIR_News01/status/1555751027839643648
Prob need an app like Kodi or whatever it's called
Last time one of my older brother's friends decided to call him up so I couldn't do anything. I'm trying to think of a means to stream it from my phone onto the TV and get screenshots later.
I'm finally going to watch the Revue movie tomorrow I hope
Watching my fav movie again!
It sounds like the IRL equivalent of a keysmash
It's an isekai. The concept and title are meant to be baffling.
(Is anyone surprised)
I only know about it because of Mamako
Oh yeah that one
"That Time I Got Reincarnated as Your Mom" when
Guess I could watch the Revue movie Sunday then cuz that bed we were waiting for arrived. And now I won't be falling off it anymore
I can and will say that, if AniList had an 11/10, this would be it.
1hr52m53s <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Was so close to finishing, then dinner got ready. But I'm like *near* the end of the Revue movie
And it's so fucking good.
I'm so happy to be watching it now. After all this time.
Yeah I should have specified
Revue Starlight movie spoilers ||Nana goes beast mode and singlehandedly defeats everyone||
I'll share my thoughts afterwards. But this movie lives up to the hype.
Revue of Annihilation. I have no words to describe what I have witnessed.
18 minutes in, is it bad I already feel a little broken inside?
Watching the Revue movie rn
The reason we get Boruto and other anime continuations after they end
https://tenor.com/view/hello-money-giveittome-mr-krabs-spongebob-gif-4184913
Of all the things to get delayed for, "Highschool baseball" is not something I'd think would cause it

https://twitter.com/LL_Wikia/status/1556208926927908864?t=TJYYFRdERaB95Uqzx7WCcw&s=19
I should watch those again, I remember having those on tape.
Good choices too
It's one of my all time favorite movies
To think we're in a world similar to it at the moment. Before I leave Earth, let me at least take a Wall-E aboard!
Wall-E really is one of those movies I can watch over and over again. I remember going to see it in theaters in 2008 with my grandma, and I think it was one of those first movies to capture my imagination. Aside its humor, the story and worldbuilding are gripping.
I was just saying yeah I'll probably watch it
Yeah, I'm aware.
LR looks absolutely dope
People are really wanting me to watch this new Lycoris Recoil anime. I'd love to but y'all know I happen to wanna be focusing on other things like watching the Revue movie and all
Wall-E is a movie I absolutely love to bits. I kind of wanna watch it again <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
"Define Dancing" is among one of my top 10 movie scenes ever
And hasn't been made available on Disney Plus or even physical outside of the DVD/VHS version of the movie
Yeah, it was really short lived because of that one Disney rule with animated series getting to a certain number
I saw it was on Disney Plus and I'm kinda tempted to give it a watch
I'm a fan myself but acknowledge it's incredibly mediocre

(Revue Starlight movie thoughts)

||It's not often I find myself in awe at everything in a production. From the moment it started, Revue Starlight the Movie proved itself as an absolute masterclass. Its gorgeous visuals backed by phenomenal music, the Revues themselves cranked up to 11, Characters and themes worth analyzing. This movie has it all.

A small listing of my favorite Revues (From the second half of the movie):

1. Revue of Hunting (Tied with Final Line)
2. Revue of Competition
3. Revue of Resentment
4. Revue of the Soul

I'll warm up to some of them eventually when I inevitably rewatch it. After all, I didn't screenshot anything watching it. So I will have to just so I have things for my collection.||
Just now finished. That was... A fuckin brilliant movie.
Yeah, I'm absolutely going to share my thoughts here in a minute
Or could have. But I'm a few minutes closer.
Huh, I lucked out. With dinner stalled due to some electrical happenings, I can finish it
What's weird is this starts with Deus when it should start with Navi
Lain, the way it was meant to be watched
Oh no way someone did it
https://archive.org/details/lain_vhs/
And this isn't even the complete set!
Alright, this is the craziest one
I check the eBay listings for Lain on tape for seeing the insane prices they're sold at

THE KINO RETURNS
KINO
IT IS
Some cool art though!
I read the first chapters to that. It's neat, but I didn't get super hooked like I thought.
Who does that üíÄ
Weird how the video here cuts out the "PRESENT DAY PRESENT TIME" part tho
I have the series and OP/ED on my laptop already but this is a hella useful site. I only knew about the one anime themes sub but didn't know it had a site
Oh cool

What's good about this movie is there's so much to unpack so I'm genuinely excited for more screenies for me to peep at.
I'd like to properly sit down and rewatch next weekend since I did manage to get my first watch in, but it was interrupted by dinner.
Did manage to get plenty of screenshots up to the 43m29s mark

Makima fans in Heaven rn
"Shinji, name me one song by Pantera."
Misato really said "Next time, I'll give you fanservice!" In episode 2's preview lmao
I'm so excited
Yes, thank you!
Ooh she's pretty.
So look forward to the first 4 episodes this weekend
I'll toss my thoughts of the first 2 episodes in <#977744682035605514>, but around 2PM EST is normally when I watch anime on the weekends
Awww yeah, Evangelion time!!!
"Boy, I'll watch Evangelion today at the same time as yesterday," I thought. Of course, inconvenience always seems to strike. <:MikuSigh:688429722799308883>
I cannot wait to watch more tomorrow!
Wow, those first 2 episodes were pretty good!
Doga Kobo if they made a bald girl

Bald girls <:HikariGalaxyBrain:659574651139260416>
I was a little surprised that the bald guy that took that one android didn't have a huge dome of light on him lmao
I noticed this watching Plastic Memories and Engaged to the Unidentified last year
Why tf does Doga Kobo hair have to be so shiny sometimes
I thought the CGI in Yuki Yuna looked dodgy too. At least on those small white vertex creatures that eat each other to form into a big one
What the hell? Why is an HBO Max original (Close Enough) **LEAVING** it?
<a:FlipFlapping:817946812509323275>
Happy birthday to these two goobers
<:FutabaSleep:639528295423016960>
Wow those do look nice
What a load of bullshit. This sucks.
Ohh
?
Streaming services were made to stop piracy for awhile and replace cable TV... now we're coming around full circle again.
Yeah this is such bullshit
Close Enough was also in development hell for years, so to see another of JG Quintel's shows get tossed around is fucking nuts
That's unbelievable tbh.
All these creators are getting their works trashed. So much will be lost to time
Why?
<:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206>
I sure will!
I love me a good cyberpunk series so I'll def give it a go
Ooh
(Totally not mentioning them specifically because they're all in Xenosaga)
Huh, when do I get around to Ghost, should I watch it subbed or dubbed? I usually stick with subbed for my first watch, but have read that the dub is surprisingly good. Hell, it even h as a few VAs I'm already familiar with, like Richard Epcar, Crispin Freeman, and Mary Elizabeth McGlynn to name a few
So this is up my alley
It's on my PTW. Generally speaking I love sci-fi action stuff
Watching a Ghost in the Shell clip and tbh I should really get to that one too
Ooh
She said she really wants to share the season they did manage to finish, and it looks like that would have dropped in 2023
I remember liking Summer Camp Island awhile ago and I read Julia Pott was not happy
It's so infuriating.
Wow. This is so fucked the more I read into it.
It's so dumb to see Disney can something because of that alone
That didn't stop Nick or Cartoon Network from having shows that dived into more mature themes and realized it brought in an older audience
Is such a weird reason to can a show
"It attracted an older audience"
I don't watch it but have heard it's a great one from Disney
Wait, what happened with Owl House?
I hope your career finds you well!
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Whoa!
Summer Camp Island was an HBO Max original? I remembered it airing on Cartoon Network before. Guess it got moved.
I can still remember when my older brother watched the final episode
Yep...
Clone Wars carried late 00s CN
Oh yeah true!
<:ShirabeWeep:701475635025019000>
Until Steven Universe came around
Idk why they treated him like shit when Regular Show and Adventure Time were *the* series to carry Cartoon Network in the early 2010s.
... Now it's gone.
Then it gets announced that it's on HBO Max.
... until that goes nowhere.
That one hurts the most imo. Regular Show spent half its life being tossed around by Cartoon Network. Then come to find out TBS is getting a new Regular Show but for adults.
Poor OK KO. That was a pretty fun one.
Ooh, next episode we finally get to meet Rei.
This entire episode has just been Shinji walking so far
POV: Watching the Konosuba movie
I started last weekend
I'm watching 2 a day on the weekends
3.
I wonder why some Evangelion episodes have one title but then an alternate one on the second half
Huh, and here I was thinking the Hedgehog Dilemma was something else!
Finally, an ED that encompasses the journey to your mom's house
Magia is a banger
Also hell yes
They were aiming for an OP that's meant to be generic but gets sadder as it goes on
Given the anime deceives at first, yeah
Yeah they look dope
Yooooooo
That's just devastating.
Because wow, did they ever make the basic package feel a lot more limited than it was
We only used it for a few days at most
And we got cable again after years of not having it
I remember it was... 2019?
We may as well have the tech to upload full series into our brains to watch at any time cuz my brain's on sci-fi shit
Netflix killed Blockbuster, streaming services are now killing Netflix. I can expect the collapse of streaming services in maybe 2 or 3 decades, give or take
(Corporation involved rainbow capitalism)
I hate rainbow capitalism, I hate rainbow capitalism
Well, going off Disney's line of thinking
If Hasbro saw that with MLP, they would've cancelled it on the spot probably
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
My discovery of JP was just messing around in video games and being like, "Wait, there's more languages than English to hear the characters in?"
Yeah.
Damn I vaguely remember that one
The idea of a balloon dummy of Unit 01 being used before any weapons is pretty funny
Shinji just got hit by that screaming triangle

Just a precaution to avoid burnout in my case
I'm doing 4 episodes a weekend, 2 on Saturday and Sunday
Boy, next weekend cannot come soon
üëÄ
Just googled it and people are making their own Pen¬≤ plushies. I. Want. One.
I loved all the tension, Shinji and Rei teaming up, and of course that ending scene
Yessss!
WOW! What an episode!
No. I have heard Strike is fun.
Haven't watched it, but it looks fun.
That's the new Shaft one, right?
Why so much axing

I love this little penguin for some reason
I'm in for a good episode seeing my boy Pen Pen on screen
I hear YuYuYu season 3 did a half assed job with adpating it
In terms of side content
I personally recommend reading NoWaYu at least
Don't mind me, just listening to her Fly Me to the Moon from this episode again cuz it's a banger
I LOVE HER
SHE'S SO PRETTY
Super excited to see what else happens
Oh yeah I bet. I've been doing 4 episodes per weekend, so I'll be watching the other 2 tomorrow
Also this screenshot lmao
I dig it
Asuka's Fly Me to the Moon is so good

MY HEART
HER SAYING GUTEN MORGUN
<:concerned:288512422912720896> Well, that's one way to start an episode
No way, someone made a limited edition Konosuba themed cake?
I was wondering what they'd do since the enemy can't react
This was a delightful watch btw
The ending bit with Pen Pen caught me off guard
Episode 9 and 10 were plenty fun
Episode 9: Defeat an angel with synchronized dancing
Episode 10: DeviantArt Asuka
||Gin's death in particular still hits me.||
Nvm, in just 2 minutes Pen Pen appears in episode 10. Perfection /j
Just finished episode 9. That was peak. I adored it.
Also the 62 second dance was so fun
I know that
Ahh yeah
Idk how to feel about Kaiji either. He seems really creepy for Misato.
The way Shinji backs away too. Ouch.
That was a moment. And Shinji moving in for the kiss on top of that
Asuka crying in her sleep... <:NotLikeMahiru:643203441799462912>
Pen Pen standing there makes it golden
I'm laughing at that montage rn
It's such a good one
This episode is gold
WHEEZE
THEN THE UNIT 02 ONE LMAO
Alright, this screencap is kinda funny
Getting to see 2 in battle where one isn't stationary like episode 6 will be great!
I didn't watch 2 episodes on Sunday so I'm going to compensate with 4 tomorrow maybe
Episode 9.
Are you telling me Asuka has never experienced a power outage before?
Evangelion takes place in 2015. Honestly this statement is shockingly accurate today.
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
And it's paired with one of my favorite post-movie SpongeBob episodes too
Did NOT expect them to pull out even bigger guns
Thank you. I'll sparsely post my thoughts there.
I shall
Holy shit, stickbug in Evangelion (not clickbait?!)
See, what'd I say?
"It would be disastrous if there were an angel attack right now."
**Knowing Eva, there might as well be!**
I kind of want to watch it again
God, what an episode
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AtUuaL4R1IM
I should watch this if only for those episodes
I'm laughing at the cruel angel's thesis lyrics being on screen and everything
This is hilarious
What the fuck
Oh wow
Amazing
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
I know it says "Character" but <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
What's Shinkalion doing there?!
Was looking at the AniList page for Evangelion and saw this
Yes, it absolutely is
It's probably the one piece of YuYuYu media I'd recommend
Most people say read the LN for Washio Sumi, I am one of those people
At least they have made half an Isekai title in one piece of dialogue
Like wtf were they thinking writing that
"My dear brother turns into an adult" is so funny to read
If only Nogi Wakaba didn't get an adaptation that was just "Hey here's the highlights"
Washio Sumi is great
R.I.P.

What, are we going to get a WALL-E sequel now featuring our favorite robot and Eve living in harmony on a reformed Earth?
I know capitalism plays a huge factor as to why a sequel exists, but really?
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
And I have a cat girl girlfriend that's the strongest mage sent to defeat the demon king!
Can't someone fall down the stairs "Ayo the pizza here" style?
Why's it always gotta be a truck?
<:Bruhchiko:679030205305585741>
Pardon?!
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
2 minutes in and already we have existential dread? New record?
SO TRUE
BUT WHAT ABOUT-
I vaguely remember Disney saying something along the lines of canning it? But it's coming back now so that's neat
One is on Nick, the other's on Disney for one. And Owl House has been treated rather poorly by comparison.
And most of the fic is copy/paste stuff from Wikia and other sources anyway. The word count actually broke FFN's word counter thing a long time ago
Idk if you're joking or not, but the longest fic actually is *Loud* House, not Owl
I remember hearing people want another season for awhile. It's not a show I've watched, but it's always nice to see it get a new season.
Walter White in Macross Plus? üëÄ
https://myanimelist.net/people/7940/Bryan_Cranston
Yes
Well, that's one way to pay off all your tax evasion I guess.
https://twitter.com/genshinmains/status/1570758490465116166?s=20&t=EajzEZv6PDLpZ0FssL8Qew
New Eva Unit in the air? Wrong! Angel!
I had to check if I was using Japanese audio at the start of episode 18 because there was people speaking English lol
Magical girl shows before 2011 (this is my last screenshot)
Ohhh true
Mr. Kaji works for Activision-Blizzard? üò≥
Shinji cleaning up the garbage on Rei's floor and her thanking him was so cute!
This episode of Eva: "I'm boutta end this man's whole career"
I've watched Tatami Galaxy, surely I can handle fast subtitles!
There was like 2 layers in the scene before with Shinji in the classroom
So. Many. Subtitles. In. This. Episode!
From another server I'm in:
That do unironically be one of the best fights in the series tho
<@441981795429384202> <@551256807041925148>
DRESS UP DARLING S2
YOOOO REAL SHIT?
Was that off screen sex scene really necessary?
That sure was an ending too.
WAIT WAIT WAIT HOLD THE GODDAMN PHONE
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
~~What's Atago doing there~~
I imagine all the Rebuild versions will be **a lot**
Holy. Shit.
<:NanaLay:705357764532371486>
Yep...
Also worried
Is it bad I'm excited to see more tomorrow?
That scene was metal as hell
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
Can I play among the stars in these good times?
I enjoy it when a show gets weird most of the time.
Can't wait for 19 and 20 tomorrow, then.
That ending...
Jesus tapdancing Christ on a bicycle over Saturn...
And both of those are anime that require another watch to figure out
I guess it helps I love stuff like Paranoia Agent and Lain that makes me feel Eva fits like a glove.
It's a great show I might as well add to my AniList favs.
Evangelion is one of those series I've had on my mind for awhile, and y'all do a lot to make me feel like I'm getting it as I'm watching.
Y'all have been great to share my thoughts with.
Been eating this series up and I can't wait to watch the movies.
Thinking this might be an 8/10? I'm gonna have to see. I haven't rated it yet on AniList but it might be a 9.
So I'm interested in the context with that one
All I know about 26 specifically is the goofy congratulations meme
But I could just go find em up on some pirate anime site. Who knows?
My parents unsubscribed from it months ago, so outta luck there.
Huh. Might have to see if there are any torrents for specifically those episodes.
So uh... <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Cuz I'm suuuuuper invested
But I will have to look up the director's cuts in that case
Looks like the torrent I have shows 21 (I just looked at the runtime to that one) is 23 minutes
23 and 24 the days after
Yep.
||Yeah that was NUTS. I remember Melua saying that's what the Berserker Bikki moment was alluding to in G, but in general I was awestruck by it. Then the episode after was an "Oh shit" moment.||
This moment just hits like a steel hammer
I'mma need that week before I hop back in, to say the least.
<:NanaLay:705357764532371486>
I watch 4 episodes a weekend. Up above I finished episode 20.
Evangelion will sure be a trip next weekend.
So uh... yeah.
My brain just can't flip from one series to another, it has to commit to one
Feels bad I haven't been watching Lycoris either since I've been so focused on the 4 episodes per weekend thing and watching through Eva
There's like a number of Trigger things I should watch
Speaking of Trigger, I did watch KLK a few months ago and loved it. I've considered maybe watching Panty & Stocking and Luluco
I've seen people meme on the "choom" slang
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Deus Ex is one of my favorite cyberpunk games for instance
Cyberpunk in general, especially cyberpunk dystopia, is my jam
I hear the dub is actually phenomenal
With how good I hear Edgerunners is, I'm willing to prob scoop up a dump on Nyaa and give that a watch.
Also idk if I'd want to go into Ghost in the Shell straight after I consume all the Evangelion content I want to, but I do like me a cyberpunk series with philosophical themes and a lot of action.
Oooooh
Ghost in the Shell is one I have wanted to give it a go. It and Stand Alone Complex.
But I know for certain that either way, I'll probably like it a lot
I'll keep my expectations in check going into EoE
But I'm sure EoE will blow my junk cube making robot movie out of the water
Damn, setting my expectations a little high there as someone whose favorite all time movie is Wall-E
If they let him pilot an Eva, they'd be toast.
He was too good, the Angels were too scared of him.
Awwwww
My favorite part of those scenes are the shenanigans Pen-Pen gets up to
<a:TakoJam:792028399915892757>
Gifs you can hear
Misato must've brought a lot of beer cans
üò≥
So yay for them not skipping out on those
That ofc means "Director's cut"
Pog
Good news: I looked at my EVA torrent that I've been watching through my phone and it shows "DC" next to Episode 21 and 23/24
It does end this Saturday iirc
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Huh. That means I'm 2 days away from more depressing robot anime antics
Wtf it's Thursday already?
Where's the treat?
Oh right that. And one of the sisters was bi rep
Him standing there during the synchronized attack montage is one of the funniest parts
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
The Evangelion content that matters /j
Yooooo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KoD3MY8WKaw
I remember liking Adventure Time, but I liked Regular Show a lot more with 2010s CN
Then it happened and I knew people that were like "I TOLD YOU"
I can still remember when people were theorizing about that
I still dunno when the movie's coming out, but I am hyped
Honestly should rewatch this and Madoka next year
The way things **tear** apart
My favorite part of that scene is when everything fires at once
Yeah
<:CagliostroPout:672861874471174166>
God, do I **have** to specify specific things?
I know. I was just saying she had one *type* of weapon compared to Homura having several different ones
Mami standing toe-to-toe with Homura is so cool. And Mami only has **one** gun!
The music, the animation, everything. It's all tightly wrapped in a package of one of the best anime movies I've watched.
I adore this scene so much
Watching this clip again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tVi_fs2oz3E
A shame
Huh, nothing for Madoka.
Consuming 4 episodes per weekend is really helpful overall since I feel less burnt out lol
I might just make it my next watch
There's also Ghost in the Shell and Stand Alone Complex on my list <:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
But I did tell you I wanted to watch it last year
Maybe I could start Shirobako finally, I know that one's 24 episodes
Oh that's good
Too bad most of my PTW is 20+ episode series. I do have stuff like Paprika and Perfect Blue on there
I just hope I don't spend the rest of my year watching Eva and can start at least get around to one or two more anime by the end of the year
Given how fucked up Episode 20 was, I'm afraid of what'll come next certainly.
Thanks! Didn't know that one.
Ohhhh
What is 25 (')?
But not after End
I'll ofc be watching the Rebuilds
You suggested I do that with Madoka when I first watched it last year before hopping into Rebellion, so EoE will certainly be the week after
That's my rule with finishing series that have movies.
Oh certainly.
I have the directors cuts of 21-24 to go through this weekend
Episode 20.
My weekend is gonna be some of the hardest hitting Eva episodes
Oh shit. One more day til suffering <:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
Mariah Carey isn't done defrosting yet
Smh Miku I thought you were smarter than your beloved Hibiki
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I was saying that directly to Hatsune Miku
I know
THAT TOO
How bad
Good art
Oh yeah her too
10 million different cliffhangers? C'mon Lily, ya sat through Symphogear. Surely you can sit through that too <:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Though I like FLOW already for their Naruto contributions and Berseria
Only thing I know about Code Geass is the OP being a banger for S1
Shirobako is next up. I know Melua's wanted me to watch that for awhile.
Just watch 25 and 26 that weekend.
Melua told me wait at least a week before End of Eva
That's exactly what I'm thinking
Oh yeah same
To think I'll be nearing the end of this series Sunday.
The poster child for amazingly traumatized anime women. Before Nana Mizuki decided to take up most of those roles.
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
I can't put into words how... Dark... That was.
What. An. Episode.
This in particular. Rei said very little, but still roasted her.
What a fucking moment
Oh my god. The scene.
That "Old hag" scene with Rei and Ritsuko's mom. Oh my god though.
Not much else aside a few memes
I do know about Asuka's mom because of memes, the get in the robot jokes, Komm Susser Tod, and uh...
There were a lot of moments.
Episode 21... Wow.
Seeing a younger Gendo was nice, especially seeing him do his sitting at a desk pose that you'd see throughout the series
Episode 21's highlights for me were getting to see Yui Ikari and a younger Gendo. Getting to just see the world pre-2015
Once it was put in the 7AM time slot, everyone knew it was over.
There was just something about seeing a thing you initially liked fizzle out and go with a whimper that hit me.
I remember wanting to watch Yuuki Yuuna S3 that year, too. But rewatching S1 took me months since I couldn't find the motivation.
Was something.
Seeing people's opinions change in real time from "Wow this is ambitious and good" to "Oh god oh fuck" to "Holy shit why did this end so badly"
I was a mod on the biggest Wonder Egg discord around the time it was gaining traction.
WEP burnt me out so hard I just stopped watching anime for months
Guess that tells me I should watch it soon. I was skeptical of it and waiting for it to end because after watching WEP last year, I was skeptical of airing anime originals.
Evangelion is just a pure classic and I really hope you watch it soon
Watch it for him.
https://tenor.com/view/pen-pen-my-beloved-eva-evangelion-heart-locket-gif-20937416
The good:

- You get to watch a mecha classic
- Deep story with interesting themes
- A different cover of Fly Me to the Moon every episode (Asuka's is my fav)
- PEN PEN THE COMEDIC RELIEF PENGUIN

The bad:

- I really can't think of anything but it is an 8/10 in my mind
Evangelion good
C'mon Hatsune, come watch Existential Crisis the Mecha anime with me
I haven't watched Geass but have seen people meme the Pizza Hut sponsorship
Sorry if I insulted you Kohinata
One will be Kohinata, the other will be Hatsune. Hopefully that settles that.
0 intelligence moment
With a text to speech voice
And seeing it fell apart deterred me from watching things as they air
Was the first proper anime I watched as it aired
WEP has a sad amount of nostalgia for me, despite it being out just last year
Was like watching a trainwreck in slow motion. Seeing the director hospitalized several times.
Remembering when WEPcord was reading all about the production troubles
Didn't get super far into it but I remember when I'd watch it late at night on TV
Saw Eureka 7 airing a few times on Adult Swim late at night in 2012 or 13 on Toonami?
Y'all are the best, I love watching through anime and hearing what y'all have to say
It's a really good anime
Thanks once again for helping me get through this series, Melua. Your contribution on its rocky development and talking about the angels really helped me get immersed more and recognize it as a must-watch.
That's next weekend!
That's so fuckin sad
Yeah...
This was the first person who told him he loved him.
I can imagine it's there because Shinji is hesitating.
Goddamn that's an ending alright
Did they run out of budget here like with the elevator?
When I see a mech by someone I'm reminded of Xenosaga 3 and the Yuriev fight
Wtf Kaworu just took Unit 02 and oh my god
True. The first half of the show was pretty solid from a fun Mecha action perspective and I think these later episodes are good, but they really would've benefited from trying to put these more towards the middle or something.
Yeah.
Given there's so many Rei clones, I can imagine one happened to be reformed to be Nagisa.
I wonder if Nagisa is the half of Rei that expresses feelings for Shinji.
Aww, poor Pen-Pen.
Very cryptic guy.
Idk how I feel about Nagisa. He's a very last minute character.
"Episode 23 was pretty messed up, I wonder how 24 will open- OHHH"
Now I'm on episode 24. Oh boy, next weekend will be something.
Evangelion mind fucks go from 0 to 100 to 110 to 115%
I... What...
The dummy plug things were...
**What the fuck**
That Eva graveyard is pretty unnerving.
Misato holding Ritsuko at gunpoint yeeeesh
I'd love to watch this episode uninterrupted but my little brother was being an annoying POS for a few so that's nice...
But wow was that a chaotic moment. God, I can't imagine the mess Shinji is rn
God I'm a fuckin idiot
I meant Rei
Memes aside holy SHIT
Asuka! Gender reveal parties won't be popular until 5 years later!
Knowing what we know about Shinji and Rei atm, I can see why Gendo prioritized rescuing her over Asuka. Which is pretty fucked up.
~~Confirmed: Rei likes Fanta~~
Rei's mind being a blank, orange void whereas Asuka's was that circle is interesting
Oh cool.
It even turns into a slim line like a giant worm
The angel in this episode is a floating halo. Huh, that's a new one.
Also just for the laughs I'll call this the Seca Jupiter
Shinji rocking that tape player is great
I love the amount of retro-futurism in this show
Oh yeah true
Evangelion has a timeline where the Saturn was successful enough for there to be a "mini" console of it in 2015 (headcanon)
Oh my fucking god
So I should watch them straightforward like this? 1.0 being a recap is interesting, but I imagine that's just to tweak a few elements.
Oooh
Wikipedia just gave me a straightforward 1.0, 2.0, 3.0., etc.
In this case, I was just looking up how many movies there were. Since I remember you  and others mentioning there being recap films.
I just get curious about specific things. It's not like I'm going to full on spoil myself with a little peeking.
And this is one of those times where I just look at the titles
I don't look any further than the titles sometimes
I know.
Sheeeeeeesh
I just think it'd be a nice idea to hold off on them since it'd be weird going from the end of one story to a series that remakes it
When I watch End of Evangelion (2 weeks), I think the next week will be starting Shirobako
From what I've seen Melua mention, yeah.
I like this other half of the series quite a bit. Though It's definitely a direction I didn't think it'd go. And that's coming from someone who's watching it with fresh eyes and minimal spoilers.
I'm still so amused by Evangelion starting off with fun action stuff and the formula consisting of Misato leading Rei, Shinji, and Asuka in combat with an Angel of the week. Then it drops this formula in favor of pretty heavy character writing
(No wait that's not what I'm meaning to say, I like Rei!)
Unit 02 toilet paper üò≥
What the hell? 4 planned movies?! Released in a year???
Sometimes it's for the better if an original stays resolved. Maybe release an OVA or 2.
Looking at what's in store for 2023, A1 certainly has quite a bit planned
(I really dislike the direction WEP went in to the point where it's inevitable for me to bring it up)
And more importantly, the fact that they didn't fumble it the way another original from last year did
Seeing an original do so well seems like a rarity nowadays.
I haven't watched it yet but that's nice
Looks like Lycoris is doing well in Japan
https://vxtwitter.com/quiethandfilms/status/1574454556968132608
üëÄ
I've watched content on it but I think for its time it's an impressive display of the Dreamcast hardware but nothing less.
True
https://www.eurogamer.net/shenmues-animated-series-has-been-cancelled
Seems to be something she gets type cast aside busty bombshells
I wonder how many other pink haired girls Yoko Hikasa has voiced by now
A shame 3Hz missed the mark pretty bad. They excel with original anime imo
I haven't watched Part-Timer but season 1 looked fun
I saw this face a lot
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/997206286221455453/1004984816971825223/unknown.png
I heard the second season wasn't great
Even Symphogear itself
Anime originals always seem to have endings that upset people for whatever reason
Does that continue into the rebuilds and EoE too?
Oooh.
Anno playing 4D chess sometimes
I do remember when I watched episode 20 and saw the scene with the Rei and Shinji baby names, it made my eyes widen remembering Rei syncing up with him all the way back in episode 9
I've a feeling this will be yet another series I can rewatch and see details for every watch
Holy shit
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
OHHHH
Oooh
If the Rei that died by the hands of Ritsuko's mom was cloned, is the one Rei we see- oh
I'm also scratching my head over some of the things from last weekend.
That's honestly funny
Oooh yeah I've seen that meme before
Oh yeah
God I also just realized how playing Xenosaga must have helped to strengthen why I like Eva
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Then the week after...
25 and 26 of Evangelion
Tomorrow is it. The homestretch.
Damn
So she was voicing characters that suffer ever since the days of Naruto and Nanoha
Yep!
Which is funny, since Orihime's dub voice, Stephanie Sheh, is Kyrie
I think Nero from DMC
YOOOOOOOOO
Lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kGMuaXIlckU
Someone sent this to me upon seeing I finished it
Clearly they haven't watched this episode closely.
It's funny to think Eva of all anime gave me an emotional support boost
As a person who does struggle with self worth I adore the message overall
That was great!
It's like this episode was designed to call out my own personal hangups
Is it bad "You're making yourself believe everyone hates you" makes me feel better?
Oh look it's the other thing!
Oh are they pulling Flip Flappers thing with the fake reality?
Holy shit one more episode
By the end of this episode is Shinji in his own weird escapist fantasy? Is that it?
Or, one friend and his mom
Out of context this looks like a mother taking her son to an uncanny wax museum that happens to have him and his friends there
These rapid fire questions. What is this? Is Shinji interviewing them for a spot at the McDonald's he's managing?
**What the fuck is going on**
Now suddenly Shinji is talking with Misato who's in a chair now
This is like a rapid fire mindfuck of assorted characters talking about themselves with a hint of something called the instrumentality of people
These episodes sure are a fan of tossing the title card in at almost or after the 10 minute mark
This entire episode so far has just been Rei roasting Shinji and Asuka, now I'm watching her ask who she is again
So uh... I reached that episode huh
Mobile discord made the mp4 thumbnail the jpg of the Rick Astley gif in <#336297387863703552>
This scene in particular struck a chord in me
But I'd def make a list of high/low priority stuff
I just have a PTW that isn't categorized at all
PFFFFFT WHAT
Should add it onto my PTW
Ooh
I love the way this is edited.
What I have read up on this promo is that it was on some Gunsmith Cats DVD? Huh.
Whoa this is cool!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pU11ttCUsK8
Someone made it upon looking it up
Oh wait that was a bobblehead
Also on an unrelated note I hope there's an IRL version of that Pen-Pen clock
But I acknowledge that yeah, it does stray off quite a bit from the mecha action later on, which is a dealbreaker for some
I personally like it as someone who likes psychological things and enjoys what Eva brings to the table with it
I personally find myself in the latter camp. It's got its issues, but I personally love it.
When I first watched Eva, I heard conflicting thoughts from people. Some saying it's a product of its time and not that good at all. Some saying it's one of the greatest.
Probably not gonna screenshot my way through it like the anime since I didn't do that with Revue's movie. The second time I start the movie up and just screenshot the important stuff
But you'll have to wait til next week
I'm interested!
Oooh
Pen Pen doing it got me laughing my ass off
But I will get to that next weekend
Not EoE yet
Yep
I can tell Spike Spencer had one hell of a time if that clip's anything to go by
I should watch the original dub sometime just for the laughs
I must have mixed something up then. But one of the discords I was in 2 years ago said it was good
Ohhhh
But they apparently rushed through parts of it
I heard the adaptation of that 2 years ago was good
Part of me wants to make sure I'm not spending too much time on a single anime. I started Evangelion on August 13th and finished today.
Maybe I'll keep 2.
Hm... Maybe thinking I should bump up 2 episodes a day to 4. Idk how good 8 episodes a weekend would be.
Though the weekend after I'll watch EoE Saturday so there might be a roadblock in my thoughts on Shirobako
Shirobako just got done! So tomorrow I'll be starting it!
Oooh
6.2GB torrent. Very nice!
Ahh nvm I found it!
Too bad when I go to look for it on Nyaa the movie comes up as the results
Nice!
Would it be a good idea to start Shirobako tomorrow (2 episodes) just so I can have something to watch to fill the gap in for that day?
Gridman's great
Last year
I watched Gridman
I was considering Shirobako next after I finish EoE
This is my current PTW
Did a huuuuuuuge zoom out just to grab everything

But I will definitely be keeping GGG
Hm... idk about Fafner on my PTW
Hard to think it went on for 11 years tho
Damn
Yoooo whaaaaa?
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Oh yeah. Now that makes a LOT of sense looking at her and her interactions after Asuka
Oh I feel that
Finished episode 1 of Shirobako. It's pretty good!
I'm not having to move the sides like I do to just get the full picture
Also the fact I went from a 4:3 anime to 16:9 is a little jarring since cropping screenshots isn't as bad
Just started Shirobako and I'm loving it off the bat.
YouTube oml
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>
Also is no one gonna talk about how the URL that Agent posted from the channel has "BAKA" at the end of it
Seeing Sakura and Chiyo fight Sasori again reminded me of how little Sakura was utilized
The Great Shinobi War arc lasted foreeeeeeeever
I remember watching it as a kid but not keeping up with it outside of the games and watching YouTube clips
But from the filler guide I used, apparently 141 and 142 have mixed canon/filler
Then after episode 100 there's like 6 episodes to dodge... then 107 - 135 you can watch. The rest is filler outside of the last few minutes of Episode 220
There were only a few pieces of it I noted. Mainly a clip show before the Chunin Exams, then there was one right after the big 3-way battle of the giant summons with Jiraiya, Tsunade, and Orochimaru.
Most of it is straightforward because in the 2002 anime most of the filler is easily avoidable.
I did like it, but you bet your ass I used that one website to see what I should skip to avoid any filler
I remember when I rewatched Naruto 2 years ago
N
Bleach is getting an adaptation of a manga arc since its anime got canned back in 2012. I forget why however.
With Boruto at least
Or were
Happy 20th to the first anime I got into for awhile. I know that shonen are considered "gateway" anime
Or, the anime
The 20th anniversary of Naruto was this year
Oh right
Happy 9 year anniversary to KLK
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
It's the 3rd today
https://twitter.com/DailyKLK/status/1576701780972355584
I remember when that was airing on Nicktoons Network
Sam just unlocked a dusty memory
Is season 2 going to be animated in Gary's Mod?
https://tenor.com/view/ex-arm-anime-gif-20044308
Yeah I just watched the first 2 episodes. Next weekend I'll continue after I watch End of Evangelion
?
WHAT
But yes I adore all the stuff they recreated
Chris was temporarily put in charge of YouTube for like a minute
I've heard about that one, mainly because of people who love Freyja but she's like all I know about it
Oooh!
What show is the one you took that screencap from?
Ooh.
And I know they ain't called Sunrise anymore so double whoops
<:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Didn't read the convo earlier, foolishly assumed it was something else
Ohhh
Sunrise hasn't paid me royalties for using my likeliness yet. Still waiting for that check in the mail
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Will there be farming in the movie?
Like stfu you larp as a Japanese nationalist from Grandma's basement in Detroit
Also lmao at the one person who tried saying they were forcing "Western politics" with a Twitter handle of "Admiral of Lolis"
<:DorothySip:464144450285731841>
Yeeeep
Most of the comments are either Yuri fans saying they're eating good, people calling it forced Yuri for some reason, or SAG-AFTRA related jabs
"SAG-AFTRA has a proposal like no other for you."
Most of the comments on Crunchyroll's Twitter are calling them out for the union thing
"Luffy hits someone so hard the original OP starts playing"
They love making these kinds of titles
700? You sure? A good chunk of that has to be filler.
Ikr? Dude seemed pretty important. Wonder why he didn't have one before.
Sasuke Retrieval Arc is one of the best parts of the series imo
The Sound 4 entirely got skipped. They probably wanted to mainly highlight all the Naruto vs. Sasuke related things, so skipping over Sound 4 was necessary to specifically highlight the Valley of the End fight
I wouldn't mind a cool clip show movie for Naruto if they remastered the scenes as shown here.
PV makes me question what this is. Since that stands for preview.
I'm so happy they made this
Looks like Aladdin
It's a me, a Ma-
Oh boy. End of Eva time.
Wait, watching on Friday means...
Considering maybe making Friday an anime watching day just as Saturday and Sunday are. Even if it means one less writing day. Watching 6 episodes across 3 days sounds pretty good!
Felt the same way with Sound Euphonium when I watched it. I liked Liz and the Blue Bird so much I wanted to give Sound a go... and only got like 3 or 4 episodes into it before dropping
Aww.
Wanted to watch it awhile ago but it fell off my PTW
I remember hearing it was a good one
I looooooooved this one during the last days of 2020.
Like Symphogear, this really is one I should rewatch
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-IcFDwygw-o
"It's a me, Ryuuko!"
Sounds like a lyric they'd slip into a Maria song sung in English that isn't Dark Oblivion
But it's sad that Boruto itself wasn't a one and done thing.
As a fan of Naruto I felt Boruto was a little unnecessary. Even as a fan of epilogue stories that show the characters I love all grown up. If we followed Naruto for 700 episodes, most of which were filler, why would I want to watch a descendant do the same? It sure has its novelty, getting to see old man Might Guy and all
Alright
Oooohhh
I've seen PV used for either

I knew someone else who got me to read the first few volumes and by god she's excited

There's the mobile game spinoff that expands on the anime by including the extra schools. But the extra schools were already introduced by the stage plays.
Yes
Ah wait it's just a promotional vid for the game I think. But a Relive anime would be interesting since they foreshadowed the other schools in the Revue Movie for those that don't play the gacha like me
Re:Live anime????
Wait wait wait

The Revue movie certainly feels designed to be a little confusing, but once things click? Wow do they click. And they really hurt.
My second watch isn't really a watch, it's more of a "Grab all the highlights"
When I watched the Revue movie I made a rule to not screenshot anything until after the film. Just watch it and let it all play out.
Tomorrow I'll be watching it, but I don't think I'll be screenshotting it like I did the anime.
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
I'm downloading End of Evangelion right now...
This sounds like it was made by The Prodigy
https://youtu.be/1cvv8nm1vSY
"This is my retribution. Forgive me, Shinji."
NO HANDS AREN'T MEANT TO GO AROUND NECKS
HOLY SHIT SHINJI
I just saw the "Pathetic." Thing that gets memed a lot
God I want to give Shinji all the head pats. This poor kid.
"Please don't leave me! Please care about me!"
Just have Shinji standing there holding her cross
Wow someone on the team really liked Misato getting intimate with Kaiji
Also yes the music here is brilliant! I love the vocals.
"The fate of mankind now lies in Ikari's hands"
**What the fuck is going on**
Jfc these scenes. Rei merging with Lilith, then the Eva series
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Rei just... Rose up from the ground and said "Fuck reuniting you with Yui, Shinji is calling me"
"Has third impact actually begun?"
Now Unit 01 is being crucified???
What was that scene with Rei and Gendo at the start <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Then it hit me with a "To be continued" followed by Anno thanking his staff for working on the film like an intermission.
Shinji's tortured screams as he sees Asuka being carried away. Wow.
By god. By god...
Her hand reaching out and then...
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
OH MY FUCKIN GOD NOW THE BEASTS ARE FEEDING ON ASUKA LIKE VULTURES
WHERE DID IT COME FROM
ASUKA JUST GOT PIERCED BY THE LANCE OF LONGINUS
Anyway holy shit
Is what it fuckin is
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
But oh well
You could say I wanted that to be a bit of something others figured out on their own
But I was just kinda focused on one character looking at it on AniList and remembered someone on another server bringing up Ayahi being in Maid War
Yeah I was gonna say
That scene's super good
I'm loving seeing Asuka rip and tear
Jfc this is nuts
It's deliberately knocking you out with them
By god this movie isn't pulling any punches
Then she died on top of it!
<:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Also "That was a grown up kiss. We'll do the rest later."
I was aware of that too since someone pointed it out yesterday
The "Nothing personal, kid." Scene where Misato saves Shinji from getting shot is top tier
Wow holy shit this is pretty good
But holy shit there was an anime OP worth of opening logos
I'll be sure to report back after watching, but I am liking this so far. It's a pretty interesting direction for an Eva movie
So uh... We're off to a start alright.
Shinji wanking off to unconscious Asuka, NERV having to deal with another breach of MAGI, now a bunch of armed commandos storming the base, leaving NERV no choice but to drag Shinji and the unconscious Asuka into the Evas
So I'm 12 minutes into End of Evangelion right now and there's been
No wait Rina is the voice of Eula
Rina Sato <:SakuraBless:592860091900887071>
Wait a minute you're telling me the voice of Velvet and Yelan is voicing a character here?
Someone on another discord I'm in said it was like if Quinten Tarantino got to make an anime
Interesting.
Whoa.
I had to look up Girlfriend of Steel out of curiosity
Oh my goodness
<:kanahana4:580703777011531792>
Reminds me of a mid-90s sci-fi game. Looks like something they'd put on the front cover or flex in a FMV cutscene
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
What the hell is that
Yeah that's valid
^
Idk what y'all think but I'm still trying to make sense of it all
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DuBOOcWIO2o
Someone sent me this video
Some of the lines at the end of the film make me think they're giving Shinji the tools to figure out and achieve his true happiness.
My brain's trying to connect the dots of EoE being tied to episodes 25 and 26, being before 25 and 26.
From another server I'm in
This is something I'll never forget.
The torrent I have had finnicky subs in that they'd disappear every so often but my god
So tomorrow I'll be continuing Shirobako. Maybe I'll grab my highlights for tonight.
<:MariaScared:672584661125431299>
There's some in the fridge I think
This was great. But sheeeeeesh
All I wanna say is my god
Asuka got the last line.
"The power of imagination is the ability to create your own future."
I'm wanting whatever psychedelics Anno was on
Unit 01 just popped out of the giant Rei eyeball
Cuz wow this ending is... Strange.
Is it safe to assume this is where the TV 25 and 26 come into play or?
"This is a world where we are all one."
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Surprise! Rei on top of Shinji!
I love this mindfuck
Ohhh wow
They've got a movie theater, people sitting inside it, lots of urban footage
Wonder what all the stock footage is from
Everyone is Sunny D now
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
**WOW**
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Would that be a support character of sorts?
Sounds cool!
I do recall you mentioning you made a tabletop Eva thing when I was asking about angel names
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
<:OhISee:663157855334957106>
Ahhhhhh
As in, because of the death threats he got annoyed enough to make a fucked up ending
Did Anno basically make EoE out of spite?
DVD menus in general used to be so cool
I remember liking the Star Wars Prequel DVD menus as a kid specifically since you'd start them up and they'd be in a different place whenever you'd start
Yes
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
The DVD menu questions your existence immediately
https://youtu.be/ay174Yvnx7s
Yeeeeeesh
Huh. Just got to see the End of Evangelion DVD menu. <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
That's Liz and the Blue Bird
But I plan on rewatching PriPri then binging the first 3 parts of Crown Handler
PriPri does have an ongoing series of films, which is probably why I've been holding off on it. Since I know Crown Handler is going to be released in parts like GuP
I put off rewatching PriPri for awhile because where I adore it, I enjoyed Flip Flappers a little better.
PriPri was good from what I remember. It's another "Should rewatch"
Yuuki Yuuna as a whole was that anime in between me actually watching Symphogear from start to finish I kind of enjoyed cuz it was magical girl and a bit of a deconstruction. And I have fond memories of going through it with my friends.
I did remove Washio Sumi is a Hero from my favs notably. Might re-evaluate my opinion on the Yuuki Yuuna franchise, who knows.
My favorite have are a bit dark with most of the entries
Ahhhh that was one of my favorite series from last year
Hey wait a minute, a new season of Molcar just dropped!
Plastic Memories <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Ooh nice. Super Cub I heard was really fun.
I really dunno.
This rewatch could bring me some newfound appreciation for things. Maybe GX won't be as bad as I thought it was during my first rewatch. And expose the cracks in AXZ I brushed over when I first watched it.
No screenshots however, given I already got them. Either way I'd want to at least give <#336310266654490624> my two cents on rewatching. Because I sure as hell was unable to not have the first time watch opportunity 2 years ago.
Symphogear I might binge, breaking my usual weekend rule. Because I haven't watched it in 2 years and it's the anime equivalent of comfort food for me oddly enough.
If they give a release date for the new Madoka movie I might make plans to rewatch it next year.
Funny. Tomorrow I'll be going from despair to cute girls doing anime stuff
<:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
It's one of the more memorable sequences in anything I've watched that just screenshotting it alone wouldn't do it justice
The Third Impact is one of those moments I think will be burned into my mind for a while.
I didn't get too much third impact stuff but I did get the Asuka putting her hand on Shinji's face thing and a few other things.
Grabbing screenshots (or perhaps just some of the important moments) and I couldn't resist getting this one
For me screenshots are a way to remember something. I categorize them by what series they are. If there's multiple seasons or a movie I make a separate folder for each
As in, as someone who screenshots their way through anime, I didn't even bother saving the few I had.
Then that optimism faded after I realized half of it was a recap and the other half was... Well... Unsatisfying.
Staff weren't super excited for it. I was somewhat optimistic like I always am...
Boy, do I ever remember the day that special aired.
Someone said that they had to work hard into overtime for the special episode, drawing a lot of frames in under 48 hours before the premiere
Remembered when I was a mod on WEPcord that a few foreign animators actually joined the server to discuss their work. In particular we had a few that brought up the grueling work schedule for the special.
I feel really bad for WEP on the production side.
WEP was produced during a pandemic, they were pretty understaffed since most were on season 2 of Promised Neverland, and the cursed production continued in spite of the director being hospitalized.
Limitless potential lies in anime originals. I think it's why I tend to have sympathy for most, even the ones that fell off tragically like Wonder Egg.
Oooh
Anime originals are the most interesting since you're not building off previous materials. So getting to see a creator's idea penned and animated is always nice, even if the execution varies.
I think my favorites may evolve over time. But for now Symphogear and FliFla taking the top spot is fine. I've a soft spot for most anime originals.
Liz was a good movie. A shame I didn't feel the same about Hibike
If they do an actual ReLive anime I'm gonna be excited
I heard someone on another server mention something called Nadia and also Gunbuster
Are there any other Anno works I should check out besides Eva?
Probably not because Maromi was designed to be a character that only the character designer lady could talk to. These are like an angel and devil in Aoi's mind.
I wonder if this references Paranoia Agent in any way
So yes I'll probably try 2 episode blocks, maybe 3 episodes if there's something big
I'm just super excited to watch this finally. It's proving to have been worth the wait.
Ty!
Oooh
2 episode blocks have been nice but yeah I'll try watching a few at a time if I see a cliffhanger
Like writing I'll have a vague description of just "Anime watching"
I'll try that out.
Thank you. Due to watching usually 4 (soon 6 next weekend) overall I imagine the extra 2 means I'll be ending on more nail-biting cliffhangers
I love Aoi lmao
Almost time for me to watch Shirobako more!
I love the editing
Alright, this is a cool AMV
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y2Yfju6lmOw
ReLive gives a decent amount of content to work with. I'm sure Kinema Citrus really could make a season or something for each school
Oh cool!
The way it flips EoE around with Unit 02 and Asuka over Unit 01. Huh?
Reading a summary of that Anima Eva thing and already it has... An interesting start.
I like the joyful look on her face
Noted. I was just bored and reading through the Eva wiki
Is it really a Kingdom Hearts thing if it isn't confusing?
So having something similar was definitely fascinating, since it has a few Geah elements in there, like them fighting eldritch abomination creatures.
I remember liking this 2 years ago since it was in that gap of me losing interest in Gear before picking it up again months later
But overall it depends. If you like Symphogear, you'll enjoy this as it's more magical girl stuff. But at the same time, it does come with its own set of gripes.
I think it's a decent enough series, Washio Sumi is a Hero in particular is one of my favorite things to come out of it
It'd be cool if XDU did the same thing, since I mean... mobile stuff in general shutting down kinda sucks, so having an offline version that just makes its way to consoles would be neat.
And just making it a VN
The Yuuki Yuuna mobile game shutdown means they're cutting the gacha part
https://twitter.com/entergram_info/status/1579064333841051648
The march of time is cruel
<:usedtoit:597805245879287830>
And I love getting to hear a story *from the actor* about the dubbing process
This video is golden
https://youtu.be/pyaYQTjZMek
And the only way it survives is through whatever got translated being thrown onto YouTube or other sites
It does really suck when a mobile game, especially gacha ones, get lost to time. Now I'm not a gacha person, but I moreso think it's bad for the stories and other things made for it just being tossed in the bin.
They said they were removing the gacha battle system afaik and just letting you play it in a VN style or something
Yeah
With a mobile exclusive thing getting shuttered, that's plenty of years worth of story content, assets, etc. going down the toilet
Not the games
I'm more talking about the stories
It really sucks we're in an era where these kinds of things get lost to time.
Yeah, I hope XDU does something similar.
Give me Crispin Freeman as Ver and I'll be sold
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
Ty, Blockio
I've been somewhat intrigued on that whole thing
Where can I read more into Evangelion's production btw?
Poor soul.
They were also saying "I'm gonna get it for my Xbox One"
"Wow, this one's gonna be groundbreaking I can feel it!"
Do I ever have memories of that summer work program I was part of in 2018 and seeing co-workers talk about Cyberpunk at Xbox's E3 that year
Oh good

Wonder how many lost animatics out there nowadays exist but couldn't be shown thanks to NDAs
It sure is!
Oh right <@263983345669505025> and <@246678192360783872>
Idk who else cares about KH but they found this lost animatic

Oh yeah I remember when I used to be involved in Western Animation how bad CB was
Ty
<:OhISee:663157855334957106> Cool!
Wait, when did XV use stock footage? I forget
You're fine. Madoka do be a good series though
I've already seen Madoka and Rebellion
I was talking about GGG
Oh interesting
Damn, what is that? I love good stop motion/claymation stuff
Will bump to 3 or 4 eventually
Normally that just means I'm planning on getting to it when I find the time to go from one anime to the next, given I have a schedule of watching anime on Fridays, Saturdays, and Sundays (Usually 2 episode intervals per day)
Soon‚Ñ¢Ô∏è
I have this on my PTW
Ah true
Looks like a Bakugan to me
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Ty, might read into this tonight
Oh cool!
Thinking about if this could've continued how goofy the censors would get
Or 24
The episode is *20 minutes* compared to the 22 it usually is
Shinji is just told "Go take a bath" and immediately teleports into the tub
PFFT THEY EDITED AROUND THE PEN-PEN BIT TOO
Ok I *had* to see the second episode just to see what got edited
**THEY REPLACED MISATO'S BEER WITH WATER**
Does bring me back a little since it has commercial breaks in between
Oh yeah the archive also has Episode 2 but I can't be arsed to watch past the opening few minutes
>Ritsuko's mom strangling young Rei is replaced by an edit where she's holding out her hands and extra dialogue saying "Aww you don't insult people like that it's not nice!"
Just imagining them making it to the director's cut episodes oml
IKR
Seeing Eva with a TV-Y7 FV rating is so trippy
https://archive.org/details/giant-robot-week-evangelion/Giant+Robot+Week+-+Evangelion+Ep+1.mp4
Not on Adult Swim, but on Toonami
Archive.org reminded me of the time Evangelion aired on Cartoon Network.
Hope she recovers
<:coconaWat:960956865490067507>
*Dwayne the Rock Johnson eyebrow raise gif*
That makes sense.
Oooh
What does make a horse hard to animate? Is it the legs and the general run cycle?
I've heard horses are super hard to animate so I'm amused with today's issue
Given they have the multiple schools to flesh out that are in the mobile game
Eh... it's more "Stage plays" than it is concerts afaik
And all 3 are great
Revue Starlight, Flip Flappers, Symphogear, 3 anime that really shaped me
Revue <:SakuraBless:592860091900887071>
Yeah, same VA
"The door's open" is forever ingrained into my memory
Should have heard Junna in the original dub then
Surprised with how this is turning out... pretty good after the original Revue dub was...

<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Yeah...
Oooh
Animals being animated is something I should look more into. That on its own sounds really fascinating.
Could imagine the process for drawing and moving the legs is rough because each frame that's 8 feet walking at once.
Ooh, good to know.
Not even an animator myself but I can see how laborious it'd be. Having to draw 8 legs and individually move each.
Animating spiders... Good lord.
Season 2 is airing next year, so you have a bit of time before the next season starts
Birdie Wing good
Aw nah what's Top Dad doing in Shirobako
It's cool jumping from an anime original in the first cour to seeing an adaptation and Aoi gain more responsibility with her now being in charge of an adaptation production
I love whatever this is called when a character just warps around at the thought of something
üëÄ
Melua describing them as Bleach people makes me visualize all 4 pics being poorly photoshopped Clorox in hoods
AniList just added this to their site, huh.
It makes scenes like Shadow being talked to near the end of the Last story even funnier
The SA2 retelling was funny because instead of Amy, Chris Thorndyke gets the role instead
It's not the best Sonic thing but it's really cool seeing someone license it
Sonic X? Holy shit
Wait what
Why not both.jpg
True.
Guessing the delay might be due to how successful GWitch is
Damn
Whaaaa?
Considering Ghost in the Shell after Shirobako cuz I've had an interest in watching the movies and Stand Alone Complex. As a person huge into cyberpunk I find it a disservice I've only peeped some clips
I know these things are supposed to be comedic relief so seeing them get *that* into something is great
It's so hilarious
(Because MOMO's episode 1 VA is one of several Tachikoma voices, Ziggy's VA is Batou)
My Xenosaga brainrot is so bad I can see MOMO and Ziggy having a conversation like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNY53tZ2geg
It looks so comfy
I should watch it
OOOOH
Idk what anime this is from but she's spitting facts
So true!
Me getting ready to defend AU Serena as secretly being Symphogear's best girl /j
I saw a gif where someone's hands split into these little fingers and were typing all over a keyboard and went, "Holy shit that's cool"
Love the visual style to it. The concrete jungle aesthetic and setting are cool!
Torrenting Ghost in the Shell rn. I've always wanted to watch it so I figured I'd grab the movie.
Contemplating if I should watch that or not, I am considering it.
Only have 4 more episodes left, I'm so excited!
Wow, Shirobako's been a treat so far.
Next weekend I'm watching Ghost in the Shell anyway. Gonna hold off on the movie as long as I can.
Yep.
Shirobako was so fuckin good
Can't believe the post-credits of Shirobako episode 24 had them make a reference saying Musani was going to potentially adapt a manga called...
Interesting to see them upload other versions of the OP, especially with ones that constantly evolve over time
Which is odd because some episodes don't do the cold open pre-OP thing and actually just start with it. What was stopping them from starting an episode without a cold open?
In Shirobako's case, it's a short frame from before the OP starts
Noticed on Crunchyroll's upload for some anime OP that sometimes at the start you get a brief clip from whatever episode it was in, which is odd
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NgY4-8IzP88
Also on the topic of Evangelion airing on Cartoon Network from a few weeks ago, there was actually to my surprise an airing of it on Adult Swim
What's even more coincidental is the video has a clip of Symphogear at the start when talking about "Battle anime" hyping Scryed up as one of the best
Saw a video talking about S-Cry-Ed and honestly looks up my alley
<:kanahana4:580703777011531792>
Two Piece
I love the vibe for this. Does a pretty decent job at hiding how serious it gets in its later half, showing the action upfront
Is it bad I miss this advertising style lol
Only a page in and this is pretty cute!
I've seen plenty of 'Choom" already from people mocking it lol
Yes. Watched my older brother play 2077 a bit and watched countless videos on 2077 as a game after the disastrous launch, looking into its development and stuff
Read on other servers the Netflix subs are goofed up
Kind of wanna watch it dubs since Trigger dubs turn out to be really good, was a huge fan of KLK even though I watched it subbed
But anyway, yeah I should watch Edgerunners, which I'll do soon anyway
Idk I've just seen so many Edgerunners memes on other servers that people can't be arsed to spoil tag
Mb
Ohhhh, true
I mean sure I'll still give it a shot later
I haven't seen it, though with how many memes I've seen about it I may as well not watch Edgerunners if stuff is gonna get spoiled like that <:kanahana4:580703777011531792>
With how recent Edgerunners is, wouldn't it have been advisable to spoil tag that?
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/press-release/2022-11-01/kadokawa-announces-acquisition-of-anime-news-network-media-business/.191434
Was a very solid time!
Watched Ghost in the Shell today
And that's one anime I see brought up a lot when people mention yuri stuff, though most people are mad about it being yuribait
True. I tried out Sound Euphonium after watching Liz and the Blue Bird and... didn't quite gel with it like I'd thought I would
But at the same time, I wanna watch shorter stuff. Heck, start things I wanted to get to like Lycoris and Edgerunners
Sure, Evangelion and Shirobako were worth the time I spent with them
Idk when I'll get around to it, since I have watched a few 20+ episode anime this year
Saw the OP to S.A.C. and a few clips
I mean Stand Alone Complex
I've considered peeping into Solid State Society
Batou and the Puppet Master were my favorite voices. Though Batou was voiced by Richard Epcar, who also voiced Ziggy in Xenosaga. So the moment I heard him I was like "Oh heck yeah"
Hear Stand Alone Complex is far better dubbed, and I can sure as hell see why since the 1995 one is eh... fine? I didn't mind it.
I also watched it dubbed, but I should go back and watch it subbed.
Ohhh, it's one of those situations where the creator of something bigger overshadows the actual creator?
I did love the philosophical themes of it
Neat!
<:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042>
Yes
Started reading Come Rain or Shine, which is a very cute yuri
The fact it even exists is still funny to me
Oh my god the Donkey Kong animated series
Like a certain other ponytail donning character from another anime I watched.
Now that I'm listening to it in Japanese, Togusa sure does sound... Familiar.
Just a philosophical conversation about how being a cyborg really could make you feel less human than you'd think.
The diving scene and conversation between the Major and Batou is maybe my favorite scene in the movie.
Ah, pardon. High velocity bullets.  But they're strong enough to go through car doors
AP rounds from a submachine gun no less!
Ghost in the Shell is so nuts
Cybernetics so good this guy can use AP rounds like this
Lol
The colors weren't off, turned out the TV brightness was set to "Brighter"
Saw Ghost in the Shell was free on Roku, decided to watch the first few minutes since it despite watching it yesterday to see how it looked. Idk if it's the 4K TV we have, but the colors were a bit off. This was the "25th anniversary edition" too
Watching a lot of analysis videos on Ghost in the Shell. One of those movies made for people like me where it has that perfect blend of action and philosophy.
Really enjoying Come Rain or Shine so far.
Wow, glad I got to watch Ghost in the Shell on my TV *before* the Roku channel removed it. Glad I've a torrent anyway.
Hidden underrated gem Symphogear
Plenty of potential for goofy merch
I'd buy a novelty Bocchi shirt that says "Social Anxiety Rocks!" Or something goofy like that
Hm... Could *maybe* livepost it since I have a blank spot open for anime rn. Just been reading Machikado and Come Rain or Shine
Yurikama?
It and Flip Flappers used to be on Crunchy
PriPri is a Studio 3Hz anime, thus it's probably on HiDive
Oh my god you're right
Spending almost the whole episode charging up a shot from their railguns or something
It's like that couch meme but with Irie
Only Cygames thing I've watched is Uma Musume, so I don't think I can comment much. Season 1 was pretty decent but 2 is shockingly fantastic
Ahhh
Healer Girl I did actually enjoy, tbh. It was a brain off cute musical and I couldn't have asked for nothing less.
They did do a guy focused idol anime though so I mean
Huh, interesting of 3Hz to pick something like that up
Ooh neat
Grew up watching Brave and the Bold myself, remember that one being pretty decent
Yooo Richard Epcar?
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
I make you feel old every time I say something
Wonder Egg was already going downhill after its first recap, the buildup to the finale was also people saying they weren't happy with the later half.
The finale discussion was *wild*
Staff themselves weren't fans of the series already, so it was like a "Let's just get this done and over with"
Wow
It was the worst because I was also a staff member of WEPcord when that finale aired and uhh
**HATE HATE HATE**
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
Obvious spoilers aside, what anime finale did you find so overwhelming it effected your opinion on the series overall?
Ooh, thanks! On mobile I'm loving MPV, been using it for the 2 years I've had my phone
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
So good to know VLC is good enough to stick with
Will stick to VLC on PC. Wasn't sure at first but MPV turned out to be less feature packed than the mobile one
Thanks y'all!
Is that one good enough?
But on my laptop where I have a lot of anime (normally I toss the stuff I watched on my phone onto it) I use VLC
On mobile I use MPV
What media player do y'all use on your computers?
<:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>
Love adding aesthetic to things you can say
Can I apply any plugins in MPV? When I watched Lain with VLC, I liked using a plugin called Phosphor to emulate a CRT TV feeling
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
YuYuYu is one of those series I think has potential, but is far held down by the fact you have so much side content that contributes to the whole.
Sorry if I sounded aggressive or anything, I was just curious if you'd watched Yuuki Yuuna yet. But I understand if you haven't since it is a bit of a mixed bag.
Well, forever is a bit of an exaggeration. But once you hit Nogi Wakaba it'll take a while thanks to it being a lengthy LN
I remember my initial watch 2 years ago took forever since I needed to read Nogi Wakaba and a few other things to understand smaller details in Hero Chapter.
The thought of there being an anime original season then having it followed by LNs is weird anyway. With Madoka afaik all the side material is just one-off stuff that's there if you really wanna read it. With Yuuki Yuuna, it becomes necessary in spots which can become frustrating.
Makes sense.
I was asking Melua
Did you watch it yet? I recall you asking about it
(It retold two light novels from what i heard, but I didn't read the other one)
Nogi Wakaba is a Hero is the one thing I highly recommend the most out of it, but it's a light novel and the anime's 3rd season was a meek retelling of it from what I heard.
WaSuYu is easily the best part of it in my eyes
Remember giving WaSuYu a 10/10 initially, but might bump it down a bit
Remembered liking it 2 years ago. It has its highlights but does have its issues I wish it could do better.
Oh right it's Fireboy <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
Genderswapped Lavaboy and Watergirl I see
Would have been funnier if it was since the studio behind this is Studio NUT
I've heard the human vocal cords scream before, but not full on glitch scream
Was that one show everyone shitposted about weekly
Gekidol Tuesday used to be a running joke on the Wonder Egg server
<#336297674707828747> is always free for you to spam art, just make sure it's a Twitter link or you have the picture and source so you can use 3_skip
Haven't watched Dyna yet, this may as well be an incentive
Rikka graduated from wide to **ULTRAWIDE**
<:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
YOOOO
Remember the anime ending on a very... "original" note since I heard the story went on
Had it on my radar when I finished the anime last year <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
Huh, couldn't have picked a better time to consider reading HnK then haha
Also Christmas is a holiday that should be capitalized smhsmh
chritsmas
The fact it's on YouTube for free is so cool
Np. D4DJ is really cool, I've been meaning to watch it myself but all I've seen are a few clips.
I was just saying
I know
Photon Maiden's cover of Synchrogazer is pretty good <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Well, D4DJ *does* have Millaarc's seiyuu in it, as well as Nana Mizuki. And they have covered two Symphogear OPs
I read the light novel but haven't read the manga adaptation
Nogi Wakaba is a Hero is that one side material I feel is worth the read
It's my second favorite thing to come out of the franchise
I think Washio Sumi is a Hero, after season 1, is well worth a watch.
There is the timeline of heroes which does kinda contribute to the story the anime only characters get to focus on
YuYuYu is far too ambitious for its own good.
YuYuYu killed itself the moment it decided to rely on a lot of side content.  Symphogear at least had the concert efforts and Nana Mizuki behind it to fuel the seasons.
I'm thinking that's a reference to the XDU event maybe? I wouldn't blame YuYuYu failing solely on Symphogear.
Who's ready to see Chris Pratt stomp... KOOPAS?
YO WHAT
OH NO
HAHAHAHA
I think it looks pretty good for CGI
I have a lot on my plate to watch thankfully
https://anilist.co/user/DasAntihero/
AniList sharing cuz why not
~~Peach says racial slurs now?!~~
Liz and the Blue Bird <:SakuraBless:592860091900887071>
Perhaps I should try watching the first
Oh. I forgot that Amazon Prime had the Rebuilds of Eva
Even calling back to the original visual...

~~What fountain of youth did Ash dip into and where can I find it~~
<:HibikiWow:738172615453048912>
Ash and Pikachu have been the faces of the anime for how long?
Wow
I haven't followed Pokemon stuff in years, so seeing this is...
https://vxtwitter.com/Pokemon_cojp/status/1603699397287903234/video/1
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/541487270944047104/1053280420776640593/319741995_518371400269365_5487267282571592498_n.png
So it's pretty surprising seeing them finally send Ash off after so long
I haven't watched the anime in God knows how long, I think back when it was on Cartoon Network
Ah, good catch
I wanna see old lady Jesse and James. Jesse is a crazy cat lady so she has a lot of Meowths
Though they are the biggest words
The first words that stuck out to me were "LESBIAN BROTHELS!"
#PussInBootsSweep
They're really pushing to get people into the franchise it seems
Oooh
Haven't watched HxH but hear 2011 is really good
https://twitter.com/hxhsource/status/1606124276926464006?s=46&t=gSGEMjesN6cx2y-S2MH2TQ
As long as it doesn't hit 10/10 and rattle the FMA:B fans
Way more than the main series
Urobuchi Symphogear would make Tsubasa go through several shredders
Damnit, Symphogear done by Trigger sounds cool tho
Can only think of one thing:

Xenosaga. The Toei adaptation sucked and I think it would be amazing if there could be an anime adaptation of Episode 2 and 3 along with a remake of Episode 1's poor adaptation
Chris during the chorus of Bye Bye Lullaby

Wow, Serena can really sing!
Idk I've never watched it but knew there was a heavy controversy surrounding it
I heard the original anime wasn't that good anyway
Idk why either
Yeah it's...
Oh boy, I know of a certain someone who's probably having a heart attack at the utter thought of this
https://twitter.com/animetv_jp/status/1610970144620118019?t=0IyiJz7qj2rV75IAvTfBpQ&s=19
I've heard good things about both
This is on my PTW, what would y'all say I should give a look?
~~Microsoft Excel game is making an anime OP? Wow~~
Edgerunners I've been meaning to peep at anyway
Dynazenon, Edgerunners, GGG. Hm...
Look I'm still trying to process that 2021 was now 2 years ago <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
(Correction: This was indeed early 2022)
LOOK AT THEIR EYES
LOOK
Because the eyes looked like tennis balls
Besides "I'm cute?" there was that one otome isekai thing from 2021 I remember people meming on
Vaguely remember Transformers Prime actually. That one was pretty neat
Then it became Discovery Family
"The Hub" Geeeeeeez I remember when it was called that
I'm excited to see this little gremlin
Hope it's as good as everyone says
üôè
Downloading that Lycoris Recoil anime rn
**Oh my god**
God I loved Shirobako. Maybe I'll try Girlish Number
Yeah
I hadn't watched that one
Ohhhh
You could even dive into the subject of people suffering to make the game possible, i.e. having to look up grotesque images to make something look more realistic like with the Calisto Protocol
If Shirobako was about how rough the anime industry is, imagine how good a video game one would've been
Studio Alice in Chains??? /j
I gotta watch that too
Oh yeah Bocc the Rocc
Really eager to also watch Akiba Maid War since I remember liking the one clip I saw of it
That first episode was so good
LOOK AT HER
She just like me fr
Welp, here's one I'm excited for.
I mean Homura oops
I certainly was a little mixed with Takina at first. Normally when I see a black haired, stoic girl I think "Oh here comes the Mami expy"
Ngl at first I wasn't too certain. Sure the action was cool and the characters seemed good, but I feel once I hit episode 3 things are beginning to get engaging.
But this series is pretty damn good
I'll keep things on low of course
Those post credits üëÄ
Ain't media control great?
Also hooray for convenient media cover stories. Nooo, there wasn't an explosion, the train just derailed itself! No one was harmed, we promise!
Close to the end of the episode. Whoever this green haired guy is, I kinda like him the way I like Albedo in Xenosaga. Idk, I just have a thing for extremely evil sadistic antagonists
I've seen the "SAKANAAAAA" clip everywhere now seeing it in its context it's like "Oh yeah that part"
"Is it an aqua- of course it's an aquarium."
My favorite part of it is generally Chisato doing anything. The slow motion, her casually swerving around bullets
3 episodes into Lycoris and it's pretty good, fun, and gay
Casting Hastega, then Slowga? Smh
No Sonic brainrot don't do it
Details that don't add to the product as a whole but are nice to have anyway
It's the small, insignificant things I tend to admire the most.
On the sound design front, I liked when Chisato hit Takina's backpack and you could hear the guns inside rattle around
It's a small touch but Lycoris is full of some fun sound design and visual bits
As an action lover who does like seeing things get bloody, I also appreciate the little clouds of blood that spray when she fires the non-lethal bullets
*God* it's so fun!
Watched this clip again
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLZ-h69lDm8
Still, LycoReco's timing was sure something
Ahhhh
Iirc didn't they delay airing an episode because of this?
Lycoris has had pretty solid writing so far. I also find it funny this aired around the time Shinzo Abe got shot, that certainly was quite the timing
But I like the angle of (episode 4 spoilers) ||Takina being so used to her child soldier duties that Chisato begins to bring a side of her out that certainly wasn't there before.||
After seeing this memed on so many times, it's really funny seeing the original thing
The Tachibana lineage carries the charm point down from generation to generation
<:kanahana4:580703777011531792>
"Woke" is a code word for "Something I don't like" looking at right wing logic
And not only from the angle of "This changed the character designs and ruined the characterization so it sucks" but knowing **the creator** sucks too
Hey, at least we know now that the show *really is* a shitfest
<:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>
Good to know this series' biggest crime now isn't being an unfunny, unoriginal mess
God, at first I was like "This would be something right wing channels will mock for being woke" but nah
<:HaloDisgust:859740618484613120>
I wonder if this was another case of someone wanting to make an original IP, but realizing it wouldn't get anywhere without being named after a popular property
I hope Cr1tikal can make it through at least a few episodes so I can see him trash it
(Idk I haven't watched it yet but I have watched Moral Orel and Adult Swim at the time said it was too depressing by season 3)
Bojack just *barely* scraped by from what I read since it was gonna get canned several times
Can't have em be too heavy or they get cancelled, look at Moral Orel and Bojack Horseman
"Adult" animation, people...
FromSoft should've cut that from the main game smh
That was the wooooooorst

Can't wait til the Chosen Undead vs. Ornstein and Smough fight gets adapted! Anor Londo arc is gonna be wild
Hey! You can't have a kid sit up front! That's illegal!
I'm watching LycoReco for the first time and I'm very impressed
Who bets most of the view count is from hatewatching?
Still disappointed out of all the characters they could've added, they did not add Neo
In her autobiography she says one of the T-slurs
Yes, right here.
Crunchyroll as a company isn't all that good, so we've all agreed on.
Very true
Generally stiff, boring "adult" animation that tries to sell itself as a new, raunchy Scooby Doo without Scoob... while falling completely flat due to it being unfunny.
HGS is that kind of thing that doesn't do anything special and is only "Controversial" by alt-right dweebs.
HGS' creator wasn't transphobic. I can't even compare Velma to HGS because where HGS is at least alright, Velma is an excusable shitfest
But god when I'm laughing at Konosuba, you know you've fucked up.
Its creator is already transphobic as Ten and Voy pointed out earlier
If this is considered adult animation, it should have 50 million question marks around it
Ahhhh.
Ohhh boy
<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> No *you're* the best!

Imagine how many retakes that took, having to read and say that out loud
KFC parfait üò≥
Without diving into spoilers I'll say it was really good! One issue I do have is I felt that the final 3 episodes could have been a little better, but it wraps up neatly so I'm not complaining
Just finished Lycoris Recoil!
(Because smoking one of these flowers IRL would be deadly)
Oh hey it appears my torrent has the eyecatchers that had to be changed
It's socially anxious rock band time

Wanting to watch Bocchi the Rock, but an old anime by the name of S-Cry-Ed has caught my eye
> It is possible for frangible bullets to go through car doors, and it's not as ridiculous as "armor-piercing non-lethal rubber bullets" might sound at first. A car door isn't armor, and the bullets aren't quite rubber either.
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>
How are Chisato's rubber bullets able to pierce through a car door?
Rewatching a clip from LycoReco episode 1 and uh...
LMAO YEAH HERE IT IS
Wait, I think I have the orb pondering one saved on my phone
Starting from the beginning of the series. Oh lord I remember seeing memes of that lol
Started reading Houseki no Kuni, because if Orange ain't giving us a season 2 why not start reading

When did Bandai-Namco make this Tales game?
Not even
Which is still a shred of whatever Phos goes through
Forget being a rock I'd rather be a tree inst- wait nevermind I'd be cut down and turned into paper
If Phos is considered young at 300, what's that make me?
How does something that big go unpublished?
What the fuck?
But I should watch the GLT anime beforehand
Ah right, I have only these two
... My plan to read is not that plentiful, I normally just toss whatever I hear is alright up there.
HnK has been in my sights for awhile cuz I don't read a lot of manga but was generally interested in giving it a read considering I liked the anime and it was on my plan to read for a long time.
Uhm actually I was born in the autumn ü§ì /j
(Well, onto chapter 21 so eh... still early in)
Shoot, I can't view those yet. I'm only up to chapter 20-ish
I never considered *that* when getting into it outside of hearing it's a lot of suffering
That sounds... daunting now.
**Oh lord**
Are we talking End of Evangelion levels of depressing?
"I'm gonna read the manga because Orange hasn't made a second season yet and I'm wondering what kinda whacky suffering hijinks Phos is in for next." - Famous last words of a madman/woman
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611> So I've heard
When I eventually do catch up, I'll just be another person waiting in line
Oh true.
8 panels per page with lots of text made my brain melt
I recall the last time I tried reading a manga, it was Machikado Mazoku. Where I greatly enjoyed that, the 4koma style definitely felt overwhelming after a bit, especially with how they were scanned so it was like one page separated between 4 panels of text. Got pretty tiresome to follow along with.
Guess it's partly due to how it doesn't have too much text and I can stay pretty focused. Sure characters talk and all, but it's not like a lot of text boxes popping up at once
While reading Land of the Lustrous I'm surprised at how fast this manga seems to be going. Usually I spend a decent amount of time when I'm reading but it feels like I'm knocking out chapters of this in a few minutes.
And Arknights has doctah
Yeah wtf are they gonna do for the self-insert character? At least Genshin, while it's getting an anime, has Lumine and Aether
Ok, I stand corrected it seems.

Not super surprised by this either, but I heard on launch that Blue Archive didn't really have that much of a story
https://twitter.com/Blue_ArchiveJP/status/1617090009261309952
Shaft was busy with Monogatari it'd seem
How many ideas do you think they went through with the 4th movie? With over a decade of thinking on it, there has to be hundreds of ideas by now.
Shaft has only had 3 anime productions in 2022, so I wonder if maybe 2023 will be a year we get more info? We'll have to see.
I first watched Madoka the month after the announcement, then Rebellion a week after I finished the anime.
Wonder how that's coming along.
Hey, good timing since Madoka movie 4 was announced... 2 years ago now?
||Really going to rock my world?||
On top of that LOTL is so solidly paced with its pages that you never feel overwhelmed. Seeing 20 or 30 page chapters may seem daunting at first, but it uses those pages pretty well.
I loved seeing things animated but reading the manga I was like "Oh ok this is really cool"

Loved the anime but that was but a scratch on the surface
This manga is NUTS
I never expected myself to get sad over rocks but goodness gracious

I'm probably gonna try going to sleep and finishing that volume tomorrow, but I was so into reading it that I didn't even realize Tachiyomi shifted from volume 5 to 6
||YEAH! I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, SO SAD HE GOT TAKEN AWAY SO QUICK LIKE THAT||
(Land of the Lustrous Volume 5 and the start of 6) ||So I read through this and the first 2 chapters of volume 6 and things are NUTS. Ghost Quartz is a hell of an interesting character, but I'm pretty interested in the Lunarian and Sensei connection. My favorite scene of these chapters was the ending of chapter 37. That ending panel with the dismembered bits of Phos as the Lunarians carry away pieces of Ghost... Good god.||

Yes. I don't watch anime too often, given my hobby is more gaming, but I was pretty eager to give it a watch since I thought it looked fun and comfy
CUTE!
One of the most fun details about the end of each episode is the next episode title being previewed on a poster like it's a live band playing each week

There's something about anime that have those messages that aren't really subtle that I enjoy
Same. I love things like Lain and other anime that use metaphors and unusual imagery to convey a message
Revue in general is something I adore, but I can see where the idea of it being overrated comes from
Her Nana cosplay goes pretty hard tbh
Is that a giant cross?!
Aw cool, Tachiyomi has stats now
Volume 8 and 9 have been so balls to the wall insane. If Orange ever makes a second season, **holy shit** they're gonna have a lot on their hands

Down to nailing Adam Jones guitar tone to a T.
This channel covered every album they did up to the release of Fear Inoculum and imo it's some of the best guitar work I've seen on YouTube.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ag-BXeXLcA
Bass specifically gets the most work in Disposition and Reflection. Guitar is really heavy in Triad.
Seeing someone perform for the whole 22 minutes amazes me. Guitar work in general is insane for all these songs.

On a side note, we should move to <#337805317276565525>
Generally speaking I enjoy all eras of Sonic since I find some games enjoyable from each era, but I'm really rooted in the Adventure era.
My other favorite aside Ratchet, Crash, Rayman, etc. is probably Sonic.
Atm since my PS2 games and all are in storage, I've gone from playing Ratchet on PS2 to emulators since I have a good enough PC for it.
2 I need to actually give a full play myself. Played the first bit of it a few times and honestly need to finish.
Rayman 3 is my jam tbh
Heck yeah we're on the same levels
<:MariaBliss:688836867390439585>
Jak came a little later on. I stll play my PS2 to this day.
I only grew up with Ratchet and the first Sly.
Same!
This might just be it though.
Hard for me to choose a favorite from this game's soundtrack. Where it's my favorite in the series, there's so many good tracks that it's hard to choose just one.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P1DG9M-V_JY
DMC3's soundtrack's one of my favorites.
<:TsubasaBliss:672861879000891432>

Same. The PS2 title screens were really good.
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I recall reading Sony was jealous of Crash pushing the PS1 hardware to the limits that they tried making their own game, but they had no idea how ND did any of the things for Crash.
That's why HD ports of both Jak and Ratchet suffer dependent on the game, given the techniques at use.
Insomniac was well known for working closely with Naughty Dog, the latter using leaps and bounds to make their games run and push the PS2 to their limits as well.
Even really good PCs like mine have a few moments where it chugs.
All the Ratchet games on PS2 are really hard to emulate in reality.

Abe's a floor waxer for RuptureFarms, and one night sneaks in on a meeting with the higher ups. They say production for scrab cakes and paramite pies are down, so they decide to turn to the workers for food next. With nothing on his side except wit, the ability to possess things, and agility, Abe sets out to save his fellow employees and explore the world outside of RuptureFarms where he finds out his kind is more than just enslaved employees.
He works in this meat packing factory and each employee's lips are stitched up as to prevent workers from talking to one another. That aside, they've been packing and selling meat of all the animals in RuptureFarm's vicinity.
The story to the Oddworld series is genuinely one of my favorites. Abe is an employee that works on this alien planet named... well... Oddworld.
I love that ad.
An enslaved creature trying to save his own race from becoming food and J-Pop most definitely mix.
https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=oPvegHle8K4
Reminds me of how Oddworld in Japan was marketed like this.
Can't believe I haven't listened to this before.

Dante's second fight is kind of a pain until you learn the magic of him not being able to royal guard grabs, so that phase when he's walking up to you is way easier.

But I imagine Tails stages being what they are was only done since, when compared to Eggman, Tails isn't as experienced with inventing things. Eggman is, pardon the pun, a really hard boiled inventor and tactician given his run-ins with Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles over the course of the series. And given how both Adventure games followed Tails having his own arc of Tails trying to gain independence, it makes sense his stages are more of a challenge than a stomp through things and decimating the entirety of the world around him.
Peak mech stage design, too. It really is a shame that Tails didn't get a level anything like this. Imo if they remade SA2, I would LOVE to see Tails get a stage overhaul so they can be just as awesome as Eggman's.
*This* is my favorite Eggman theme

I'd argue he's probably the best voice of the 90s, as iconic as Kurt Cobain, Eddie Vedder, and Layne Staley are.

Well, 46 & 2 *does* get segued into by useful idiot. So the other segues are just kinda there.
The segues are great, but they're just segues. None of them are really relevant to the song except intermission.
I could go in-depth on how much I love each track on this album (except the segues)
It's just a brutal SLAM

Kind of an interesting detail, since it implies that the pearl currency being hard to come by means they don't get too much business, so you're pretty much a really valued customer in their eyes by finding this obscure currency.

Where its gameplay is pretty eh since it's a lot more story focused, I absolutely love Planescape regardless. Best means of playing it is specifically INT/WIS/CHA since the game is far more about dialogue than combat.
Then just at the beginning of this year, after buying it from the Steam Xmas sale, I managed to complete it in a few weeks.
2 years of starting a save, getting to a certain point, then losing interest
It took me several years before I actually completed the final dungeon

Undertow is an album that while not up to √Ünima or Lateralus in terms of Tool being Tool, it still goes absolutely lethal with its subject matters.
It describes a state of mind I once had and sometimes still think about. Describing a person who's own decisions keep causing life to crumble around them, that even the things they used to enjoy no longer give them the high it once gave off. The water being a metaphor of their depression sinking themselves further in. Undertow as an album is themed around water. Be it that bong rip that sounds like an oxygen tank being ripped from a scuba diver's backpack, or how Undertow is about drug addiction, but its lyrics describe it as drowning.
Where Undertow is far from my favorite album, Flood is my favorite Tool song.

Doesn't stop me from trying to mess with the physics and get myself clipped through shit
I've been playing it again with the Dreamcast mod and all on PC, and from what I hear that patches up some of those things.
It's a lot more polished than Adventure 1, but you can still glitch it out.
As much as I love the game, Sky Rail is one of the biggest examples of "This needed a bit more time"
True
Tbh I think all of Shadow's levels vary. White Jungle and Radical Highway are great, Final Rush is fun albeit challenging, then there's Sky Rail. Which is 50/50

Ik they were split on the album, but it was a lot less jarring to hear it on your CD/Spotify with gapless playback compared to YouTube

The best part of the game if only for how well written and designed it was.

... Though I think the multiplayer part is just a bit of personal bias since I have a lot of nostalgia tied towards the multiplayer.
I think NightFire's singleplayer holds up mostly well. Save for a few of the vehicle levels, I like the on-foot stuff. And the multiplayer potentially rivals GoldenEye in spots for me.
Objectives are annoying af at times. You miss one and have to redo the whole mission...
I played it for a bit and thought it wasn't half bad, but it's moreso nostalgia that'd make it hold up more.
^
That last mission was absolutely hard.
I wanna replay it sometime, but I remember finishing it once in 2018 after I never finished it as a kid.
EoN is goated yeah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AJO8uo3UMko
Grew up playing it on GameCube though
Started replaying it recently after seeing it's playable on an OG Xbox emulator (I know Dolphin and PCSX2 can also play it as well, just was curious enough to try the Xbox version)
I think NightFire is still one of the best 007 games though
Since I never finished that one either, but liked the gameplay
I should also get around to playing more Perfect Dark
I remember playing it with mouselook through that one N64 emulator years ago
Still need to get around to finishing that game
Can be forgettable at times, though I enjoy when things kick in. Around the 2 minute mark the buildup becomes worth it since this track kicks ass.
Where GoldenEye Rogue Agent isn't that good of a game, I do like the music.

I was actually around the part after SHODAN leads you into the office and tells you to go find these components
Speaking of SS2, I should *really* finish it
With the music off, I feel you aren't as nervous or on edge to get that ship disabled as the intense techno kicks up.
The track at the beginning adds a lot of tension. The spaceship you're on is exploding, you gotta find a way to prevent it!
A lot of people oddly enough say to play with the music off. But I really like the soundtrack since it knows when to be moody and tense, or when to just be fast paced enough to get you on the edge

But overall, it's a lot weaker than their prior albums. If you're wanting to listen to this band, I highly encourage giving √Ünima and Lateralus a listen. I like Undertow's heaviness, but YMMV with it and 10,000 Days.
10,000 Days is an album I already place lower than the others. Fear Inoculum manages to combine pretty much most of the elements from their prior albums into this one, and it mostly works. 7empest and the title track are easily my favorite two tracks.
Over the years my opinion towards this album's always been about the same. Where it is good, it's just not as memorable as their prior outings.
I listened to Fear Inoculum, the latest Tool album.
Layne Staley was taken away from us too soon. <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1vOnTDTw7sU
Sickman, Would, and Down in a Hole are my other favorites
My favorite song off Dirt. It's such a dark, dreary look into Layne's mindset. The whole album is dreary and dark, but this track takes the cake for being a look into the junkie community (hence the name)

The entire album is about this "antagonist", the album's title, being the embodiment of being controlled by impulse. The fear of your own actions being ran not by your own thoughts, but by acting without thought.
The outro is bittersweet because if given a chance to re-do life, the protagonist wouldn't do it. Instead, they'd live life as is. Just make better choices.
Hurt is a terrific album closer that, with the context of the rest of album, feels so eerily human.
But the ending feels a little "bittersweet"
Yes.
The Downward Spiral, as a full album, is some of the most soul-shatteringly human things I've listened to. 65 minutes of pure, loud, and destructive madness that culminates in a depressing end. There's plenty of heavy and rough subject matters going in, so just make sure you're prepared. This is a 10/10 that I think might go above Tool's √Ünima as one of my favorite albums.
This album is so dark. So real. I love it.
I've listened to parts of this album a concerning number of times.

Legend of Spyro had a very nice soundtrack for all 3 games. It's such a shame that they aren't too much to write home about, though. Dawn of the Dragon was at least fun. Though I happen to feel bad for Krome Studios since you can really tell they weren't given enough budget.

Nirvana wanted to make In Utero sound raw since Nevermind was so commercialized.
This album is easily one of my favorites from the grunge era. It was raw and very experimental.

Red Hot Chili Peppers is my other fav example of bass heavy bands
Primus stands out the most for its use of bass. Their use of it is just too damn good, and I'm glad that other bands have caught on trying to use it.
No matter what song I listen to from this band, I always find the bass work impressive

Aside it being a late night show, I'm a little surprised they got away with even saying God's name since I know some stations actually censor it. You can't even say 'God damnit" on a TV show without God being bleeped out
"Fuck your God!' is changed to "Thank your God!"

This cover is absolutely great.
I think it's neat having heard the original. Justin Chancellor was in a band named Peach prior to joining Tool, then when Paul D'Amour left due to creative differences, they brought Justin onboard.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmkRHo4Vca4
Opiate was an EP with about some of the heaviest Tool stuff heard. Then Undertow came out and that album was them finding their sound. √Ünima is my favorite of theirs, being heavy but also having some of the best prog tracks heard. Lateralus then followed it up and it's just as good. 10,000 Days is alright, and I'm still indifferent about Fear Inoculum.
This upload itself is pretty alright. Opiate is a pre-Lateralus/10,000 Days EP so to hear it done in that style is a bit unusual.
Opiate is turning 30 on March 10th so it makes sense
New, re-recorded Tool just dropped?
What the fuck?

YO WTF
The song he's singing in this video, one of the band's most famous, is about his descent into drug addiction.
STP's discography had plenty of drug use references, with Purple and Tiny Music hinting at his addiction.
Given he'd died months after this happened, you could really start to see the effects drugs were having on him.
God, this video is a little hard to watch.

Heart Shaped Box and Dumb are classics, so is All Apologies.
While yes, Nevermind is a classic album, I think what makes In Utero great is how its production was meant to be raw. Lyrically and instrumentally, it's also one of my favorite albums. Milk It and Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle remain my favorite tracks, though everything else rocks.
Listening to Nirvana's In Utero again made me really appreciate the album more.

I know on CD they're individual tracks, but there's a difference between CD players and YouTube uploads.
Having Parabol wait a few seconds before Parabola plays kills how dope the transition is, and only the music video offers the seamless transition
Wish YouTube had something like gapless playback for music specifically since it'd really help with this album and Lateralus
Some songs on this album actually *rely* on a transitionary track, i.e. Useful Idiot -> 46&2
A shame both songs aren't just thrown into one video

God, Gex 2's soundtrack is still one of my faves
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1eAdQKDMEcc
Aw cool, they did a performance of this song for their in-quarantine thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=35dUD9p2PGA
You're not really missing much with the song, but imo the rest of the album is worth it. With classic songs like Sober, and absolute bangers with Swamp Song and Flood.
It features, among other things:

- A preacher at the start
- A song after the long start
- Crickets chirping (makes up a majority of the 15 minutes)
- A recording of some message left by Maynard's landlord
Hell, the original CD version made Disgustipated a "hidden track" of sorts. On the CD, it was track 69. Tracks 10 - 68 were just one or two seconds of null audio.
This is a prog band we're talking about, with songs that normally go into the 7-8 minute territory.
A vinyl can only hold 40 minutes, so it makes sense they couldn't fit it all on one side
Disgustipated is so big that the 1996 reissue gave it a side all to itself
Interestingly enough to me, I've looked at discogs' LP releases for Tool's Undertow, and it looked like the original 1993 LP version didn't have Disgustipated
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XIFUHzCUHrg
I love how that entire episode is a ludicrous homage to Mecha down to an insert song
Heard that new album that released April 1st is really good

Unless you're me who completely shredded the final boss with the RYNO V <:MikuLaugh:688429715676987428>
This is easily the best part of the soundtrack, adding to the emotional stakes
Where the OST is pretty forgettable, a shame since the PS2 era composer left after Quest for Booty

Californication was notable for audio clipping throughout the album
Rick Rubin is known for his butchering of audio in some areas
Iirc there was a bit of "Loudness war" going on

Still in pretty active development. I hear they're working on a VR version of SS2 as well
But I don't mind stuff like System Shock 2 cuz of the atmosphere
I've a heart condition so spooky games are usually a no go if I am warned of jumpscares and stuff
It was already scary off the bat.
But I remember it's one of those few games that didn't need jumpscares or anything to terrify me
Albeit I didn't play it as a kid
I should finish it, but same.

i.e. the title of the game panning back and the characters in that art appearing
Sometimes I peep at the video itself, and I find it interesting they're most of the times more than just a static image of the game
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6W1xkeufQTo
Idk what it is about the 90s era of music in general and why I like it so much, but damn is Alice in Chains one of my fav bands from that time
Would, Rooster, and Down in a Hole are absolute classics worth diving into the album for too, I just really like the deeper cut songs
This, Junkhead, and Sickman are hands down my personal favs for being a darker dive into the band lyrics wise from the point of junkies.
Dirt as an album is pretty personal for the band, focusing heavily on Layne Staley's addiction

Was gonna talk about it in <#407060923078017026> but figured here would be better:

The story to Dam That River is about how Jerry Cantrell, the band's guitarist, and Sean Kinney, the drummer, got into a fight. Sean broke a coffee table over Jerry's head. Jerry wrote the song as payback.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NewrZ6ivFcY
Always love hearing covers of this song
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tE8JuNobBik
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDfxszrPabw
And the demo recording of it available on the deluxe edition of Badmotorfinger even refers to it as Black Days III
This song in question was actually made during the days of Badmotorfinger, one of their biggest albums. Initially it had the line "Fell on black days" instead of "Cry on black rain"
Damn, I forgot the people behind Metalocalypse animated a Soundgarden music video
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K913KVe3kH8
The last 17 minutes of a legendary album
Hell, here's a video that does the full thing
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zsd2KpXZgsE
Us and Them/Any Color/Brain Damage/Eclipse have cool transitions
The songs in this album are meant to be listened to in a "start to finish" order, but honestly I like listening to a few in that order
Yes
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_83urK9rO4U
Like this theme
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bqcswB6JCIg
It's a nice detail how the OST had the OP as a leitmotif.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4fI3Uk6eSfo
<:MahiruOmegaLul:643294216533049367>

I like how less over-produced Layne's voice is.
This and Down in a Hole have "Original" versions too
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IYjS2pj01XE
It's a lot more raw/unpolished.
I've never heard this song like that before. Wonder where it comes from.
This is... interesting.

Well, it was Ticks and Leeches ultimately they barely perform live because Maynard destroyed his vocal cords during it
I'm surprised knowing the song had this part where Maynard screamed for around a minute
Damn, they did this live recently?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rUnPEvZMQ1A
I love songs that just have a bass prominent right away
Oh my god, it really is!

<a:MariaBlush:493803272360951808>
Very pretty
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
90s alt really was heavy with its themes
Stone Temple Pilots, Alice in Chains, this band
I find it weird most of the bands I look into have some messed up history involving drug abuse and write about their addiction in the songs
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1mUhLZkV8KQ
Sad that they weren't given more composer roles, as they did a nice job making the first Sly game sound very stealth/spy-esque
Their last work as a composer was CTR Nitro Fueled
Just read that the person who composed this passed away last year. RIP.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eZFueoNLqmc
Sounds so... eerie at times.
The remix heard in Paranoia Agent is good, but I like the tone of this version a little more

<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Rainier Fog of what I heard was a fine album. And the live performances of Will def give off Layne's vibe a little.
I think I'm not too hard on newer AiC stuff. Will does a good job at carrying the torch.
William DuVall performs this one pretty good
Acoustic and unplugged make for great listening experiences too
All of Stone Tempie Pilots appearances on David Letterman are great
This for instance
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=elcSs--VILQ
I also really like late show performances
<a:MichaNod:493803314593660958>
I remember as a kid not liking live performances for some reason, mainly because I liked the studio version. I had no idea what I was thinking, either.

Compared to this, which sounds like Shadow's mind is focused on a personal fight instead of helping out anyone but himself
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EguvUh3TvGU
My fav thing about this final stage's music is how it sounds like it should:

Shadow's destroyed a lot of the world, so he has one last thing to do before conquering it
Yeah
<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Final Haunt and Lava Shelter are bangers too
The best final stage music of Shadow imo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo44M2uW5RY
Oh cool
One extra good detail is how the video's color hues change. It's blue for a majority of the runtime, then there's that orange at the end.
The video has made me tear up once or twice. Its message is powerful. That ending too is just so good.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n7TLTjqUyog
What a wonderful song.
This song got me through tough times and the music video even more

OK Computer is a fantastic album though
Metascore 100 worthy ig
This album is just the original and a bunch of bonus tracks
Wtf
But no one talks about them
They're supposedly super influential to the grunge scene and plenty of big bands
King's X
Well, not *this* version of the song
Like it was recorded in between Bleach and Nevermind, but is on Nevermind
Damn, this hits different
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xAy---wp_DQ
Yasha's theme is the best

It was one of the experiences of all time
We sat for most of the ride in silence after Something in the Way ended only to be hit by an incomprehensible metal barrage
I remember the time I listened to Nevermind with a few peeps on my way home from school and heard about a hidden track
The only hint you got there was a hidden track prior was this on the back of the CD case

Honestly should look more into the album. Dig's a classic but I really enjoy the bassline work here
She did eventually pass away in 2005, this song and album came out in 2000
Looking into the lyrics and what was written about it in interviews, the song was all about how the vocalist was frustrated everyone in his family forgot about his grandma as she was growing older.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Stw20G0sfh0

UT99's soundtrack is grand for how it manages to convey atmosphere on most levels while also being kickass
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-aCK23DybdM
Either way, both are great songs. You could say it doesn't matter which one you like.
V2 is great and matches the fast paced nature, being 2 minutes shorter than the first version
There's a debate on which version is better, and I think I like version 1 a lot more.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHkO-N-gx0Y

What I love about SOAD's material is how it was effectively one of the louder voices detesting shit like the War on Terror and a constant jab at certain topics. At times it's hidden behind a layer of surreal lyrics that take a bit of reading up on to get, but I think that's why I love them.
One of SOAD's best songs imo
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KAEBfiaY6Rc
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IgyX6K237xI

The animation on this is still really good. Stop motion seems to age pretty gracefully.
But still love it
And was the start of my love for surreal things that make me go "What the fuck did I just watch"

After a whole EP of slow, melancholic tracks, I love how this one changes it up a bit just to close things out. Not the greatest song on the EP, but it's hard to taint an EP that's already got 6 other really good songs.

Again is painfully personal to Layne, as it's all about the effects of heroin and he uses the lyrics to jab at himself for getting his then-girlfriend at the time, Demri Lara Parott, into heroin.
Their self-titled isn't their best effort, but it was from a time when the band was going through extensive troubles with Layne Staley being deep into a crippling heroin addictions. Songs like Again and Grind reflecting their status as being *that* band known for things intended to be behind the scenes making it to the public eye. Grind, the album's opening track, was written specifically to address rumors of Layne Staley dying or losing limbs.

(Also there was some nasty stuff involving him getting really pissy towards Emi Jones, a big member of the Sonic fandom, extorting her for money and sex, the latter of which she vehemently shoved him off for)

Ehhhh Hunnid-P is uh... a very terrible person, I'd say they could get someone else.

Track 1 sounds like something you'd put in a Pokemon ROM hack during a creepy dungeon
Instead, Roy Harper, who was recording his own album at the time, stepped in to help since David and Roger were dissatisfied with their versions of the song.

Honestly haven't listened to Momentary outside of Learning to Fly and On the Turning Away, but I hear divisiveness on it given Roger Waters had left the band and this was a solo work David Gilmour made into a Floyd album according to that review I screencapped the title of. So I'd understand people's anger.

This has been "Das rambles about music" message #525
You'd think the most celebrated rock opera album of the 20th century could *maybe* get its pieces put together in one place, but sadly that doesn't happen here.
Peeping the immersion box set that released in 2012, neither song made it despite that album containing demos and a few nifty bonus materials.
But it was tossed onto the movie of The Wall split into two parts, both hitting the notes they should. So it kinda baffles me that What Shall We Do Now and this track, both put into the movie but originally intended for the album, weren't tossed on some reissue or put as bonus materials on a remaster.
Sure, it's *extremely* personal, since The Wall's protagonist parallels Roger Waters
It's shocking to me that this song wasn't on a repressing of The Wall.

This explains why the two later albums, A Momentary Lapse of Reason and The Division Bell were severely lacking in a few areas. With Momentary Lapse the only key members of Floyd were David Gilmour and Nick Mason. Then eventually Richard Wright joined back on for The Division Bell. Pink Floyd's history is such a turbulent read overall.
Reading into it, after The Wall Roger was on an ego high and released The Final Cut, which was done without Richard Wright since he left during the recording of The Wall.
I haven't made it to that point in the game yet, but the music regardless is *beautiful*

It's been 24 hours and "Everybody's gonna wanna ride your Chocobo" lives in my head rent free
Oof

Not a huge CoD fan but I gotta pay my respects to this title in particular. It's pretty solid.
The brass balls on this title, even in 08, were astounding. Never have I seen a CoD game as blunt about how fucked up WWII was than this.
Was reminded about how creepy this was
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6bcsXeuK8kk
With how many times I've listened to it, it always surprises me when I look at the time and realize "Wait 3 minutes in this 7 minute song have gone by?"
My favorite song off this album

Though it is an interesting decision to put one of Asura's most important fights from a story standpoint *in the demo*
Reminded of the many times I played the demo before fully getting the game myself and being blown away

Being able to hear all that background stuff through a good pair of headphones is nuts
Always weird when you listen to a song and you can pick up on the vocalist taking a breath between verses
Such a menacing boss overall since you're facing someone who's been infected by the fear of God that it's made him powerful
But I **love** the fight before it and its OST
Like, Godsibb is great and all
There's something about this track that I love
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPJxMDmoghA
Startup sounds afaik ended with Windows 7? I know that 8 and others have 'em, but usually the startup sound is off by default on every version after 7.
With XP you had that installation song that'd play (if your sound drivers were working of course) during the "Out of box experience" portion of the install
They stopped doing this sorta thing after XP iirc
"OH THEY WORK NOW"
Remembered when I couldn't get sound drivers working and getting jumpscared by this when I'd boot up my VM years ago lmao

I like the element-breathing part of combat too. Remembered playing a bit of the first Legend of game and finding that in particular neat
Oh true
A shame that it didn't sell that great. For a God of War clone, it looks and apparently plays pretty solidly
Well, I did see a rundown of the first 2 games from watching reviews and stuff
üëÄ
I've always had interest in it, so I could def try it out. But at the same time, I also wanna complete the other 2 Legend of Spyro games, despite hearing the first one is OK and the second is really frustrating
Kind of wanna try the game myself now since it is apparently working on RPCS3
Dawn of the Dragon's soundtrack is *beautiful*

They really went all out with Prime 1's soundtrack
An alien sounding theme to match, well, a giant alien
I **love** the final boss theme, specifically the first phase
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6_BUofQCJLA
Prime 1 I finished for the first time in 2021, **really** good game
But wow the OST still sticks with me
It's funny, I haven't beaten Prime 2 (it and Prime 1 were games I liked as a kid but never finished)

^ This is a personal favorite with how absolutely heavy it gets, I like the Henry Rollins bit

Undertow's a great album imo

Meanwhile in the remaster whether you go original or arranged audio you get Otherworld from the FMV (Which I prefer)
Was the audio file for Otherworld used in the intro too big to be used in-game?
Wonder why the PS2 version sounded like this
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LQypOUdJ9Cg

It's one of the best opening levels in a game imo, but Samus getting the abilities knocked out of her by a power surge is hilariously ridiculous
I was a weird little kid and loved restarting the game *just* to play Frigate Orpheon over and over

Or if I didn't hear that age old question of how much that doggie in the window is
I liked passing by the record players and hearing Beyond the Sea
The game wouldn't be the same if it didn't have these old 40s/50s songs

<:SerenaLaugh:688836867709337611>
Memes aside I loooooove this song. The bassline alone is worth the 6 almost 7 minute listen
Wow, a song about misunderstanding? Is that a Symphogear reference?

Looking into covers of this particular song have been interesting. I like the instrumental covers of Black Hole Sun the most, so whenever I see a full band cover of it I like focusing on that more than the vocalists.
Unusual to hear a cover where the vocalist isn't trying to 1:1 cover Chris Cornell's vocals. Also the lack of "And wash away the rain" from the chorus is interesting
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OWvYMsI5LX8
This is like one of my favorite bands and albums so I can go on for awhile about it
Really interesting of them to put Layne in glasses because they pretty much filmed one of the music videos with him wearing them the whole time due to hide that he arrived to the set high off heroin
Highly understandable. Didn't know they did those vinyl deals like that tbh
LMAO
Oh my god
LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOOOOOOOOOO
I'M BLASTING THIS AGAIN
AW YEAH

It's so neat hearing the original person playing it note for note as it is in the song
