yes
not usually into idol stuff (if thats the wrong term, my bad, i know there's singing) but mecha + eldritch creatures mixed in as well sounds fun (and i also listened to 1-2 songs i stumbled across and liked)
thanks

Though he'd be better off as an exclusively Galvatron design, the trilogy always had Megatron at the start and later turning into Galvatron for some reason

When the Megatron colors in that was Galvatron + some Unicron orange (because plot, he had an Armor of Unicron of sorts)
And for some reason the Cybertron one...was just G1 Megatron colors
But as a jet
Energon's was litterally G1 Galvatron

Tsubaki maybe?
Maria....idk
(him too)
Ogawa and Bang for obvious reasons
(yes im counting Genjuro)
maybe leaning more towards Azrael
Genjuro...basically the same as Hibiki i  guess
cool
Ragna and Ver are voiced by the same guy?
*wait
wit
Shirabe...not sure...maybe Nu-13 again because multiple smaller weapons? but Shirabe's weapons are saws while Nu-13's are swords
Adam and Hazama because they both got drip
Carol and Nine, definetly, both are witches
Hibiki, again, various
and Nu-13/Lambda because....swords again (especially giant ones)
Hakumen and Jin because swords
Basa could work  as various characters
Ragna absorbs life energy and Kirika flat out destroys souls
i mean both have reaper abilities
tbh i think Ragna and Kirika would work better in terms of similarities
Chris and Noel are more similar arsenal wise
nah
SONG staff doesnt get enough appreciation

Oh, protag changes at some point
What are all the seasons?
And those are all seasons?
And what order
But where to start
Well, duh
In <#371105434771390465> or dm, whatever works better
Anyone familiar with that franchise got a minute to talk a bit with me?
Oh hey Lyrical Nanoha (i assume, i havent seen it but im interested and remember some designs ive seen randomly) fanart
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/89739829
Thanks for the answers
Welp, that should be it then i guess
Alright i guess
I recall hearing that the franchise started off as a spinoff and branched out into its own thing, and the movies remove the odd tie-in stuff (but someone else earlier mentioned some character development is cut out too apparently, at least on Nanoha)
Tho the first 2 seasons have movie adaptations, whats more recommended
Well i guess when i begin start with plain Lyrical Nanoha and ask more later in other places
Oh, so kinda like magirecord for madoka i guess
Canon ones?
Okay...as for movies, its just the first 2 seasons with movie adaptations?
Are the mangas their own take on the story or bonus content?
Like, just plain Lyrical Nanoha
I said basic
Thats the order, all seasons or still more?
Ok so basic, A's, StrikerS, Vivid, Vivid Strike

This is Chris WITH heels
Wait
Maybe
Younger than Hibiki even iirc
And dmjii are the youngest of the cast too
Oh so just 1 year
Uhh isnt that the age Chris starts out with tho
So im not sure
Mami is older than them all, but i forgot her exact age
Other than Mami iirc
I thought she was the same height as Homura
Oh wow madoka smol

(well s1 Fate that is) ||
ONE OF US
i thought he was reffering to another show, not High Guardian Spice (he was talking about HGP and i didnt notice, he said "second season" and i noticed too late)
nvm
youre reffering to HGP
wait no
too bad the writers are spineless
just what i heard
i didnt watch so i didnt comment my opinion
symphogear is a cartoon
badly promoted crunchyroll show (heard some meh things about it after release, since it actually came out, but otherwise idk much since i just wasnt interested in it)
high guardian spice

the older stuff doesnt look horrible, but it aint super-outstanding, it just gets the job done
by Nanoha i mean specifically S1 and A's, StrikerS also has a similar artstyle but it is a little improved in some ways (though id still say Symphogear has a more noteworthy glowup)
S1 (Symphogear) aged better visuals-wise tho, Nanoha's visuals get the job done enough, but it aint anything top-tier for the time apart from ocassional atmospheric or stylish scenes (thankfully there's the recap movies for S1 and A's that modernize the visuals but also have some other changes; i recommend both anime and movies)
recommended
great series too

<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alessandro_Cagliostro>
<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fran%C3%A7ois_Prelati>
real-life Saint-Germain was said to have met real-life Cagliostro though, but not Prelati, the real one's older than both (while in Symphogear it's Saint-Germain that's the oldest)
Saint-Germain's real-life counterpart was a dude too but the Symphogear one is only a brand new character loosely based off him, the Symphogear one is a cis woman
who were both dudes
theyre meant to be the real life people
GodBikki
oh, Chris mini-arc
anything else...
(Cagliostro though isn't a creep)
and Prelati is also, sadly....well, look up the real Francois Prelati (the shinais also hint at that creepy part)

do they have a combo attack name?
hmmm
Nanoha with pink laser beams
Hibiki befriends with punching

<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yknow let's move to <#371105434771390465>
i dont recall perfectly what i was told about it
(iirc they got the license for western releases but their subs werent good)
shame about how Amazon handled it
yep
and even Yuuno himself isnt that interested, he mentions in A's
Yuuno only gets teased a little once or twice, otherwise it's more NanoFate teasing
Fate, Yuuno, Arf and Precia are all new
and yea, Fate wasnt in the prototype material, she's new and replaces Chrono
ik Lindy was also in LTB, what's she like there?
Suzuka and Alisa are also a vampire and a ghost respectively in the original
(and why her dad has scars if you pay attention)
that's why you have her siblings training in S1
her family are ninjas
yea
then Lyrical Nanoha was born from that as its own thing that got bigger than its roots
Lyrical Toy Box is a spinoff with Chrono as the antagonist (he's basically proto-Fate in that, even ends up with Nanoha iirc)
so theres this eroge franchise called Triangle Heart, the third installment being the noteworthy one
since Lyrical Toy Box was a thing
i assume its from prototype material?
it's great
got into the series by late last year
ah
she gets Zenryoku Zenkai to replace it
Lyrical Magical is part of her first catchphrase in S1 but she drops it
nanofate <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>

A FUCKING ARMY LIEUTENANT
what about that guy who was stopped for no good reason while driving
BUT TWO
not one
oh wait
this time the victim was straight up shot
didnt we just recently have ANOTHER FUCKING HATE CRIME from cops?
holy fuck
etc.
room for cowards who are ok with too much compromise with the corrupt old establishment
*the
room for extremists to take over among thhe chaos
a new establishment to stabilize things, made from scratch
opportunists from the outside who want to take advantage of the internal instability
opportunists who just wanna blend in and loot and destroy for the lulz alongside those wanting to do something good
but also because it can cause even bigger issues
revolution is the only solution that assures change, but the problem is that NOT ONLY it's risky as fuck because of an establishment with a lot more resources and support from some of the populace
exactly
watch as Chauvin gets away and that kickstarts ANOTHER riot
theyre gonna provoke the people too much at some point
these idiots are litterally playing with fire (the cops)
plus can lead to even bigger issues
so thats why its not tried
but its risky and extreme
well there is
clearly not enough
George Floyd from last year
not enough either
Ferguson from last decade
those werent enough apparently lol
oh yeah also the oldschool Rodney King riots too
chaotic
but yknow
protests with some good people, some opportunists, some extremists, yknow, mixed stances, but all ACAB
cops or authorities commit hate crime or let scum get away
srsly its been a fucking pattern this last decade
oh
because "muh brexit"
UK and France used to but UK decided to bail out in recent years
since France and Germany actually get along nowadays
honestly only central Europe is close to finishing the process
yeah but its gonna be a slow process for many countries
yeah, history mostly made up of fighting eachother
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_War_I

theres your answer
european history.
uhh
remember that it came from China btw
everyone's too busy bitching about vaccines
nope not ending
just the beligerents change
Cold War never ends
(and many died of course)
it was very dedicated to the eastern front too
and both wanted to fuck it over in some measure
tbh it had no choice but pick either that or the USSR
Hungarians are most likely Finno-Ugric
the reason is exist is politics
Austria is german
that moment when even the balkans are more stable than north-east of it
yeah
and no way its surpassing the USA
aint coming back

The upper class doesnt give a fuck about morals
"morals"
so they just dont care enough
also because many people are comftable enough with their conditions or too demotivated
it will inevitably be made to suit the creator's views
so it ultimately WONT be an unbiased, pure personality
and WE, imperfect humans are the ones who create  the AI, nothing else can
...except that if an AI bugs out things get messy
well logically our best bet would be AI
that
oh
Marcus Aurelius?
i assume they mean people like..idk
oh ok
who, me?
again, i do not discriminate based on race, culture, or religiion, i do not think that this "elite class" is ruled by "the jews"
i dont mean to sound like that
once again, if this sounds too alt-right, tell me
indeed
i am also not opposed to globalization, unity is great and refreshing and im open to welcoming it, but if its under this elite class with companies like Disney wanting to be at the top...that's....not the best option
(before you ask, no, im not one of those who thinks its "da joos", but i do believe in an elite class that's corrupt, maybe even flat out stupid considering, say, the shit going on in Brazil with the rainforest and pollution in other parts of the world, and looks out only for itself ultimately at our expense, i just simply dont discriminate like the disillusioned people who go too far the other way in their frustration with the elite)
other more obscure people who are unheard of before something controversial about them makes it big on the news then  they  dissapear
the rich people or big tech
the politicians
its the fucking elites
its the elite
blacks in the USA arent the only wronged minority
yes
but what about people in other countries who are wronged?
*most
BLM is talked about the mosot
the problem is the lack of multitasking
its an issue
im not frying my fucking brain for this
NEVER.
i will NEVER fucking have it.
*widespread
if that thing ever goes widespead
like dumb cops provoking leftists and minorities yet again
USA has other issues
look at Brazil
shame that politicians all over the world keep having pollution running rampant in their countries
a better monarchy, yes (until Napoleon lost in Russia), but a monarchy nonetheless
back to where they started
back to monarchy
as in
then a friggin empire
a temporary republic
what did the french get out of their revolution?
communism is highly malleable due to the chaotic nature of revolutions
like i said
authoritanism isnt an inherent part of communism
i mean, i dont think you can use that term for when Mao was in charge (state capitalist)
it just depends on who's in charge and what the party feels like doing
its just simple propaganda
but again, propaganda
hes right
yes
propaganda
again
look at North Korea
propaganda

sadly as we've seen with how people act and think nowadays we still have a bit to go until people finally see the truth
its about treating all HUMAN races as what they really are at the core, HUMANS, no intolerance or glorification, just normal human beings
its not about believing whether race exists or not
basically what Morgan Freeman discusses here is the unnecessary focus on skin color (yes, it can be unnecessary even from the left, just in a different and less harmful manner than the alt-right who, well, we all know what they're like in regards to minorities) and people trying too hard to act like theyre tolerant, when all it takes is simpler stuff
(dont mind the title, its a bit incorrect, just watch the clip)

ofc racism is still a thing

Yeah
Stay safe
It sucks how bad history has treated your people
Ah, youre jewish
And watch as the far right will use that to say Hitlerian shit
Shame that its only gonna give ALL jews a bad name
Thats what politics are
Its a complex spider web that needs to be burned
Its not easy because nukes and tons and tons of complex arrangements that change the circumstances
As well as overly complex politics, alliances, compromises
With nukes being a thing everyone's afraid of starting shit up
But thats it
They served their purpose for WW2
Nukes were a fucking mistake
NOTHING.
And NOTHING is done
And even today theres STILL genocides happening
Rwandan genocide anyone?
And force is sometimes needed
Theres no force nowadays
Yeah
They know almost everyone around em wants em gone
Yes, because Israel knows what its doing even without aid
Tbh more chaos in the east might be better in the western politicians' point of view
US
Yes
And states dont always represent who people are as individuals
Israel is a state
DO NOT talk about all jews when talking about Israel
Also, important disclaimer
All they do amounts to a mere slap on the wrist
UN aint shit
Worst Israel would ever get is a complaint and thats it
And as for even more external help, lets face it
No help from other arabs
Palestinians can cause chaos but theres no way theyre winning this
A reason why Israel has been successful is Arab incompetence
K
And is well willing to take advantage of it
Yes because China knows that the international community has no spine
Because it basically says theyre fair game
Yes
Plus nukes
Who knows with how the world is developing
Maybe
Its a revolution after all
Theres gonna be tons of deviations
But sadly with something as big as that
The only fix is a BIG worldwide change in every aspect of humanity
Yes im aware
A museum was the best choice for it
A Greco-Roman cathedral and a Turkish mosque
Plus its of dual religious and cultural nature
(Like Erdogan converting the Hagia Sophia back into a mosque instead of keeping it a museum)
But then again theres Turkey which has had islamic hints from time to time despite being secular
So might be wrong
I might be missing something tho
Some kind of secular republic?
As naive as this sounds

For obvious reasons
Israel invests a lot in defense afaik
Instead of the usual far-right or far-left ignorants
Its good to see people who actually know their shit in here
Ofc its problematic
If it includes ethnic cleansing
I mean
Sorry
Riothamus is one possibility but just one
Hes a fictional character based off one or multiple Romano-Britonnic warlords
Arthur's historicity is also HEAVILY disputed
Romans ditched Britannia by then
He wasnt
The welsh are whats left of romanized Britons
Whats left of them are the Welsh
Britons is the term you want to use
Gaels too
Scots are different
Uh
Celts from modern day France (those celts actually reffered to themselves as such)
Iberian celts
Theres multiple types of celts
By celts what do you mean
Uh

Its a possibility during such chaos on both sides
Both of bombs and extremists from both sides (yes, even israelis, i recall one case of them mistaking one of their own for a palestinian)
If theres booms, be careful

They HAVE reason to -
Its their homeland
Thats the thing about Israel

actions like this basically imply that SEEMINGLY advocating for equality and tolerance aren't just simply just causes, which is exactly what they are, JUST CAUSES
it instead implies that SEEMINGLY advocating for equality and tolerance are also extra popularity points even for the liars due to how easy it is to say something supportive

they pretend to be supportive...but then see how some employees have been treated
a good example is Ubisoft
all someone's gotta do is say something supportive and that's it, they seem more like someone good even when their opinion is different
its been turned into a trend that people can easily profit off
thats an issue with how equality and tolerance have been handled in the west
to pretend to be the good guys AND corrupt these causes as well at times
this is why they want to turn just causes like equality and tolerance into trends
This.
Thanks, China.
https://mobile.twitter.com/DDNewslive/status/1399710299666599936
what the fu
Indeed
Ik its foreign countries, but still
Its just not as energetic
But in worldwide issues like...yknow...still going GENOCIDES...
Like, you got people protesting against racism and other discrimination in the US and to some extent in other western countries, thats all well and good, dont get me wrong
The progressiveness is nice, but i feel like some issues should get the same amount of attention as others
Then the left, while more progressive...i feel like it lacks enough attention and focus at times
As well as status quo that happens to be one with them and their buddies in a circlejerk
The right, of course, already obvious, old values that happen to be unprogressive ones
Like, so much about politics dissapoints me
But the followers too
And i dont mean just politicians
Also alt-right, some parts of the left, etc.
Sorta
But i personally feel dissapointed with both big sides
This is a bit unrelated
FUCK THE BIG COMPANIES
https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/06/record-labels-sue-another-isp-demanding-mass-disconnections-of-internet-users/
Also prior to that the discussion was about Scott Cawthon being pro-Republican
Though i did give an argument in here as an example
I was just voicing my views on people rather than being upset at someone in here
But look at you two
I will admit, frustration gets even to me
This negativity.
This right here.
Like
I feel like some people seem to care more about putting the opposition in its place than just doing the right thing
Oh and another thing
Because i feel like it can derail in a number of ways
I just feel that greater thought and calm (except when the response crosses the line) should be used when addressing progressiveness
With the  genuine extremists being few in comparison and stuck on 1-2 big platforms
Thankfully it seems to be mostly just joking
Im not even a westerner, so im not offended by, say, the Bri'ish jokes (and im sure very few are offended by it)
Im not offended, but i do find it odd when equality is preached at the same time
I also find it odd how, when moving away from oldschool jokes about minorities, people are still ok with making jokes about majorities
Sure
The lack of focus can also spawn extremists that make everything about race, religion or culture, like say, when some random person does an oopsie, it feels unnecessary to me when they specify that the one who made an oopsie is of a specific race or religion or culture (unless its a hatecrime of course)
Even in cases where they dont truly believe in those just causes (Ubisoft is an example)
Also the just causes can easily be hijacked by pretenders from both the commonfolk and the elites for easy PR
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/06/10/health/bats-coronavirus-china-genome/index.html
dont ask why they do shit like this

this
But its also easy to pretend to look better
It can be genuine, yes
All someone's gotta do is fly some kind of rainbow or something that says PRIDE or LGBT or something like that, say something supportive and bam

already reported
On June 29, 2021 Massey was charged in King County, Washington on one count of immoral communication with a minor after he allegedly sent pornographic photos to a 13-year-old girl during the months of December 2018 and January 2019. The criminal charge came after a 2019 lawsuit in which the girl, who was not named due to her age, said that she met Massey, when she was 4 years old. As she was interested in a entertainment career, this lead and Massey became close to each other and their family. With Massey even indicating that the girl should come out from Seattle, Washington to live with himself and his girlfriend in Los Angeles. According to the lawsuit Massey "held himself out as a father figure" to the minor, which lead to their contact being increased in November 2018 when the minor indicated she was interested for a role on a rebooted version Cory in the House. About a month later, Massey allegedly requested to be the girl's friend on Snapchat, and shortly after sent her "numerous sexually explicit text messages, images, and videos."[7][8] In a statement delivered by attorney following news of the 2019 lawsuit, Massey denied the allegation and also called the lawsuit an extortion attempting claiming that, in early 2019, the attorneys representing the minor had demanded $1.5 million and threatened to go public with the allegation if he did not comply.[9] According to TMZ the minor's legal team initially opted for the civil suit against Massey, but according to documents, it would end up nowhere because the lawyers didn't believe that Massey have enough money to make the case worth it. So, a sheriff's report ended up being filed. According to documents about the case police were given a thumb drive by the minor's mother that contained the allegedly explicit material Massey allegedly sent over Snapchat to the minor which reportedly contained a pornographic video clip and a video of a man who appears to be Massey exposing his penis.[10][11][12]

i havent updated it in a long while

oh dear
No idea honestly
And it ended with a massacre of anyone who remained in the riot
Yes. Sport hooliganism nearly overthrew an emperor
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nika_riots
Have an example from the Roman Empire (in today's Greece and Turkey specifically because by then the west was lost to independent germanic kingdoms or germanic nominal viceroys that theoretically represented imperial authority in the west)
And trust me, it can get even worse
Football hooliganism dates all the way back to the Middle Ages in England. Fights between groups of youths often occurred during football matches organised between neighbouring towns and villages on¬†Shrove Tuesdays¬†and other Holy Days.[7]¬†Merchants concerned over the effect of such disturbance on trade called for the control of football as early as the 14th century.¬†King Edward II¬†banned football¬†in 1314,[7]¬†and then¬†King Edward III¬†in 1349 because he felt the disorder and violence that accompanied matches led to civil unrest and distracted his subjects. A number of other monarchs and various authorities also tried to ban football through the centuries in England and Scotland but they were largely ineffective.[7]
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Football_hooliganism_in_the_United_Kingdom
Been this way since ye old times
A LOT of chaos
Lets just say sports can sometimes cause
couldnt they have been more careful when addressing such a sensitive subject? especially when i assume its possible to at least see which employees are registered criminals (tell me if its not possible)
tolerance, equality and diversity? all good
but then you have people like this tarnishing the image of those just causes, giving fuel to the far right to use to denounce these causes
pedophiles, opportunists and other assholes running rampant hijacking just causes
this right here
this is exactly one of the things that gives the far right fuel
especially with one of the lyrics being that AND with some members being registered criminals (meaning that looking in their past to make sure they're okay people is assumingly possible, right?)
....youd think the company would be more careful when adressing a sensitive topic like this?
...and it turns out some members are actual registered sex offenders.
so basically apparently there was this gay choir, it apparently had a lyric like "we're coming for your kids" or something like that...
https://twitter.com/ReviewsPossum/status/1414034253067730948
but the thing is the majority tends to not care enough or part of it sides with the elite minority due to personal bias, livelihood conditions, misinformation, or other factors
ofc the influential ones are the minority
something coulda been done about that earlier but NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO rich influential elites have to keep squeezing every bit of money even if they contribute to an event that can kill us all, even them
oh and lets not forget global warming
how can i have faith in humanity when all i see is ignorance? and if something good IS being done (and, to be frank, internally sometimes there is good stuff done, its just the big picture that seems to just constantly not have anything good going for it), theyre usually not doing a great job at showing it
its just a massive web of too much complexity, ignorance, corruption, incompetence, arrangements, blackmailing, biases, selfishness, cowardice and other bad shit stopping or heavily delaying the right thing from being done
and on top of that all that overly-complicated bureaucracy bullshit to slow down everything
plus the internal issues (that still  aint being fixed completely and have their own sensitive subjects as well) in a good number of countries today already discourage some governments from doing too much externally
...and best they get is a diplomatic slap on the wrist for that because nukes, or internal corruption sparking up bias for that government, or enough strength to make the cowards in the other governments afraid, or a sensitive subject to make the coversation too complicated to continue
like bolder and more openly scummy governments free to do scummy things that go as far as even genocide
indeed
many countries' governments are just recently constantly showing huge incompetence, cowardice, corruption, or all three
and not just in the USA
but let's not forget that it's the whole establishment that's fucking up
republicans are worse, yes
i blame the entire establishment for the culture war
i did make sure to read through for details
basically, from what im reading, here's the situation:
the judge, in the first place, could excuse sexual interactions with minors, although only straight vaginal sex, theres 2 issues, the judge being able to excuse pedophilia in the first place AND discrimination towards LGBT
the good part about this is that it removes the discrimination towards LGBT....but the bad part is that it doesnt also remove the other issue, the judge being able to excuse pedophilia

corporations as they are is one worrying part about globalization, especially with their increasing control
they'll do anything for it
Acti-Blizz and many other corporations heavily enjoy sucking chinese dick
Problem is that people in general dont care when it comes to issues in the world
look at how some corporations bend down to China for that precious chinese money
megacorps dont matter where theyre from
(and this is coming from someone who hates the current state of the US too)
so best to just hope the US reforms greatly instead of falling
the thing is that the alternatives to world domination are even worse
while the US has its own huge issues
well the thing is that's far from the only bad thing it does
with the same reaction as before
the situation gives me a grim deja vu
especially when forming a new government out of the revolution
the label communist litterally means ABSOLUTELY NOTHING after a while

The July 31 deadline has come and gone, with neither Democrats in Congress nor the White House having extended it. This could leave¬†millions¬†without housing as landlords resume what they lovingly call ‚Äúproperty operations.‚Äù And while congressional Democrats and the administration are still in conversations about what they can do, the main battle plan for each participant appears to be ensuring that the blame for the ensuing mess sticks to someone else.

christ what the fuck is up with this virus
the rabbit hole goes....very deep
yes.
On Thursday morning, Chandler's gender categorization on the VINE custody request system was changed from female to male. The VINE system transmits jail and prison records to the public in order to provide status updates to families and interested parties. Hoffman did not provide a reason for the change. 

The Daily Mail reported that Chandler was to be "housed with women inmates," though the jail did not confirm that to Insider.
and now....theyre labelling her male
what confuses me is that i recall she was being sent to a women's prison at first
apparently now shes labelled male

Chris-chan was on mainstream news. (Someone linked me this, im not American)
Speaking of shit news sources
It failed with basically everyone that wasnt persuaded or bribed into stopping massacred
Yes, sports teams got people to try and depose a head of state back then
They underestimate how big Justinian's issues were
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nika_riots
Retaking Africa was fine actually (Vandals werent on good terms with them, especially after deposing their only pro-Roman king, and Africa was an important province), its Italy that he shoulda been lighter on
ummm

What exactly did he do for those comparisons?
its all about circumstance and what the rulers think works best, regardless if it's communist or not
also after some point the Communist label litterally doesnt mean anything to a state
Trump also fucked up in the US

but otherwise yes
whataboutism is a favorite of openly oppresive countries
but id trust it over China any day
*well
USA is shit as welel
no whataboutism

ofc people will trust them even leess

about Hermione
im very much aware that the elites are too busy flinging shit at eachother and trying too hard to get the people to do the same with eachother than actually trying to fix the real issues
that was a rhetorical question
fucking lazy, ignorant, decadent bastards
now are you FINALLY gonna do something against climate change, elites, WHEN HUMANITY'S EXISTENCE IS AT STAKE?

nostalgia
sooo
welp i enjoyed the series when i was young
but yea, otherwise, whatever else comes from Rowling is basically worthless
been a while
or wait, 7, since the movies split Deathly Hallows into two
the main 8 books are fine if you can enjoy them (i did)
not a good look for the elites of the world
(about Epstein) and to think it goes as far as even people related to heads of state or even heads of state themselves
i have to respectfully disagree, and i'll keep it at that to keep things civil
but 8 years old is just WAY too early

that's why im sickened by it
dont worry i share your opinion

i mean the whole situation was basically buried after the suicide news cuz people just moved on

Fuck China.
what a surprise
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IT3Rf_GJst8
but with that, and politics sweeping in even in regular activities like gaming, basic chatting, celebrities and so on, i got sucked in and had no way to get out when politics were litterally everywhere
before 2016 i tended to not care much about politics
i think that happened to a lot of people
me personally at the time i was also sure Trump had no chance, even though i did know Hillary was also a shit candidate (btw im not american)
Trump didnt just come out of nowhere in a perfect America to ruin shit up, people already had issues with the establishment and the alternative to a shameless Trump was a Clinton of all people
from what i know, people either voted for him for the memes, for alt-right reasons (yknow, American Caesar/Hitler and all that with how he was talking about mexicans), or because they thought Trump had a chance at being different in a good manner in at least some regards, thanks to how he stood out
and ofc, to many people's surprise, he won (to the point where even South Park's creators had to quickly rewrite a season because they were that sure that Hillary would win)
meaning those elections were basically "pick your poison" to people, with Trump seeming like a meme candidate that had no way of beating Hillary at first glance

but again, Hillary was also disliked (and iirc there was some scandal regarding emails with her), the Clintons dont really have a good reputation among commonfolk from what i know, and for Trump, the meme factor worked in his favor for hardcore memers and the alt-right and his shameless rhetoric did still make him stand out from a generic politician, so Trump did have his own appeal
from day 1, actually, day 0 (as in, as soon as he became a serious candidate for presidency), people knew he was shit....but guess what, his opponent was fucking Hillary Clinton of all people
i do get tired a bit of the overblown complaining but he deserves it for a number of reasons like his "it's all fine and dandy" policy on covid, best reason i can give for that is economic preservation but even then i think that policy was idiotic as fuck, then also his pretending to carer alt-right braindead idiots, and i do mean actual idiots if youve seen the lack of disguises in the capitol riots; speaking off those, i say pretending because he basically ditched the scene once shit got heated like a spineless coward, cant even care about his supporters, as idiotic as they are
theres a lotta reasons why people bitch about Trump even today
i mean
oh im not complaining about the Trump remark, but about blaming the afghans

I have been on both sides during my time in the FNDM
Isnt that what has been done above?
I do think some people are gonna constantly use that to shut me down
Well seeing how im basically being called a fucking conservative for being uninformed on news sources and rush with sharing  them, then thats being used to disprove me when i say that the goddamn critics are better and venting about my anger at blantantly offensive comparisons to minorities
Oh great, now thats being brought up too, so im being watched and analysed thoroughly huh
It isnt, im in the critic community and theyre geniunely fine
Fuck this
Great, even here im not safe from the bias
Just venting, this offensive comparison regarding minorities just angered me beyond belief
Thats why i didnt put it in animechat
Because it brings up Ben Shapiro in regards to minorities
What they say is slander
Theyre the ones constructing arguments based on hatred
Theyre that sensitive
Im not making this up
Silencing critics completely
Shares its moderators with r/RWBY, tho from what ive seen r/FNKI's community had more backlash towards the decision
This weekend they tried silencing the critic community on a perfectly reasonable critic post
Theres minorities too among those critics too, reasonable people too, and this shithead lumps them in the same boat as goddamn Ben Shapiro?
Ive been on both sides and the critic community is geniunely far more welcoming, open and tolerant than those overly zealous, lying fascists in r/RWBY can ever pretend to be
Thats a lie
This is its FNDM.
Pro tip: avoid RWBY like the fucking plague
Got a zealot comparing reasonable critics that happen to be minorities to people like Ben Shapiro
With the fights being mostly Monty's to handle since he was great at choreography
Well if he had a plan then hed just share it and let M&K handle it in their way other than a few forced in scenes
I assume the Monty's plan thing?
What were you told?
(Other than a few scenes he got in himself)
He knew he wasnt good at it so he gave the writing to Miles and Kerry most of the time
Monty was at best an idea guy writing wise
(The 2000s jrpg thing)
That could be true
Considering the type of people they were at the time
And its from the start too
And as pug mentioned, the faunus racism subplot and the...unfortunate implications on a major part of it
Dont like him
Clickbaiter
Hero Hei
Theres one popular ship that the show has hints at...but constantly small and pointless ones (with one fight being the one meaningful part) that seem to just lead to more pointless hints rather than actually "clicking", its not like HibiMiku where its obvious and heartwarming
Well, at least from my perspective, some people dont have issues with LGBT content, but just how the show mishandles some of it
Ughhhhh
I already fucked up big time by venting
Asking since well
Welp should i dwell into my own issues with some things in the show?
If it was bad, it probs cooled off over time
The community im with arent that type, but hey, believe what you want considering that earlier comment about me sharing shit sources
Stuff like Monty's supposed plan isnt what i base my opinion on, i just wanted the show to get eventually good and i find it too late now and on top of that it left a bitter taste in my mouth alongside other FNDM drama
Which is why i stopped watching
My criticism is based on the show just not delivering even after 8 years writing wise
If the status quo is corrupt enough to give you benefits, why change it? Fuck the commonfolk amirite?
Ofc, apart from easy-af pretending to care about tolerance and diversity
Corporations go hand in hand with conservatives
I bet Nestle's gonna love this bill
Oh and if those elites are sued, guess what, the victim cant do jack shit because OFC the elites get the best and most ruthless lawyers to wear out the victim and drag things out, also the ridiculous costs

All that to encourage settlement just for some glorified toilet paper rather than genuine justice

Oh and if by some chance things escalate further, someone gets Epsteined, an elite or a victim
we live in an age where literal CYBERPUNK is the future and, partially, the present, and not the cool futuristic environments, but rather the vices that big corporations are prone to and the ensuing result
DO NOT ALLOW IT TO PASS IF YOU VALUE YOUR LIVES.

Yes
FUCK GOOGLE.
(Might be wrong about some small details)
Sunnis are fine with anyone fit for the position
Shias think that Caliphs (which translates to Successor btw, Muhammad never had this title) should be descendants and relatives of  Muhammad
Theres some other differences but succession to Muhammad is essentially the main part
Shias think that Ali, a relative of Muhammad, and his descendants are rightful successors that have been wronged
Sunnis are fine with how its been
Basically the main thing theyre split on is Muhammad's succession
Shocking i know
From what little i know ISIS thinks Taliban isnt extreme enough
....and theres been another bomb just now from what im hearing
(Also on bad terms with Taliban)
(Yes, theyre still a thing)
ISIS is most likely behind it
So, Kabul airport's getting bombed, with casualties too
The system must be torn apart, cleaned up and rebuilt.
They dont.
Do you think the elites care mac?
They are now
But with this ended
Meaning evictions werent allowed
Fuck all these complex bureucratic terms, someone needs to revise political vocabulary, is this good or bad
Basically it has to do with people losing their homes

https://www.politico.com/news/2021/08/26/us-officials-provided-taliban-with-names-of-americans-afghan-allies-to-evacuate-506957
And yeah Taliban seems at least open to whats really necessary, still extreme, but even they arent as bad as ISIS
Taliban has guerilla experience too
At this point if you fucked up with the Taliban just get them to help out with eradicating ISIS while theyre still underground
Yeah
Speaking of ISIS
https://www.independent.co.uk/asia/central-asia/isis-afghanistan-attack-airport-bombing-b1909479.html
ISIS i think also claimed a caliphate but well, ofc many will refuse their claim
Theres been claimants to the caliphate but they werent solidified enough or were refused, Ataturk intended on giving the caliphate to someone with the condition that they reside outside Turkey but the person refused out of loyalty for the Ottoman dynasty, then Hussein ibn Ali claimed the caliphate too but was defeated by the Saudis, then at Cairo there was an attempt to decide the caliphate's status but nothing came out of it due to lack of participation
Btw nowadays theres no caliphate, it was abolished alongside the Ottoman Empire (the Ottoman Sultan was also the Islamic Caliph, Sunni that is)
The root of the issue stems from mystery regarding who Muhammad wanted as a successor, and that is IF Muhammad even designated one in the first place (which isnt known for sure either)
Or wait you talking about uk?
Well the right wing lost at the capitol
Or heck just London
Just England
Nah
This
Republicans with right-wingers, democrats with left-wingers
I mean, look at how the two big political sides are siding with the two sides of this trend
Its a conduit for change but the ones in charge know how to keep things safe
Other than liberal ideals being trendy again
Not by much id say
And how slow should it be? A whole fucking century?
Do they not matter too?
And what about the victims of a slow process?
There. Must. Be. Change.
There must be change.
People's livelihoods are at stake. Will you americans still sit back and do nothing even as you get kicked out of your homes for dumb bureucratic reasons? Is sitting back all you can do?

Grim deja vu
Because China
But it seems even fucking WW2 wasnt a good enough lesson
Yes but humans should certainly try to minimize the damage

This sucks
Crap

true, it certainly would be exhausting
the right wont stop without these issues, but picking the just causes out of what the opposition preaches and making those causes seem more appealing and getting shit actually done will lessen the right's influence
there's reasons why the right gets support, and shortsightedness from their opposition that happens to be the biggest representative of just causes (but in a reckless manner and with some opportunist or pretending loud bad apples among em) is one reason
oh crap forgot to turn off the ping before posting
this, they also focus more on what they can handle or what's mainstream to be an activist for (which are still just causes, mind you) rather than every issue
...i havent gone after someone. What
No you didnt start it
Irl, no
But on the internet?
It wasnt okay, yes, i shoulda said that, but, seeing how it seemed to me that i was being targeted hard from the start, i focused more on saying what it was like on the internet back then
So i just said flat out what it was back then
Seemed to me as if i was being targeted from the start with the snark
Wasnt saying using them is good
Helps if you were born in the 00s too to have more insight on older internet trends and behavior
Heck fucking ban me too if you think im a racist like this person thinks i am
Analyse the situation and do what you must
<@&336301457185832961>
How about we call the mods rn
Since youre accusing me of something so heavy
But, well
Im telling you what things were like back then.
So you assume im racist?
Oh so you assume i was doing it too?
Always gotta make a big deal about everything, dont you
Sigh
They werent as careful
Yes, back then, people were indeed more casual about these kind of subjects
Youd fucking lose it
You, with today's mentality, wouldnt survive in those old lobbies
You get kiddos screaming slurs and insults left and right.
An old one
Have you ever been to a call of duty lobby?
Things were more casual back then.

just saying, i dont have details yet with what has been said because im sure nothing will happen despite the unfortunate implications of the whole epstein controversy, why would anything happen to influential people after all unless they become too  much of a liability for the majority of influential people?
yknow, epstein's accomplice
btw ghislane maxwell trial is going on too
quote tweets too btw
fuck America.
yeah apparently in America even an atrocity like this has to be fucking politicized
and its being politicized. nice comments there, twitter.
https://twitter.com/cnnbrk/status/1462570564904755213
i was talking about serious crime too
exactly, you did specify that above, i noticed, and i agree
granted, this is more about bails than sentences, but still
at this point after all this bail jumping this fucking scumbag deserves a life sentence, PLUS repercussions against the idiots who let this happen despite the constant serious crimes and some reform to prevent bail jumping in serious cases like this
https://edition.cnn.com/2021/11/22/us/what-we-know-about-suspect-in-waukesha-parade-tragedy/index.html
besides, there's been a recent situation that seems to be relevant to the discussion
i agree with kat, harshness is better against serious criminals than a more considerate system that turns out to also be ineffective in serious cases due to lack of consideration of the circumstances
STALKER 2 creators seem  to have backed off so far but who knows if it's gonna work on bigger companies like Ubisoft who can afford not giving a fuck because casuals will  eat it up anyways
especially when the majority of the audience is casuals who dont give a shit and let this shit slide, just like how it happened for microtransactions, incomplete-at-launch games and other bullshit like that
but if even media giants get involved, THEN it gets worrisome
its indecent and annoying currently
etc
EA (iirc)
Ubisoft
ahem ahem
remember that slimy af industries are trying to push NFTs as well despite apparently being just a passing trend
oh yea that too
yeaaa...nft business is pretty darn prone to shamelessness aint it
(yes, those are a thing)
i did mean stuff like george floyd nfts
well...dont think so then
oh
including people involved in controversial subjects
thats happened
actually no wait they what they did with steam with games too, some multiplayer games have China-only servers
and even more surprising they didnt replace it with something else
but yea fellas, the NFT trend is...yeah. a big steaming pile of dogshit.
(and on the AAA gaming industry, you just know just how unapologetically slimy they are cuz the casual majority continues to eat up their shitty practices, thats what makes things worrisome, if they think it works, they will help with expanding the trend instead of letting it die)
Ubisoft, EA (iirc), etc.
and worrisome is also the fact that big industries are exploring the trend instead of just letting it die with a bunch of pretentious tryhard shameless nerds
(and Stan Lee has had conflicts with various parties, even family members iirc, before he died)
that too
https://deadline.com/2021/04/chadwick-boseman-nft-sparks-controversy-after-late-actors-oscars-loss-1234744606/ have an earlier example (but less controversial of a death)
they dont care if the person is dead, even tragically, they have no shame
ofc even George Floyd NFTs arent too much for them (especially if they happen to want to troll people by making the nfts)
its a trend with a high potential for indecency and tastelessness
in fact its possible Skorzeny might have even been hired by  Mossad post war, ironically
no
(forgot which)
(or an independent jewish nazi hunter)
or how the US covered up one nazi that was a west german official from Mossad
that the US spared to get medical knowledge or somethin from them
dont forget that one notorious unit
they only cared cuz Hitler was too bold and volatile for their taste

Igor is also hospitalized too
RIP
"US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) documents declassified in 2006 show that the capture of Eichmann caused alarm at the CIA and West German Bundesnachrichtendienst (BND). Both organisations had known for at least two years that Eichmann was hiding in Argentina, but they did not act because it did not serve their interests in the Cold War. Both were concerned about what Eichmann might say in his testimony about West German national security advisor Hans Globke, who had coauthored several antisemitic Nazi laws, including the Nuremberg Laws. The documents also revealed that both agencies had used some of Eichmann's former Nazi colleagues to spy on European communist countries.[147]" (from Adolf Eichmann's page)
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_Globke
found him
but im not remembering his name
ye, trying to find on that was covered
not necessarily good
time means influential i think
(not the Dirlewanger type, more professional)
he was a madlad (not in a positive sense) basically
(i mean im assuming they want roman ones)
as cool as latin is
i cant imagine using roman numerals over arabic
especially when the alternative is a party that doesnt bother to hide its issues as much
well to those who forget about the problems of the democrats or are willing to consider them less important, its easy to fall prey to that
republicans just make it more obvious in their regard these days
both parties are full of shit
exactly
guess the former's true then
so she legit believes what she says huh
either way, she's full of shit
no she's just either legitimately insane (which begs the question why is she even allowed into politics) or tryhard af at catering to right-wingers
of suicide.
reminder that Etika died.
sounds like Ukraine might be getting some breathing room  for a bit
not surprised considering their sheer lack of basic decency

this has gotta be a troll too
that's just vile
oh.
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-59907235
but you can't be reckless even with vax
it helps, yes, im not anti-vax
because just because you're vaxxed doesn't mean you're fully safe
even for the vaxxed
and enough isolation
oh yea, slippery slopes
and now its just one  big mess that might make things uglier in some ways, like people having less faith in lockdowns because of how many there have been...even though the lockdowns were half-baked meaning they weren't allowed to be effective enough at the time
etc.
reckless vaxxed people who thought they were safe just with vax rather than continuing to be careful
anti-vaxxers
idiotic governments
multiple sides are to blame
same but i was lucky so far, never had it
that too, instead of a few effective lockdowns, you just get multiple ocassional but ultimately not effective  enough ones, there's not enough commitment for just the needed ones
and god knows what other mutations this piece of shit virus has in store
but like said earlier, it spreads faster
especially if you live with someone, cuz you might infect them if you get infected
so even more reason to be careful
afaik omicron also spreads faster too
but its necessary
i hate the isolation
look i hate it too
for your safety and, in the grander scheme, others' safety as well
remain careful, minimize contact with randoms unless its people who you're ABSOLUTELY SURE couldn't have covid at that point, wash, use disinfectants
dont just suddenly  go out recklessly and have contact with randoms just because youre vaxxed
ye, thats what i was saying above
gotta contribute to bringing down covid, that's just how it is in these hard times
also wash your hands after going outside, use disinfectants, etc.
back to greed
but when everything is considered calm enough, well
they do need people, yes
the AAA gaming industry shows pretty well that corrupt mentality
maximize gains, regardless if it sucks in the long-term due to infamy
all the money
money money money
fuck the workers
fuck the consumer (even though pleasing the consumer is business 101)
fuck the quality
spend less = better
especially for big companies
every bit of money is important to execs
the pandemic has quite a few, yea

its the industries that have shown themselves to be open to the trend as well
the casual nerds arent the big issue here (they still are a issue for the environment and for artists that don't want their art stolen)
and other industries

since it seems everyone that bothers with crypto wants to use it for useless or malicious shit
if i happen to be uninformed on this subject i litterally flat out DO NOT CARE.
it has NO practical use to society.
nothing else.
crypto is litterally just a status symbol.
oh wait, because the ones in charge are selfish or powerless when it really matters thanks to an unnecessary web of stupid deals/compromises/plotting for stupid shit
so if Earth just can't be saved at this point, why not find a new home for humanity so it doesn't go extinct?
and that is something favorable for humanity considering, yknow....CLIMATE CHANGE IS A THING AND RICH BASTARDS DON'T SEEM TO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT POLLUTION
where's space colonization, huh?
technological advancement has gone too far in the wrong areas
simple as that
its bad? it should go.
fuck all fancy terminology.
thats a surprise
convenient with the Ukraine stuff happening as well
ofc its Putin
ah  yes
yes, jokes aside, theres not much genuine demand for conflict afaik
inb4 another balkan war starts thanks to crypto politics
some that even concern the fate of humanity as a whole
and people either don't care enough no matter how much they pretend to (or just flat out don't care), or focus their energy on other stuff and fail to have enough left for flat out critical things, failing to see more of the bigger picture
well what else to expect from a "culture" that seems to not care enough about their offsprings but rather more about themselves, if they even are in the mood to have any (and with how shit the world is i understand not wanting to make a kid that struggles in it)
and btw i am very much aware of cases where even sibling incest was accepted historically (ancient egypt)
and other communities
except for nobility who still married cousins/nephews because politics
and you have the gall to compare it to interracial and other types of "non-traditional" relationships that unlike incest are harmless
if babies have a chance to turn out worse and if there's chance for toxic mentalities (like abuse as mentioned above) then im sure that means its a sign that it's not really recommended to be done
"hurr durr its cultural differences and shit"
i love how its always the same excuse for more personal things
if it aint broke dont fix it.

only care about the books and probably also the LOTR movies and that's it, simply ignore the rest
well i got a simpler solution
well yea uh if you're talking about parental incest that's a big no
im guessing not tho
wait wynn mentioned a message from that discussion
no
(abuse/bad parenting/manipulative parenting/lack of parenting)
apart from the tragic exceptions
thankfully by default there's parental love to balance it out
yes, the parent is the experienced one, the grown-up  one
it works on frogs
alex jones told me so its gotta be true
not that it's part of their genes
wait i thought chemicals made people gay
it indeed is concerning if it gets in the hands of those that turn out to be scum
humans are imperfect
granted i wouldnt call the latter a puppet despite how cruel fate (which is also an abstract concept rather than something sentient) can be but hey, gotta stick with the mindset here
being a puppet to people isnt the same as being a "puppet" to just pure random fate
people love jumping fast to conclusions sadly
rose i think  this isnt the right environment to try to mention such an opinion, not that i disagree, just giving some advice
ye, cointelpro
subs are considered pathetic
only if the dominant one
yep
on a more positive note you also get to find out that people back then also considered it funny to draw dicks on things like some people today
or on bad shit where you see parallels to today
though it gets grim when you read up more on positive  things that could have been
history's interesting
humans are horrible like i said
you do realize there have been and still are people justifying bad things
truth hurts hard sometimes, but its truth
yep and covid is one rough reminder of how it affects you no  matter how much you try to ignore it, because covid's the type of thing you just can't ignore
me included
the pessimism in some of us i  mean
tbh id say its gotta do with this shit period too
(i'd go for plural but singular sounds more poetic)
human is a horrible creature
its a mix of the  more ugly angle of liking bbc porn (people considering it "exotic" because different skin colors and other weird mentalities) and well, that, pornstar parent

whataboutism is no excuse, you hate a practice? then criticize anyone indulging in it, not just the side that's most popular to criticize
im sure you know what i mean exactly
it doesn't give China the reason to be a grim deja vu however
make your choice: a duplicitous and hypocritical elite desperate to exploit you as much as possible while giving you the illusion that they're enlightened, reasonable and open-minded or an openly conservative and openly harsh elite
it has gotten to the point where climate change might render us extinct in the worst case just because some rich scumbags want bigger numbers
how about when the bad actors corrupt the system, however? when the system itself can't fight the bad actors because it now favors them at the expense of fairness and decency?
not just themselves
dumbass, yes, but for  everyone
ignorant? yes. completely stupid? i prefer not underestimating them
perhaps but even then im worried that it's big players investing in it
if there is change its just stuff they consider small-scale enough to compromise on
^
the problem is that many people either don't realize it yet or have the wrong ideas and as a result bicker amongst themselves more or focus on smaller-scale stuff
then cue fallout
no one's gonna use nukes because  using one means they're fair game for who has them

<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
***juuuuuuuuuuuust*** a coincidence
must be just a coincidence
this might be where it starts
stay safe
if you're in ukraine
welp uh
it doesnt excuse it, yes, but just remember that corruption isn't present in only 1 place
US does, yes, but it isn't the only one
people suck and power corrupts
everyone with power does
yep, cuz people can be horrible and power can corrupt
so then you gotta ask: can there be a trustworthy global hegemon or not?
....but in practice when corrupt or incompetent people are the ones with the hegemony you get stuff like most of the US foreign policy
on one hand, it's necessary to stop abuses and atrocities.....
that's the complicated issue with global hegemony
regular people discussing amongst themselves? sure, but if it's officials working for the government, that's where things should be kept professional
its not even about what Putin thinks of the banter, it's just simply about unprofessional officials in a crisis that should be carefully managed
do your fucking job professionally
Russia's acting like a bully but having professional OFFICIALS mocking it with memes publically is just stupid especially  when the situation should be defused (even though at this point Russia's not backing down and may finally have its excuse from what it seems with the acknowledgement of the separatists)
why would supposedly professional officials working for an embassy use mocking memes in such a crisis?
from the fucking US EMBASSY.
its from official authorities
heres the problem
it wasnt united either, Moscow just got to be the one on top after the Mongols were pushed out then unified the area
in a number of ways
old Rus is different from modern Russia, Ukraine and Belarus
correction: 2013
that's how it started from what i can tell
afaik basically Putin isnt a fan that Ukraine overthrew pro-Russian rulers back in 2014
https://twitter.com/USEmbassyKyiv/status/1496115593149358081
people suffer from both when one of them is bad
i feel like internal policy matters as well, even though external also affects people outside of the country
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_occupation_of_Haiti
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colonia_Dignidad
instead of doing it to just one
im just showing that i am capable of criticizing every big player
if my wording isnt clear, im not defending the US on these
and ofc, the more obvious subjects, like slavery, police brutality, hypocrisy (also outllined above), opposition to necessary reform unless it's delayed and half-hearted enough, etc.
ill give you some criticism for the US as well to satisfy you
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Chilean_coup_d%27%C3%A9tat
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_dictatorship_in_Brazil
show me you can do it for other big players too
you can do it for the US
dont sugarcoat
try criticizing another nation
if no one said otherwise, how about this
is it really that fucking hard to admit that ALL big players have their ugly side?
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uyghur_genocide
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2019%E2%80%932020_Hong_Kong_protests
and pretty harsh internal policy as well
so if you wanna completely ignore China just because the US also sucks, why not ignore Russia too while at it?
Russia's another classic boogeyman for the west
even now?
by that logic, should we also ignore Russia?
but this doesnt mean you should ignore it completely
you get a good boogeyman
when you focus SOLELY on one non-US nation, yes
theyre not doing what the US does, but they have their ugly side too
China?
ahem
theyre afraid of russian hackers i guess
stay safe if you're in the area
knew this was gonna happen the moment Putin recognized the DPR and LPR
it's really happening.
it's happening huh.
soo uh...
everyone overestimates them because they root for them and are desperate to not have the likes of Putin, Xi,  and others they oppose succeed
US, NATO, EU
it's EVERYONE.
Fuwa, it aint Biden that's useless
and, well, Russia doesnt like it and swoops in and it goes to shit from there
basically, pro-Russian administration gets deposed
look up Euromaidan
regain control
there's been news of 9 PRC planes in Taiwan's airspace
especially when China and Russia are collaborating
preferably a stronger one
come on
give me a country that has actually backed off from further instigating a crisis like this just from sanctions
sanctions NEVER fucking work
and includes more issues these days
and answering it is hard because there's downsides to both answers
global hegemony: is it necessary AND if there is a hegemon, can that hegemon be trusted?
yea, ive mentioned it before but it is part of a complicated issue
so guerilla might  be the only option it has left
first attack is most likely gonna wreck Ukraine from what it seems
yea they broke in fast
DO NOT underestimate anyone

well, he has to from a Russian (not me) perspective, Ukraine's no longer under Russian influence (look up Euromaidan) so gotta restore it
anyone using nukes at all has a good chance of leading to Fallout becoming reality
i think what he's banking on with his threats is the west's lack of backbone
also increased activist tendencies in commonfolk
easier communication
that's because of the internet
lobbying is a thing yknow
and yea, indirect is just less obvious
probably national bias
good point tbh
which is what gives him apparent influence
doesnt he still need the backing of some oligarchs?
https://twitter.com/MSNBC/status/1498854872564781057
internet just helps with the spreading of memes, it's very good for communication
Napoleon was mocked for allegedly being a midget when in fact he was just average; germans used to be compared to late-ancient huns (or just generic turco-mongol-ish nomad horde), etc.
wouldnt say its too different in hindsight
eh
yea
oh, him
i know there was this one apparently Taliban member on twitter who shitposted but idk if it was him
i forgot
was there one?
Putin is willing to use force and if the anti-war people realize their chances aren't great they might just give up and move on with their lives as best as possible under the current conditions
i dont have high hopes for it honestly
and just go to being apathetic towards politics
if he's lucky the Russians will gradually give less of a shit about Putin's wrongs due to increased dislike for the west

so not just bogged down?
oh?
no soul
capitalism has no heart
though Moldova has historical ties to Romania so its ok if you get em mixed up
wasnt it a Moldovan ship? iirc
true, though idk if Russia is gonna go for Turkey if it goes for a member
the only way NATO's getting directly involved is if an actual member (Baltic states, Poland or Romania since they're the closest to Russia and Belarus) gets attacked, especially with Putin's nuclear threats (which might be just bluffs, but, yknow, shouldn't risk it, cuz nukes, and if Putin is indeed just bluffing he probably does know that too)
(sarcasm)
how surprising
want to ask for change? be good at it at least
which is ironic when they're the same type that advocate change
yep, people aint good at focusing on every issue
i honestly dont have much faith in humanity too these days
as for that, it just so happens to be something im in the mood to put my opinion in
im certainly not the best at wording my own arguments admitteddly, but still
it is a big assumption yes but what is your argument trying to say?
better?
so you think that people that prefer no involvement at all = people rightfully protesting measures that only harm commonfolk and not the ruling class?
oh i very much agree about nuance (something that i wish people have more often when trying to make an argument) but you certainly aint using the concept well in your argument
so you consider people who are just rightfully disagreeing with things that just harm commonfolk rather than a guilty group of rulers people who'd just not get involved at all regardless of who's right in the conflict?
yes, and i still am
does he (Putin) have any reason to care about those types of sanctions?
does Putin care about russian teams being banned from a mere fucking videogame?
does Putin care about russian cats being banned from competitions?
does Putin care about russian authors being banned in italian universities?
now if the oligarchs decide to get rid of him, that's a different story
just like that.
suppressed.
if anyone is brave enough to cross the line, boom
exactly, Putin DOESN'T CARE.
all because they're under the wrong state?
so you consider it right to oppress commonfolk who are just minding their own business?
that will just demotivate them, not make them desperate to get rid of Putin so things go back to normal (and who's to say they go back to normal once he's gone? there's room for further chaos at that point), it will just make them care only about minding their own business and staying safe as much as possible and, in the worst case, even make some of them pro-Putin, cuz to them, what's the point when the alternative to Putin doesnt give a shit about you either and is going full red-scare again?
oh and what about the sanctions from corporations and institutions that dont mean shit to Putin and ONLY fuck over commonfolk
imperialism yet again. Russia's just less subtle about it
just gotta fuck over some  random commonfolk for fake virtue signaling just because they happen to be citizens of a state that fucks up, whether they support the state or not
typical.
double-standards
hypocrisy
(about the cancelled vaccines)
and that's why i tend to be on the "fuck everything" side
but let me guess Russia's overselling it right?
theyre a thing?
so..uh
exactly, if it's a big trend? theyre fine with compromising if they consider it insignificant in their grand scheme of things, unless you're talking about legitimately out-of-touch conservatives (or people who think catering to conservatives is a better idea than following trends)
point is, if you want a world government, which would be ideal in theory (but not in practice), it has to be done by a trustworthy side and accepted by every side. and there's no trustworthy side. and even if one manages somehow to be for a bit, who's to say corruption aint gonna kick in at some point to mangle the system? humans aint perfect
everyone else? depends but big players like Russia, China, etc? i think you're more familiar with the bad results there
the west? duplicitous, hypocritical, pro-big-immoral-capitalists, pretending to be the good guys, stealing just causes and trying to find ways to keep the status quo as much as possible with half-hearted measures of apparent support
problem is that the current systems in place are untrustworthy everywhere you look
unification is a good idea....
https://twitter.com/visegrad24/status/1501842348132741122
authoritanism? in theory, bad, because 1 person or 1 group of people get more power
in practice? depends, dictators initially weren't viewed negatively in ancient times because they were elected in times of emergency, so hey, maybe there is an emergency that really requires a temporarily empowered person or group of people to help; but on the other hand, you get people like Hitler in nasty cases, who abuse that power and fuel it with their shortsighted, ignorant, or even flat out horrible ideas
democracy, in theory, is the best system, everyone gets a say in the government.
in practice? prone to corruption due to groups looking out for their own interest and it can overall become a big complicated mess of arrangements and deals between oligarchs that can end up mangling the system
theres a difference between theory and practice
its an example of how interconnected things can get, or how about China's export of cheap goods?
you got sanctions against Russia, which, ofc, are fucking over its economy; but also, due to the war, grain exports are affected afaik, since both Russia and Ukraine are important for this part of worldwide trade
mind if i compare to the Ukraine conflict?
especially in a system that has important things interconnected due to various deals and arrangements
what's being a leader of, say, some small management group compared to...idk...being the boss or important member of a company that has a monopoly on something?
because commonfolk tend to get less of an extreme taste of power
https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/israels-knesset-passes-law-barring-palestinian-spouses-2022-03-10/
they just like taking advantage of the situation for better PR because the Russian state geniunely fucked up
well it's not like they geniunely care about doing the right  thing
....but yea. uh. this is a thing apparently.
from what i read up it's in theory just against invading Russians (presumably just soldiers...even though some have shown that even they aren't fans of the invasion) and the state, rather than also citizens
https://twitter.com/Reuters/status/1502036658979495940
wait, it aint about it?
hold off a bit on that issue until things get a little better?
there's a war going on in the neighbouring country with a lot of refugees coming in and putting strain on the economy as a result so...
yea but...uh....
saw it used in servers with people using good sources so thought it was another decent source
hoo boy
especially after decades of conflict and extreme measures by elements of both sides
but realistically it most likely wont end that well imo
well it would be nice to have some sort of secularized dual state that satisfies both sides....
people like to act as if they're revolutionary hero-activists or protectors of humanity, rights or decency these days yet even in such a supposedly self-aware period of society you get barbaric shit like this, even from that same kind of people in some cases
economic sanctions are understandable even though those do hurt commonfolk too in turn, but what does banning some media or participation in entertainment from a country do other than make their people pissed off at YOU rather than their government and encourage xenophobia towards them?
that no matter how much people these days call for fixing problems in society, they still will miss some crucial problems
and that's what worries me in the long run
fuck the dishonest and hypocritical executives, celebrities, rich folk and trendchasing casuals
its disgusting honestly
<:ShirabeSleep:691497302535176302>
if it aint broke dont fix it
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
oh dear
what the
that too
(without being aware)
you may have known her from a symphogear gif account on twitter
<:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
condoleances
never knew her much but
better than being bothered when doing casual stuff
miss the old days
sigh
just straight to the point
i remember when there were no ads
corporations are worrisome
that's one reason why corpos are in such a position these days (another reason being the USA pretending to be worldwide reformist watchdogs while bending over to corporations)
enough monopolies geez
it just aint.
the current system just aint enough to stop this
lol
too bad America's only good at bowing down for all its talk of reform
shame that the only regimes driven to reducing dependence on outside parties are shit ones, for pragmatic reasons ofc
its not enough to keep em in check
yea but even then
not even letting em drink water iirc
dont they mistreat their workers
oh, Nestle?
shame it happened thanks to a damn war
tbh i prefer local independence for products, reducing dependence on outside parties, especially opportunistic big corpos, is good
***NOTHING.*** IT ONLY HARMS COMMONFOLK FOR NO GOOD REASON.
IT DOES NOTHING TO PUTIN.
ENOUGH WITH THE DISCRIMINATION, YOU SHORTSIGHTED SCUMBAGS DESPERATE TO LOOK GOOD.
it is VERY messed up.
it is, yes
https://twitter.com/hybridherbst/status/1504254450659172352
so if you live in either country be careful
Unity isnt to blame btw, it's some thing (RIAEvangelist) developed by another party that was updated to protest the war...by messing with the machines of users with IPs from either Russia or Belarus.
protestware is now a thing apparently
https://twitter.com/hybridherbst/status/1504223953627369480
monopolies, involvement in politics, abused employees, outdated copyright laws abused even when fair use is in play, desperation to squeeze as much money out of you as possible regardless of convenience and quality, etc.
humans aint perfect
never trust people or groups with influence to use that influence well
everyone wants to support big corpos even when it turns out that's a bad idea because of the abuses they're capable of going for
yea, thanks to lobbying
when in reality they're worthless
people are idiots who pretend to be smart
is her name there?
oh great, more pointless and harmful posturing to pretend to look like good guys
https://www.businessinsider.com/yuri-gagarin-name-removed-fundraiser-space-foundation-2022-3
welp, their fault, let them see what their mistakes have born fruit to
like what? stupid shit that does nothing good?
yknow what i dislike sometimes? being told when saying this "then do something"
humanity sucks
but we wont cuz people are shortsighted no matter how much they pretend not to be
no.
what you think corpos truly care?
or it's just JK wanting to partially save face
for better or for worse
people arent that simple sometimes
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Racial_views_of_Winston_Churchill
neither was Churchill
but tbh i dont care that much soo dont do it for me
neither provide proof
i dont understand what you both are getting at tbh
it's disgusting
to look good
to corpos and politicians, just causes are just for commerciaization
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Solomon_Islands_unrest
as it is? corruption from what i can tell
intervention? just Cold War USA again
from what i checked fast it sucks both ways
and specified that i know he probably did it for his own sake
i said afaik
ye
thankfully it didnt
some expected Ukraine to get steamrolled fast, maybe even the Russian leadership
yes,
so, welp, just continue doing work like that, but no, instead a costly invasion that needed to be fast to be enough of a worthy success
Putin HAS done good in the past, obviously for his own sake, but he did help on improving the economy at the start afaik
yes, it would have been most ideal to just continue internal reforms instead of this
too bad the russian leadership still doesnt see that they fucked up
also to stir up more anti-russian sentiment even with the invasion clearly not going as smoothly as it needed to be for Putin
evil breeds evil
especially when Putin is clearly very much willing to put down opposition
some perhaps also know but choose to not stir things up to not get in trouble
its not just them not knowing
doesnt absolve him of what he did mind you
yea heard that even Putin might have been misinformed
what shit organization
the fuck
wait, claims that bold?
i recall some claims from soldiers seemingly being confused
iirc
didnt some soldiers flat out not know why they were there?
either good enough conditions or emotional attachment (just to the place rather than the nation)
especially when home has been good enough
moving out isnt as easy as it sounds
or that, martyrdom
why would someone stop resisting if they're wanted dead anyway? or even just think that they're wanted dead or persecuted
exactly
where someone that far east is shamed even when they dont have problematic views and just want to mind their own business
though i meant in the first place me being worried about too much discrimination to people of russian origin
replace part of the population with russian settlers
that's making sense.
that...
wait
though ngl im afraid of the possible response in the end being Lebensraum levels of harsh
especially under frustrating circumstances
lack of motivation can be a catalyst for war crimes
(ahem ahem, some nazi war criminals that were luckier)
especially when the problematic subject happens to have enough influence or is useful at a later time
sadly in some cases it goes the other way too, too little force that is
the only force to apply in response to a problem is only what's necessary
and yea a logical explanation for this might be the leadership having no choice but to misinform soldiers to maintain enough morale
no they dont, its just business
and the heir is apparently trans, hah, like they give a fuck about the cause, doubt things will change
yep
again, they're petty as fuck
and Disney didnt like it
iirc there was a case where a dad with a dead son wanted to put Spiderman at the grave
theyve been petty like this before
disney is ruthless when it comes to copyright
yep
apart from specific stuff like, say, fanart
tbh i dont like most of Twitter much either
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
why should i give a shit
just another circlejerk like the Apple-Epic lawsuit was lmao
both are rich
whats the difference between as it is and under musk
or was it the estate's
i meant the company's heir
sigh
dont reffer to it as fighting when you're talking about corpos, in disney's case it's just to look better, simple as that
how?
is that not hypocrisy?
they can say trans rights, then deny a dad a heartwarming simple spiderman thing for his dead son or film a movie at a controversial location and thank the staff there
sorry, but im just showing how hypocritical Disney can be
easy to act like they care
France still has overseas territories
My guess? Economy, especially now that despite the dangers, COVID's being less talked about these days and the current war is also affecting trade and economy
Le Pen is worse
People just dont care enough
Things do spill out in fact sometimes
Yep
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qEViaSC49YI (mentions the war so thought it should go here just in case
Getting the whole team banned is too much, it was just one player, right? Remove just the player and thats it, the  team ofc can quit on its own since they're missing one
Yes, ik about the stuff DeSantis is trying to do against Disney
Theres reasons, yes, COVID and now the current war affecting trade, but its still higher prices for things people buy, even basic needs, so even with understandable reasons, people will be upset about that
Oh yea, economy also plays a role in people's choices, especially when they notice degradations in their daily life, like higher prices
By default they wouldnt get enough support imo, but under current circumstances its best to hope Biden isnt enough to dishearten people into not caring about him or another bad Republican winning
DeSantis seems more serious but also less charismatic, and Trump's charisma has run its own course imo, doubt he's getting a second term
Yknow, that anti-Mexican wall he was boasting about in his election campaign
Trump didnt even finish his wall afaik
Still, why not do better to make people think it was worth voting for them, why not make sure they're not disheartened by bad decisions to the point where they stop caring even about a bad candidate succeeding
Yes, also they might have exhausted their more charismatic options with Trump, who i doubt is gonna get enough support for a second term, so a democrat victory is still possible even with Biden's fuckups
Biden's issues = room for another republican win

Simple as that. People will want change and those who don't care about left and right and whichever of these the two parties pander to will vote for who is more convincing when they say they're bringing change (good or bad, doesnt matter, it's change to those people)
And self-interests
This is under a democrat president btw
Its always those 2 that win and both are shit in their own way
And of course theres sadly no non-Democrat and non-Republican option that will get far
Exactly, how a person in a position of power views things can be different from a regular person
Yea
So if your wording is off you have people missing your point completely because to them you will sound as if you downplay the tragedy
Though id be careful with the wording on events like this because, well, they're tragic events
Also with them being big news, people will of course be focused on them
With stuff like COVID or the war in Ukraine, of course theres economic effects due to hampered trade
Well, it certainly is advantageous
And it sucks because the louder idiots help distract
Rising prices, increase in authoritanism, ineffectiveness, half-measures etc.
And when it comes to politics you bet people will want to look good there
You get pretenders, trendchasers, opportunists, unfair or shortsighted people who miss the point and make the cause look bad, etc.
Being mainstream has its downsides in some cases, even when its just causes sadly
Both suck.
Am i being petty by saying that? yes.
I consider pop culture references in regards to serious situations childish
Should be done right now
Self-centered or self-righteous? Sure, feel free to consider me such
Im nitpicky. Because i see too many shortsighted people these days who are right regarding some things and wrong or immature regarding others
Im specifying what i consider bad (Putin using Victory Day for propaganda) and what i consider harmless
You said any military parades
You didnt specify
If you do mean this Victory Day, yes, it is nationalist, of course Putin will want to use it for propaganda, even when the purpose it was made for was a victory against actual nazis instead of wrongfully slandered people
Just simple, patriotic ones, not toxic nationalist ones
Well, tell me what you find supposedly fashy even in regards to basic ones for harmless causes
You said any military parade
Id ask what is this damn world's major malfunction instead. And no, im not reffering to damning Putin's usage of Victory Day as propaganda, im reffering to your apparent aversion to basic parades, in general even for harmless causes. And if you did want to reffer to just Victory Day this year, or other authoritarian parades, shoulda specified
Boo hoo hoo
Pop culture references for serious situations are idiotic
But idc much about crypto so
Heard some rumors yea
Oh, blackrock
Huh, believable huh
Yea.
And people are, well
Crypto misfortune happened
Only do it to follow trends and get more supporters, diminishing the effect of true and honest reformists
Corpos act like they are all progressive only to be exposed for stuff like this or work abuses, or for having an automated tool for their representation (as if its some technical quota to fill out for more money instead of, yknow, just what a person is like) instead of having actual people help out with that
Rainbow capitalism
Ah yes
Pressure from oligarchs?
Apparently the most recent one might have been a white supremacist from what im hearing in another server
while more pragmatic people profit
desperation to be right even when missing the point
And theyre trying to deal with a AAA gaming company of all things
Never underestimate how petty people can be
Its D V R K
Its not dark
Ok its in other servers too
Guessed as much
Or they take -
What roles do they prefer usually
The person notified you?
Ah
Strange
Huh
Eyup, seems to be a bot
Anime and nonsympho spoilers
Its on other channels too
Seems to come from Greg Abbott apparently
Finding sources saying its 15 dead now apparently
And 15 people (some adults included) injured
2 dead children
Deaths too
Yes
Texas elementary school
...another school shooting just happened.
Sorry to spoil the fun but
Welp
Not necessarily just those.
But also those who manage to corrupt the system or find gaps in its security, resulting in profit for them and suffering and injustice for others.
Seriously ik the US has a recurring gun violence issue but theres been even more than usual happening recently, or in faster succession
SHOOTING
FUCKING
ANOTHER
...
What i see is a fucking mess that might sadly end up uglier, resulting in reckless decisions
Not to mention other interest groups that take advantage of these arguments to gain from it rather than because they genuinely care about one side
And the more necessary change gets denied or downplayed, the more desperate people will become
But even those had at least partial pushback from some potentially opposing element
Attempts? Yes. I do not deny there were genuine attempts like MLK
From what i see in America and its history, i don't see much genuine change
I personally doubt the change in America.
Wdym what
It may just me not having faith in people either, but still, the fact that some people are this confused and uncertain about everything says something
Just evolved and divided
Soccer moms never died out as a mentality really
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COINTELPRO
Disgusting
It is extremely easy to just put a symbol and say a positive message while you do otherwise
Classic America
Ah yes, the usual half-measure (or nothing) bullshit after big promises of change
Good, fuck Apple
Every side of mainstream discourse can't see the bigger picture.
Oh yeah, those too
People have been bitching about YouTube's state for years and the staff doesnt do jack shit about it because they know its filled with many memorable videos that people don't want to throw away and because no alternative is successful enough
If you have enough influence and money any negative reputation does not fucking matter. You're completely free to be an unfair hypocrite.
Welcome to modern-day big corporations
Voiced Josuke in the part 4 dub iirc
RIP
Oh dear
They apologized back then and fired the cartoonist but yea
Its done this before though apparently, with Netanyahu
Im not german so any germans pls say more if you wish
Apparently its a leftist newspaper from what im finding?
A Stalingrad survivor got arrested for protesting.

Its far harder than it sounds on paper, especially with the current conditions that pressure people to focus on looking out after themselves and their close ones as best as they can.
Ah
(Im not familiar with Ezra Miller's past record)
Another?
Wait, the victim is non-binary too?
Welp, maybe back to gun regulation talk then, though im moving on from this convo
Otherwise you risk being misunderstood
Dont worry, i know what youre trying to say exactly, im aware some people dont fully understand the consequences of what they preach, but that's just a general thing imo and id bring that problem i find in people in an argument about something else
Yeah, i have seen, just wanted to point out the original argument
And gun regulation does
Sometimes people get too imposing, but other times theres no room for compromises
The thing is that because needed progress has been constantly downplayed and subverted for so long and is, people just grow more and more desperate for change, including those who rush to offer solutions that might backfire or not help enough
Yea, i can tell
There's no confirmation yet but things do seem suspicious
I havent followed but afaik basically theyre apparently acting as if no such mistake (on top of the other ones) happened, to such a seemingly desperate extent and with such inconsistencies that it seems suspicious
(I assume the mother is reffering to the father because Miller uses they/them, right?)
So not only is Miller being like this but the father is also apparently abusive?
What the hell
Hm, so Trump wanted to be there apparently instead of leaving his supporters
And not with a clear vision and priorities
Too disorganized
Yep
Or theyre just too stressed out and decide to just continue a casual life as best as possible
Most people dont have good attention spans whether they admit it or not
Overwhelming you
By all means, ruin our chances of survival further
Not so sure now
I didnt think DeSantis has good chances but...with the current momentum and democrat fuckups...
Uses the login token
Bypasses 2fa too apparently
Like Isierka said
Not just that
Scam as mentioned
Good
<@379337518371307522>
Pug, did you click on anything on that message?
Btw apparently theres been yet another shooting
At some parade
Maybe this is how they actually see you. How do you feel about that?
Oh well, not fucking surprised that the ones in charge are out of touch once again
Not to mention poorer areas than what you usually find around the world, how do those deal with such issues, especially if theres local instability on top of that?
But hey i dont see many people talking about rising prices and hunger for some reason, guess that they got other priorities and that the media's distractions work despite the fact that basic fucking livelyhood is at risk
And no, badly written title by mistake isnt excusable. Its a serious issue that should be treated with the greatest care and transparency.
"Fuck you peasants give us money, obviously because of current crises like, yknow...uh..covid and war in ukraine, yknow"
Get well soon
Even if it says negative, take precautions just in case
Yea, try getting one
covid's still around
Indeed
Maybe
Or selfrighteousness
Happens
Thought i picked my words badly
Oh, ok
Was the one i had off the top of my head in the moment
Well, gimme a better term
The few good exceptions just get drowned out by idiots
Even if they dont admit or realize it.
They care more about looking more enlightened than others.
Broom, guess what
People dont actually genuinely care about equality, or just causes overall.
i recall hearing something that its a matter of companies refusing to provide info about users to the indonesian government, but i might be wrong, memory's fuzzy on this
Especially with current events giving them good excuses to give to people as they act to earn more
Planned by billionaires through lobbying ofc
Very well
Not the first time but since you decided to respond to me i might as well point it out
Someone didnt read the channel name
But also a solution that minimizes discontent, depending on what is done there will be something to sacrifice, and that will cause discontent due to how universal some of that stuff has become
Because now not only there needs to be a solution fast due to climate change
Too bad the ones in charge werent farsighted enough and didnt do anything back then
Unnecessarily childish responses lets gooooo
It would have been easy in the past when these systems were still developing
Soo dont expect much
Youre talking to an idealist who thinks solutions are easy
Its ok, doomer here so i dont mind
Industry, economy, basic livelyhood, thats the stuff that can be put at risk by rushed solutions...yet taking it slow is just not enough to reverse it at this point
Not only is there very little time but the only fast solutions involve sacrifice that will cause other issues since that stuff is so tied to how society works these days
Hm, ok
It just wont be fine for us
Oh, Earth will be fine, nature can adapt, i think
Eh, makes little difference, result's the same and at the end of the day its still ignorance
Or wait thats already irreversible
Woo time for humanity to make the planet dangerous to live on through ignorance
Probably sarcastic
The new aristocracy
Sounds like the same shit they did in south america
Ahem ahem "democracy" ahem ahem
Good question
Few players want to shake things up because they probably know this system is going to be shaken too much for their own liking
Causing other issues ultimately
Anyways, back to earlier a little bit, the point is that the current global economic system is heavily tied to the great powers, if even just one great power is not in a great state or is messed with, the system is shaken
And labor
Also lots of cheap goods
I prefer not underestimating problems personally
Id say it counts just about enough
Look at Russia.
Exactly, great powers are parasites tied to the world economy. Someone stirs things up? You get problems.
Not Ukraine, but again, stuff like south america
Or how about how US doesnt get sanctioned for its own interventionism in history?
Definetly
Oh, the veto
What group?
US is just better at playing the game currently while some others dont care much about the world's opinion (especially when they have economic leverage to avoid any punishment apart from weak sanctions) and only care about making sure that their citizens are kept in line
Every fucking great power has skeletons in its closet. So there's no good alternative either.
The world needs a hegemon to keep things safe but because this world is far from ideal the closest thing to one is the fucking US
Yes but i doubt it
Happened on that aforementioned island and he killed himself in prison (conveniently when you think about it)
And he was associated with multiple politicians and celebrities from various countries
Child trafficking and prostitution basically
Being ignorant and malicious doesnt necessarily mean being stupid
Not underestimating your opponent is common sense
Problem though is also that, even though some countries work differently than a great power, more subtle means of influence still exists
Then i was recalling that you might not  be from there even
*America
Well i was focusing more on Americs
Unless im mistaking you for someone else
I think you said
Oh, Italy was it?
What do you want then?
What you want?
Hahaha
Many are stubborn fucking idiots.
It's hard to talk sense to people too.
Fuck America. Fuck American hypocrisy, self-righteousness, trendchasing, lack of integrity and hijacking of ideals.
Id choose no one.
China has discrimination against certain groups too
Every great power is a hypocritical self-righteous piece of shit.
And seeing that the world sucks because THERE IS NO GOOD ALTERNATIVE.
For having some sense.
Fucking THANK you.
Submarine.
Iirc
Didnt Kim slim down recently?
It has its issues but...any smooth alternative is probably impossible with how familiar the status quo is
North Korea...is...complicated with how long its been going
Maybe, though ive said my fair share of rude things in here
Heck im not the best at wording things either
Thats why i ramble, probably like an idiot
Anyways
Honestly i dont consider myself smart or anything, im not educated in politics, but with all the issues these days that are just harder and harder to ignore, im frustrated that no part of the mainstream gives a solution and nothing is done, even now with all of humanity at risk
Huh, even Obama's lumped in there
Irish music is nice
And now you have a fucking clownshow of ramblings and chaos all while climate change is upon us
Because this system has been badly made up overtime by people that didnt bother thinking ahead far enough
Especially with corporations on a worldwide scale these days
Cultural, economic
Guess i misunderstood your tone
all they did was ruin things even more
rambles about the botched interventions there thats what
I dont have one either personally
Was being more careful with my wording but whatever
Oh well
Ah, you saw em
Say your clear solution for the chaos in the middle east then, i'm curious.
Your tone is quite jokeful for a serious situation.
My bad
Sorry for not making it clear who i was reffering to
I meant Ezra's response
I didnt mean you
They did outright illegal shit afaik
This is just outright insensitive
The system is fucking broken. Everything. And sadly few realize just how major the problems are.
If anything changes, it's small, controlled, with compromise and loopholes
Yep
Uh, hearing it's Truss
The system is broken and few realize just how incredibly broken it is.
Lotta talk about commonfolk having to give things up, but where's the talk about those rich and influential people having to also give up stuff? Nowhere. Just let commonfolk have the whole burden. Let the prices go up, let them have less gas and energy and use just causes as excuses so people accept it.
Why should they actually give up something big, or do something that associates from, say, a big corporation, would disagree with? Nah, just let the commonfolk suffer more, let them have the burden, especially with good excuses available to use and with enough pretending to care about progress?
What else to expect when politicians and billionares continue placing the burden on commonfolk?
Queen dead huh
Sooo
Sure, you can carry a bit, but a car can carry more and isnt big like a truck is
Then how are you gonna carry things and multiple people around? On a bike?
And we're seeing the results
But yea, there's a clear lack of foresight in all of this
Busy traffic and lack of space are already discouraging enough, not to mention driver culture, if you're unfortunate enough to meet someone impatient or just an overall asshole
This has been an issue pointed out for decades yet its been overlooked
Yea, its an infrastructure that causes damage like overcrowding and pollution, yet it must be addressed in a delicate manner because it might mean having comforts taken away
And the current situation is urgent, so a solution has to be found fast on top of that, how can any fast solution also be delicate?
Btw if my response seemed overly defensive in tone, i didnt mean it that way
Sadly recent decades led to a flawed infrastructure that is hard to replace without sacrifice these days
Overcrowding is an issue which discourages even me from driving these days
Oh, in that case, yes
Money ofc
They are very much capable of trying to squeeze money out of you even when it comes to basic necessities
They just slip up less
Yep
From what i can tell relations with the US arent good so from a political standpoint theyd probs try to support rivals even when those rivals' stances are wrong
Probs should also take into account relations with other countries
But yea, it aint justified even when it comes to hating America, considering what the protests are actually about
Im not agreeing with Bolivia's stance, i'm just simply trying to point out the issue of anti-something (usually American ofc) countries ignoring just causes because it can potentially be explained as just another foreign imperialist plot even when it's not and a cause for such ignorant stances
Again, it is not a good reason, not in this context either, the Mahsa Amini protests that is
Thats the issue i'm pointing out, yes
Im not saying its a good reason, yes
A really nasty effect of the US' past blunders that really hurts global unity in the present, doesnt matter if the cause is just or not as long as its the stance of a country that's also a rival of a hated country
Its the root behind many problems
Yep
Good question
Even tho the subjects are serious
Hm, should we move to <#371105434771390465>
But instead of just being grey he was made flat out irredeemable, just like with Adam being turned from extremist mentor to incel, its as if the writers cant read the room, for lack of a better term
Theres good reasons to be crazy prepared
With Grimm invasions, Salem subverting kingdoms, etc
Oh and dont forget to take into account the situation the world is in
"More of a mentor, actually"
-Blake, Volume 2
Adam seems to have been initially made as a misguided former-mentor rival type rather than incel
Or how about Robyn starting a fight in an airship while Qrow tries defusing the situation
And Qrow teaming up with Tyrian, even though it was a guilty pleasure (just wish it was in a...more understandable situation) and Clover was being a nuisance to both
Apparently Miles was even surprised that people found Ironwood understandable in v7 (and by the second half i could already see the signs of what was coming)
Yea but the writers wanted him to be batshit insane fascist
I knew he'd be another Adam, i just knew it
What Ironwood turned out into.
Or make an understandably paranoid character into...well
Yeah...
Nipaa
No, im interested since i heard its better but im busy with When They Cry these days which im greatly enjoying so far
...yeah.
Welp i jumped ship and later found Symphogear
My dislike started growing after watching volume 5
I last was into RWBY for a while but i began hating it eventually
Idk if this is the term but i think you can guess what i mean
I probs shouldnt be even a little surprised at this one either though considering the...what do you call it...frat boy culture?
Yea theres been a number of internal controversies there
Well ik RoosterTeeth had internal problems but...didn't think they'd fuck up this hard, especially with a recent voice actor for a character representing a minority
Kdin? Doesn't she voice May?
So it seems to be one reason why V5 was such a disaster
Happened during V5 iirc
Yea im aware of Gray taking resources to use em on Genlock
Seems like it
Ah, ok
Also, controversy good according to them?
Guess that also explains why RWBY's writing is still bad even after 8 years, they like stans and critics arguing eh
What was up with Genlock S2? Wasnt interested enough to follow it
Thats how we have mtx today
There will be backlash, it might be loud, but most of the time it wont hit hard
A good example that, if big enough, a corporation can just not care
Look at AAA gaming
Yea
So what if theres backlash? It aint big enough and the right will probably hijack it too to drag those rightful complaints through the mud and ruin their credibility
If theres good gain, theres no reason to care about protection and integrity for a corporation
My bad
Was the original subject something else
Huh
Since it will mean lost influence, too much of a fuss in their opinion, etc
If you wanna make a big change in one, the other will likely not be happy about it
Taking lobbying into account and the increasing influence and lack of strong backlash against shit practices, both government and influential elements that include these big corporations should be treated together
Theres bad decisions from big corporations that dont come from the governments
I say both are the problem
Or i just forgot about it
I gotta see that
Huh
Damn denialist politicians of the early 2000s
Id have liked if people wouldnt have had to compromise
Mushrooms are good yea
And its probs what Putin meant by neo-nazi and heavily blew it out of proportion to label the entire country
Yea and again, it was a sort of a problem at least back when i read up on Azov, maybe stuff changed in the meantime
But again, blown out of proportion
He must have meant Azov Battalion which is or at least used to be openly neo-nazi last i read up on them
There is a sort of neo-nazi problem but Putin did blow it out of proportion
Been a while so may be wrong
I recall reading that there was a soft liberal-ish shift after Jiang Zemin and before Xi Jinping
Understanding helps more than oversimplification, lack of nuance and dehumanization (even when it's not with obvious things like slurs)
Yea
Not just brits, really
It's not justification, but it does help to understand why you find hostility and distrust that encourages someone to join anti-west stance, even wrong ones
There is historical reasons for that attitude
The west exploited China for more than a century before
Honestly part of the problem is also history
Isnt there something about the CCP harassing dissenting chinese even outside the country?
Mmm, pizza
I think the play is also where black Hermione comes from, a black actress played her there
Iirc it started as a play and got adapted as a book by JK
Yea, Cursed Child was disliked
https://tenor.com/view/voldemor-harrypotter-mechant-sorcier-magie-noir-gif-12511017
...yea, Voldemort fucked
Iirc
Oh yea Cursed Child had a child of Voldemort and Bellatrix
(I recall something about how magic toilets work or idk, been a while and again basically anything outside the original books is forgettable but it got crazy in other ways rather than just the more well-known gay Dumbledore thing)
And then some of the stuff JK put on her site or wherever she put side material
Also Fantastic Beasts but that was meh too iirc
There was Cursed Child as a sequel already
And it sucked
Some input from someone who was into HP years ago
Anything outside the original books/after Deathly Hallows doesnt exist, nuff said
Too risky of a business when corpos have their heads up their ass and could fuck shit up on a whim while viable alternatives aren't resourceful enough to exist
Pointless disagreement, dont bother
A comparison for those kind of people in terms of mentality are say, idk if its good or not but how about...casuals who buy the new shiny AAA thing, AAA industry sucks but it keeps being propped up by people who throw money at it for the new shiny thing and who dont care about all the piled up controversies
Controversy doesnt turn them against that shiny thing they want, it just doesnt, the AAA industry wouldnt be going as well as it does despite its issues if they'd be more serious about having hard stances in controversies
Warning about the game in a statement isnt a problem, its your opinion, youre voicing it, but when it goes into insistence against more easygoing people who prefer to keep taking things easy, there's no winning that, they won't listen
Knowing how to pick battles where to argue
Personally i dont care about the game, not planning to buy it, but yea, i just dont find this controversy a smart way to voice problems
And its not just you vs conservatives either, theres people inbetween who just take things easy, so imagine what its like for them when one of those sides tries to be...insistent, ruining their mood as they just take life easy
Those easygoing people really do exist, yet people make the mistake of grouping them together with one of those binary black-and-white sides
You just dont win with it, theres just no winning
I know
Like, you wont be listened to with such means, youll just cause even more damage, youll just be genuinely disliked or even more disliked than you already are
There was also that site to check streamers who play the game and apart with disagreeing with the plausible intention of harassment, i really feel like its just not...smart if you want to be heard
Hm, seems like just lack of thought to me rather than active intent, and Sirona seems to be from myth
I do also personally find some parts of the controversy overblown (tried to voice a disagreement yesterday but my wording was shit and i entered unprepared) but at the same time theres also good reasons to be worried
Rowling is a terf and HP hasnt aged well in some regards
So people ofc will be cautious, apparently she isnt involved with this one from what im hearing but im not sure (idc much about the game)
It's a Harry Potter game. From a JK Rowling series
The problem stems from just...what kind of game it is.
Sorry if its a little offtopic other than someone here mentioning points
Anyways 100 points to Griffyndor because fuck Slytherin
-Albus Dumbledore, said calmly, even at the end
Uh oh
apparently the OG team or at least some of it is working on it too from what i heard (Gen Urobuchi included)

Heres a hint:
Watched some anime today
Everything has gacha
Never got into SAO, didnt seem like my cup of tea personally
Ah
SAO talk?
Ik the movie cuts out || Graham ||
Yeah i was told
Went for anime to play it safe but i will check the recaps as well for curiosity
And i know that Triangle Heart filler is cut out
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
It wasnt painful for me
I like em
Why
In that order
The series
Both  for S1 and A's, i watched the anime
Yes, anime
Repeating just in case
Thats where i am
I just finished A's
(Also out of || the main 3, Hayate || looks the coolest)
But yea, even tho i have a fav, everyone compliments eachother with interesting interactions and thoughts
Cool, tho im not much of a collector
Same
Nanoha's VA sings the EDs
She also sings the OPs
Ye
(Any Nana wills it gifs with Fate? Ik Tsubasa has some)
https://tenor.com/view/nana-wills-it-england-for-nana-listen-to-your-nana-gif-11297286
Fate? Yeah same
Fav character? If its not someone after A's
Agreed
<:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
While i was busy watching A's lol
Oh i missed Nanoha talk
But yea visuals are one thing ill check the movies for too
Well ik its an older series so i dont mind
Meh, i like the anime version so far so whatever
Besides || Hayate using the book is triggered by the catgirls disguised as NanoFate making her break down by making it look like NanoFate killed her friends ||
I didnt mind tbh
Did it?
Hi
NOW GET OUTTA MY FUCKING SIGHT BEFORE I PISS ON YOU TOO
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS UNTIL THE PISS DRRRROPLETS HIT THE FUCKING EARTH
(Project F)
ep 6 and 7 did help more though by bringing important plot stuff, hints and implications
i dont dislike it, its alright so far at its core, but at least the first half (or most of it) seems to lack focus
(but i have been slow with StrikerS because more episodes and introductory training that kinda overstays its welcome, from which i took a break from with movie 1; also i know some stuff from later cuz i stumbled across spoilers at random)
i love it so far
recent fan (if 2 months ago counts as recent)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRGSFpeUwiw
oh yeah and also, be wary of the netflix subs, heard they're prone to mistakes apparently, at least for part 5, i recall hearing something of that sort 
they had one line where Giorno is actually saying something along the lines of "i like being alone" to some girls where as Netflix has it along the lines of "i like a girl already"; oh and they also mixed up GER and CR in one line
huh, part 6 brought back the CGI from the previous OPs? sweet (its the good type of CGI)
Part 4 has some lackluster parts that are exceptions (especially if you dont go for blu-ray) but it's not a dealbreaker
really good stuff
David Productions usually deliver on bringing the manga to life
oh

unless it gets changed...hoo boy its gonna be...
<:Cag:423197445644615711>
same
most of the spoilers were about the main antagonist of s1
i disagree
nah
though i will admit that i took a break in the first half to watch the recap movies instead
when the plot kicks in though StrikerS gets better though
like the training
it suffers more in the first half where it spends too much time on things that don't matter as much in the bigger picture
StrikerS is ok imo
found it?
well, her arc, NanoFate, her design (to an extent, she has only my 2nd fav design because || Hayate || looks even cooler imo), scythe || (and giant sword) ||, her theme songs (nana wills it)
ah
(i started with the anime first and prefer it over the movies personally)
|| S1 caught me offguard||
yea, shes my fav MGLN character
ah ok
you new to StrikerS or just wanna find the scene?
probably 2 or 3
forgot which one exactly but im sure its one of the early ones
that's the miniature variant
yea, this one (regarding the befriending i mentioned)
btw i still have to get to the other 2 movies, Vivid and Vivid Strike (and also the games and some of the other side material) but i did get spoiled on ***that one*** scene with Rinne
but yea
to be fair it did give us one instance of ***ahem*** befriending
https://tenor.com/view/magical-girl-lyrical-nanoha-gif-24039586
yea, its worth it in the end, but its understandable if you give up on it
¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
StrikerS, though ive said all i needed to about it
anyways uh..where was i at....
but yea i guess theres just no point in arguing further
i liked the presentation on the first in the series
guess i just cant argue further
but then again i solidly didn't mind the s1 filler sooo
its just  the  first half that felt odd
2nd half feels better
it aint just to be nice and help out Yuuno by that point, it's also to prevent damage in her world
the sheer amount of material damage done by the Jewel Seed helps cement Nanoha's motivation to collect the Jewel Seeds
also episode 3 tbh has one highlight even among the early installment weirdness
Fate is introduced in ep 4
3 actually
like, i get it, device-user interaction is interesting too, but just my preference
also...ngl...a small nitpick here but i prefer Yuuno introducing Nanoha to the basics of magic over Raising Heart
though with the filler cut out
feels too fast for me since the intro is still there
perhaps, but still
the movie felt too fast in the first half for me
and i do dare say i prefer s1 over the movie too (which i dont dislike btw)
but yea, s1 just kept me captivated even with the filler
ive seen worse
it gets the job done as an entry
2004 so old and i  assume not as high of a budget
i just didnt mind the s1 filler
granted it's Triangle Heart filler but it also has extra characterization for Nanoha that the movies miss out on
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gpuoHPxO-1s
prefer the original but dub has its highlights, its one of the better 4Kids dubs (Dedede for example like you said)
i watched the original first years ago, then the dub
(ik thats a movie but still)
wtf revue looks sick
yes, Precia is SS (iirc). like Hayate. AND a natural one, unlike Hayate (who's empowered by an artifact).
(though granted Precia is SS rank so idk if Lindy could do much in a fight against her, unless her rank's there too or close)
why couldnt we at least get Precia VS Lindy before Fate steps in
...yeah good point.
yea, the movie fights are sick
granted Chrono doesnt matter much either later since he's a leftover from Lyrical Toy Box (the prototype for Lyrical Nanoha where he was an antagonist)
yea and || the  Graham plot is cut too ||
|| i still dont forgive Precia though ||
yea
as for the rest, well, some characterization (particularily for Nanoha) is cut out due to it being sprinkled alongside the understandably trimmed down Triangle Heart filler (which i didnt personally mind in the original) (Yuuno also gets less due to this and some of his teaching being given to Raising Heart but, well, Yuuno doesnt matter much later so understandable here too i guess), but on the flip side Fate (my favorite character in the series) and her family gets more characterization due to implemented side content and other stuff
for Nanoha's design....well the new one fits more with the franchise's established style over time but i prefer her old one, the red ribbon breaking up the color scheme was a nice touch and she's still a rookie at the time so her Barrier Jacket not being much different from casual clothing (well, her school uniform actually) makes sense
visuals, yes, definetly improved (fights especially), though a small nitpick is the atmosphere in some scenes being changed (like in the first Yuuno scene, the original was framed to make the monster feel spookier), just small  though, not a big deal
or you just decided to share your thoughts now
you finished the movie?
cya
welp, what was said above basically, but i also recommend watching S1 for curiosity when you want (but yes in the bigger picture the movie has the essentials with some improvements, so starting with the movie instead of s1 isn't bad, i guess you can shove S1 somewhere with Vivid, the Vivid manga since the anime doesnt adapt the whole plot, and Vivid Strike if you feel like checking those too, they're a bit different from what i know, havent gotten to them yet; or even with Force for something lower-priority to check out, but Force is....unfinished, so it's fine if you don't bother with that), but im biased here
oh so constellation is a new fan?

https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/002/004/931/38d.png
oh that was juicy to see
including ***that one*** scene
has the ending been adapted fully yet?
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
>eren
k
which one?
(Fate)
oh yea and she's also in  my pfp if you havent noticed
though im gonna go soon
its always fun discussing an anime you like with a new watcher
continuing rn or some other time?
while Nanoha's VA, Yukari Tamura, sings the EDs
(she also sings the OP)
ye, voiced by Nana Mizuki
although Yuuno (the ferret) has been theorized to be based off one, Mazda Eunos, though it's not clear enough and there's no confirmation
Nanoha herself has none though, only later characters get car names (not in S1, other than Fate and....someone you'll see later)
Nanoha loves car names lol
Ferrari Testarossa
car name
my favorite Nanoha character <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
Fate Testarossa
yea her name is Fate
new fan?
in both roles
eren's a joke lmao
oh yea wasnt  eren on both protag and antag iirc
ZENRYOKU ZENKAI
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Xk4BRQqDg
(then Vivid and Vivid Strike, the 4th and 5th seasons, after StrikerS, are also different from the previous stuff in their own ways, but i havent gotten to those 2 yet)
btw StrikerS is a bit..different. for better or for worse (StrikerS is a bit flawed, let's say, especially in the first half, but it's worth trying out to see if it's for you, it does eventually pay off). just something to note for when you  finish A's
lol
Yuuno's alright, not outstanding since he doesnt get much focus, but i dont mind him (NanoFate here btw)
oh and speaking of Precia/Presea, she's the one other reference to cars in S1, her and Fate's surnames like i said are from the Ferrari Testarossa, but Precia's name is from the Nissan Presea
(though ep 6 || already hints at the abuse by showing scars on her back in a few frames, in case you missed those, they're visible when she discusses with Arf ||)
ep 7 got me good when i first got into the series
|| poor Fate ||
yea
no problem if you're undecided
btw favorite character so far?
kinda, yea (though from what i can tell Symphogear fans generally seem more split on S1, G and XV, where as for Nanoha it seems people tend to agree on just A's being the most solid plot-wise/in terms of well-applied focus on things; ofc, enjoyment regardless of quality varies and is up to the individual)
most Nanoha fans afaik think it's basically the best the franchise has to offer, anime or movie version
A's (season 2) has a more solid and focused plot than S1, even the original A's (since the A's movie, just like the one for S1, cuts out some things and adds its own)
yea, theyre worth checking to see what you prefer (though only S1 and A's have recap movies, StrikerS aka season 3 and the others don't)
if you want a version of S1 that focuses a lot less on those things and just gets straight to the important stuff (though as a trade-off you do lose some characterization moments for Nanoha since theyre sprinkled with the leftovers, not a dealbreaker though) watch the recap movie when you feel like it (though be careful with checking out the commentary from characters in the recap movies since it includes characters from later, so, spoilers): modernized and better visuals overall (you do lose a bit on some of the atmosphere in a few moments, but again, not a dealbreaker, just a small nitpick), more epic fights and implemented elements from side content that focus on Fate and her family (backstory elements are included too); i did find the pacing in the first half a bit odd, but again, i am used to the original anime so it's just me most likely, you may not find it odd and it does seem you might prefer the movie when you get to it
you dont need to check Triangle Heart or Lyrical Toy Box at all, by the way, Lyrical Nanoha is separate from them apart from the aforementioned strange focus on their leftovers, i didnt mind it but i know some do
it's early installment weirdness, with the initial focus on them despite  their lack of importance being thanks to them being leftovers from an eroge franchise that Lyrical Nanoha's creator also worked on, named Triangle Heart (3 specifically); Triangle Heart then had a spinoff prototype named Lyrical Toy Box with Chrono being the antagonist (basically in Lyrical Nanoha he was replaced in that role by Fate and he was turned into one of the good guys; Yuuno, Arf, Fate and Precia are new, they weren't in the prototype) and that prototype grew into Lyrical Nanoha that gradually distanced itself from its roots to become its own thing (but it took some time because of those leftovers and the initial focus on them)
(with Nanoha's family and friends)
back, i assume the meh parts were the filler?
what did you think? (brb, i'll be back later if you wanna discuss more)
btw if you're curious about Rynith who appeared in Fate's dream while she was imprisoned in the book of Darkness, she's a familiar (like Arf) created by Precia to train Fate, both because Precia's health already began declining by that time (yknow, her random coughs in S1) and because she flat out didn't care enough to train Fate herself (she wanted to focus more on her experiments and had already started disliking Fate, but still needed her for errands), that part of Fate's backstory is elaborated on more in side material (that also gets implemented in the recap movie for S1)
and speaking of that part (which is an idyllic fantasy formed by the Book of Darkness from Fate's mind): notice how Fate doesn't replace Alicia in it, both exist together as sisters (Fate is still a clone in the dream though) with different personalities (albeit Alicia in the dream acknowledges that if she had survived in the real world, Fate would have never existed); the character interactions in A's are great honestly (or how about when characters discuss how the Wolkenritter should be treated due to their status as magical constructs, albeit sentient ones)
it means || less focus on Chrono, who is the last remaining Lyrical Toy Box/Triangle Heart leftover still focused on a bit by that time (and even then since the catgirls focus on interrupting fights between all the protagonists and the Wolkenritter he isn't the sole focus in that subplot), but even in the original, the plot remained solid and the subplot honestly didn't distract at all, it was a pretty nice one imo ||
i like both S1 and A's, even the anime versions, but A's definetly has a more solid plot with more focus on the important things, even in the original version (the movie, just like the one for S1, changes things; in the movie's case it cuts out || the Graham subplot || and adapts the rest to fit without that part, plus some other additions)
good to know <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
ah
since, well, it's got horses
...which makes me wonder what DP will do with JoJo part 7
probably because its hard
the dark young scene
wew
i remember the S3 CGI
oh, we talking about overlord now
since you're going to StrikerS next, as ive said it's a bit different. for better or for worse. it does pay off eventually but it takes some time (especially since it's two times longer than the 13-episode-long S1 and A's) so it's understandable if you give up on it early (it's not bad, mind you, but it is definetly a bit flawed)
after StrikerS you can either move on to Vivid and Vivid Strike (which are also different in their own ways...and Vivid's also a bit flawed since it doesnt fully adapt its manga from what i heard) or to the recap movies, then after those watch the Reflection and Detonation movies
also, here are A's vehicle references: Opel Signum, Opel Vita, Opel Zafira, Maserati Shamal (Shamal may also have bonus themed naming since some other Maserati models, just like the Shamal, have names based off winds, and Shamal's device is called Klarerwind); Hayate may also be a vehicle reference but it's used as a name for multiple vehicle models (Suzuki Hayate, Nakajima Ki-84 Hayate, etc.; so hard to tell which one exactly) and otherwise it's a regular Japanese name for people so she's probably not even intended to have a vehicle-themed name (though the meaning of the name is related to winds so it may still be a similar case to Shamal's wind theme)
well that's the craziest one
oh yea another fun part is the Persona (JoJo stands basically) summoning methods, you've only seen the least crazy one
Yu Narukami is basically chad, Makoto Yuki (P3 protag) is monotone and aloof (P3's theme is litterally death so, yknow, expect a dark atmosphere at times) and Ren Amamiya (P5 protag) is stylish and charismatic
so the animes have to make up their own personality based off dialogue  options in the games (certain options hint at personality traits but up to you if you pick em)
the persona protagonists are blank slates for you to roleplay as apart from appearance and voice
its pretty good
what did you think?
good for starters
get 5 Royal
just havent gotten too deep into it
dont dislike or like the fandom other than the stupid ones from time to time
though im not much into the fandom
i like Persona
but Chibi isnt even remotely canon to the main show, it's its own thing completely
yea, the characters in chibi are legit more enjoyable. RWBY Chibi is the lighthearted spinoff, yknow, like the shinais for Symphogear
so try avoiding the fandom if you check after v3 other than fanart
it gets heated after Volume 3 in some areas basically, with both reasonable and extreme people on all sides, with the more extreme ones having shit takes, making false accusations, etc.
then theres how seriously you should take the plot in later volumes and if you do take it seriously you question  some things then you think of the implications (some being unfortunate due to the meh quality like  i said, by mistake for sure though, i'm not a fan of Miles and Kerry but they don't mean to insult)
on the other hand other than that heated subject, there's some better examples, albeit less noteworthy
like, i get that in some media, it's more common to just hint a gay ship, but Hibimiku has nice chemestry. it feels natural. it even has occassions where it's meaningful to the plot (S1, G, XV, partially the AXZ finale); but that RWBY gay ship im talking about on the other hand: so far not much meaningful teasing and the one big meaningful plot moment that the ship gets, again, because the writing quality is meh at best it's not as well-done of a moment as it could be quality wise and it affects other elements in the story in ways some fans may understandably not like, again, due to the writers just seemingly being incapable of doing a good job
oh and if you want more fuel to the fire: there's a popular gay ship that the writers like teasing later....but so far there's been no satisfying payoff, the chemestry is seen by some as questionable and some also think that it detracts from more important things if the ship is not gonna be progressed further (and you know, alongside those more reasonable critics that criticize just the quality rather than the idea of having a gay ship, you got the more extreme ones who bash the idea)
and it gets REALLY aggravating at times after V4, especially in V5 and V8
by Volume 4 they have a few years of experience so you'd think that with the new focus on plot (at the expense of how dynamic/cool the fights are, which is initially understandable due to Monty's death, but they dont improve much from V4 later other than a few alright ones in V6 and one in V7) you'd get better writing....but you don't. you only get a tone shift to have an illusion of a serious, well-done fantasy epic
....but the main problem lies in the quality of the writing. it's always been amateurish, even in the Monty era, but that era made up for it with fun and the indie factor
i hate RWBY these days but here's my attempt at a less biased suggestion:
check the first three volumes at least, see if you have fun (thanks to Monty's AWESOME fights, but he died after partially finishing some of V3's fights, RIP)
after those, the show gets a new tone with a focus on plot (which tbh started with v3 partially, but v3 is counted with the other 2 out of the first 3 volumes as the Monty era, the one where more RWBY fans could agree that they enjoyed what they were getting, plus the show was still a bit indie until V3)
P5 has you painfully ripping off a mask grafted to your face (including blood) but that's only for the first awakening
spoilers for later || she does get to learn Starlight Breaker at least ||
well, the thing is that || Nanoha nearly died in a previous incident, think it's mentioned ||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo-lZSp4oog
the fire scene in A's and befriending Teana
(other than her design  feeling like a Gundam design)
oh yea and i think by now you see one  reason why fans call Nanoha the White Devil
that's a spoiler for later
she has a second one but...
Gaogaigar-tan is one of her fan nicknames
oh and Subaru's also a Gaogaigar reference, not a vehicle but yea
yep
ok, he is one too https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferrari_612_Scaglietti
i think Jail is one too but idk for sure
Erio and Caro dont seem to be references
Lutecia: Renault Megane (in her surname)
Teana: Nissan Teana
Subaru: Nakajima Aircraft Company (which today is called the Subaru Corporation, from what i found that's what she's referencing; both names make up her name and surname)
welp have the vehicle references then, that i recall
ah
what ep you at?
it wasnt bad, but it wasn't as captivating, that's the main issue with StrikerS, it kinda lacks focus
i paused by like episode 5 or 6 temporarily to watch the first recap movie instead
for me the first half was a bit harder to get through
glad to see you're enjoying StrikerS
YEP. || Vivio gets 2 moms. ||
probably ex-arm from what little ive seen
idk if this or RWBY (outside of the Monty fights) is worse
(the gif)
ex-arm?

(|| Rinne did nothing wrong ||)
havent gotten to it yet but i know about ***that*** scene
and Vivid Strike alongside Vivid (the Vivid anime also doesnt fully adapt the manga)
yea
the movie timeline which is 2 recap movies for S1 and A's + Refle-
anyways, after you finish StrikerS, you got 2 main choices basically apart from other material like games/mangas/sound stages/etc.
(had to brb a bit)
i wont elaborate further since i put it in spoilers
it aint in StrikerS
i got into the series recently and im enjoying what i saw so far quite a bit
btw tell me if im chatting too much about Nanoha with you
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEYDLeXOlX4
oh and i forgot another fun part to post earlier alongside the Vivio faceplant
StrikerS is flawed but it's not bad, there's definetly some noteworthy good in it as well that's worth staying for if you can get to it
yea
episode 1 i fully enjoyed, i liked Subaru and Teana in action for the first time, it felt fresh, the combat animation got better too (it's a little more dynamic than previous seasons, though the 4 movies still have even better animation)
i did still enjoy the first instances that showed what type of characters they'd be (personality, combat style, etc.)
i get that these are newbies but it does get a bit stale even with hints scattered throught those first few episodes (with the mystery of the drones and all)
like the training, you get quite a few episodes of it and of some worldbuilding, not just the first 1-2 episodes but like 5, before the train mission which is where the series begins gradually building up to the main meat of the plot by introducing Jail
it initially focuses quite a bit on things that in the long run dont end up mattering as much
like i said before the main issue is the lack of focus
if you still feel like continuing, it's worth it
yea
(yes, i know about the filler)
i prefer series personally, for both S1 and A's
even tho i found the first half a bit of a slog
*imo
but StrikerS was ultimately worth it in  the end im
A's here
so Subaru's other fan nickname is Lezbot.
her sister too
Subaru is a cyborg
yeah.
oh yea has it been mentioned what exactly Subaru is yet?
things get crazy now.
yeah.
check <#447132690349555712> for a cool remix i found
well turns out it was nothing so im already back but all i forgot to say was that Hayate-Carol might work better (both even have minions) but Miku matches better personality-wise
cya
gtg
https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/254970110329094145/887516694803804280/Signum_Tangled.jpg
brb
wait im pretty sure there was Maria-Signum fanart too
Maria definetly goes with Signum (both even have whip swords)
but personalitywise she easily would go with Chris
nah, none of the geahs use hammers or axes
so how about Erio instead,  he uses a polearm too
Kirika would normally go with Fate since both use scythes but Tsubasa works better, yknow, Nana wills it
maybe
Shirabe...idk.
Chris i'd pair with either Nanoha considering the above or Teana
id personally pair Hibiki with Subaru instead but, yknow, it's Nanoha that's the MC
who would you pair the rest with?
aye
though from the sound of it the only characters in it were the main trio
wasnt there a Nanoha XDU crossover?
yknow, both are mad scientists
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
also, im curious how Ver and Jail would get along
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zezUiAUp0j4
anyways, enjoy the movies, and have this funny eyecatch i forgot to post after you finished A's
think of it like Code Geass with its own recap movies that changed some stuff, then sequels to the recaps
but yea, that's what the movie timeline is
yep
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
yes, the Wild Arms/Symphogear one
Kaneko worked on at least one of the games too
and speaking of Ref/Det, they also use some elements from 2 Nanoha games (you dont need to check em out first since the movies do their own thing with those elements, but some fans have recommended me to check the games so check em out too when you want), Battle of Aces and Gears of Destiny
the recap movies are also implied to be TSAB-sponsored in-universe biography movies too iirc, which puts some of the changes in an interesting perspective
as for the movies, it's the S1 and A's recaps (they also have commentary tracks from the characters you can check out later but they feature characters from Vivid/Vivid Strike i think so there might be spoilers for those in the commentary), then Reflection and Detonation with their own plots but they are in the movie timeline
yea, the music is great
what are you going for next? movies or  Vivid/Vivid Strike?
glad to hear
i think there's an eng patch but im not sure, havent gotten to them yet; might probably also find translations on youtube maybe
<:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
ISAAAAYAAAAAAAAAMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
ahem ahem
i didnt bother checking but...it's even got nfts?
....wait.
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
why am i hearing a bird saying TATAKAE next to my window
hey
also, Precia is slightly more sympathetic. slightly. still don't forgive her but it's a nice new spin on her character, she's a little more fleshed out (along with the whole family and their familiars in general)
remember what i said about the recap movies being implied to be in-universe biographical movies sponsored by TSAB? think about what a more sympathetic portrayal of Precia implies regarding Fate's involvement in the creation of the movie
also, from what i recall hearing about the commentary track for the movie, during the abuse scenes, Fate apparently tries to downplay it, saying stuff like Precia was making sure her wounds could still be healed with magic (even though some of the abuse gets so bad that Fate is flat out knocked unconscious by the pain and the S1 anime shows scars on her back)
glad to hear you like it, i personally prefer the anime but mostly just due to me checking it out before the movies, the movies are also great
movie 1st as you've seen trims out the Triangle Heart/Lyrical Toy Box leftovers (which does mean also removing some Nanoha moments which i found interesting since those happen to be sprinkled with the leftovers, and less involvement from Yuuno in teaching Nanoha since he ends up unimportant later, though he wasnt in prototype materials like the leftovers) and, on the flipside, adds content from side materials (like from  the sound stages where there's more backstory for Fate)
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
|| or Hayate not wanting that part in the movie ||
|| means its TSAB damage control for his stunt lol||
yea, the || Graham subplot is cut out completely ||
nice
ah
though underutilized like a few other characters
Arf was nice
its the aftermath where Arf tries convincing Fate that it's fucked up and she continues to not mind it
but the whipping isnt the worst part
yea, it's gutwrenching
really liked the content the movie added for the Testarossas
yeah, she's more fleshed out while still being enough of a hatesink
just for base form like i said, if it's a later form then by all means go crazy if needed
also the color placement is better imo, the red ribbon does a good job to spice up the color scheme
though for her base form in the recaps i prefer the anime one, yea its less armored but it flows better on her imo
welp it seems to be an upgrade so, fine by me if it's more spiced up
this one?
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/590/793/ac6.gif
ive seen that design in passing
some are luckier and stay at least moderately noteworthy while others lose relevance
i like character arcs as well but when the arc is over there's not much left to do with some
wont comment on Ret/Def since i havent gotten to them yet like i said but i know they partially reuse some stuff from the games (at least one of which, like i said, had Kaneko working on it)
good to know you finished the movies too
(and others)
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Code Geass, JoJo, Lyrical Nanoha, Hellsing
nice available choices in the tiermaker
nice chris neso

(i found 6 okay too tbh, not outright good but decent enough after v5)
was one for me at first too until 7 was my dealbreaker (though i have gradually lost faith in it starting with 5 with how bad it was)
yeah, that's fine
sorry for jumping to conclusions then
ah
what, you got a problem with me not praising the show in everything i say about it?
i have
those arent small blips, they're v5 levels of stupid that shouldnt have been repeated if they truly learned from their mistakes
even if RWBY actually gets and stays good later, just too late for me
just not worth sticking for me, if Miles and Kerry dont want to have a good payoff even in a new arc where they can learn from their mistakes (which they should have done after the travesty that was V5) then there's no point in me continuing to follow their work, simple as that
nah, i found 7 shit and from what i heard of 8 and seen in vids (scenes if you're curious, not reviews) its even worse
EIGHT. FUCKING. YEARS.
its baffling how even after EIGHT GODDAMN YEARS Miles and Kerry cant fucking write/direct something good that makes sense, even with two new writers helping out.
yea....
(besides it's not like it's hard to make something better than RoosterTeeth have tried to do in 8 damn years <:ChrisAngry:336656958272700417> )
i hate RWBY these days...but i think i can make an exception for this.
https://tenor.com/view/kyoko-madoka-magica-pmmm-happy-dance-gif-19369480
god.
my.
oh.
Urobuchi.
Gen.
...
what
uh
read the manga
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/113/073/bdf.png
Jojo is gud shit
and as for 6 im waiting for all of it
i heard the part 5 netflix subs were meh
also worse subs, possibly
even if you get to binge em
its pain waiting so long for more eps
i miss the old schedule
wow
this starts from Beacon?
wait
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wLNEVGg3Jeg
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
thats just cope
besides manga readers already know the only good reason to keep paying attention is to || see the reaction of the anime-onlies to the garbage ending ||
and..apparently a movie from what i heard
part 2
part 1
same
though if i dont have time i skip
especially if its good
most of the time
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jfAbX-Fg9N0
oh yea, the music is also good
unless im mistaking it for someone else
same
i recall hearing something about someone involved with AOT defending imperial japan or something like that
unless its another author
true but i recall hearing something about Isayama having some shit takes on the past?
i didnt mind the both sides-ing but what i did mind was the bad portrayal of the apparent idea that evil can breed more evil
|| imagine thinking that the world would just leave Paradis be after what Eren did lmao ||
cuz AOT just had uh..ex-nazis that go nazi again partially, nazis again but backed by vengeance against the ex-nazis, and other countries....that also do nazi-esque shit to the ex-nazis; and yknow it wasnt done that well
hopefully theres less problematic subjects in his next work
|| you mean where Paradis gets exterminated anyways right ||
even though it doesnt fix the idiocy that lead up to it
yea, it makes more sense
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
|| Eren be like: "I just keep moving forward, until my enemies are destroyed" "Mikasa, i've always hated you"
Eren also be like after killing 80% of the world's population (that's how much he got to kill, right? or was that just what he intended to do): "10 MORE YEARS AT LEAST" ||
and i have recently checked the rest of the plot out of curiousity for the memeing on the ending
i checked it a little bit back when the anime came out due to the Guren no Yumiya memes
oh
when did you stop?
|| (not Yeagerist here btw) ||
|| (i do know the Yeagerists die in an apparently more pathetic manner in the manga, where as the anime keeps at least some determined even if they die) ||
MAPPA will give it a bit of lipstick (metaphorically) but theyre not making massive changes
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
Code Geass
any particular genre or type you want?
hm
yknow i wonder how much more timeline fuckery is possible considering the paths/attack titan stuff lmao
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wazD0RmRZho
that's just cope
but yea the part stuff is annoying
unless it was another studio
they also recently did that Yasuke anime iirc
ah
(i stumbled across **that** Rinne scene from Vivid Strike)
ye, though from what im hearing even the Vivid stuff (at least Strike) has its dark parts (im not there yet)
yea but at the same time Force was more serious from what i can tell
bk, didnt have time to mention that iirc its at least hinted she comes back but yea
**ahem ahem** killing Signum **ahem ahem**
and a few eh ones, at least at first glance (havent checked it yet)
yea
shame about Force
yea uh...
and some worldbuilding and slow buildup to the main plot
first eps had multiple ones
yea, but it wasnt the only training scene
Caro
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zo-lZSp4oog
yeaaa
for the newcomers
yea, yknow, the early training
well i said by ep 6 so i was having issues before Vivio was introduced
its less mechanical yea but the red breaks up her color scheme so nicely
wish the later Nanoha designs kept the ribbon
yea
i didnt think it was bad but i was finding it hard to stay focused on StrikerS
i even took a break by like ep 6 to watch movie 1st
especially in the first half
when it gets good, it's great, but it can be a slog to get there
shame that StrikerS had less focus again
yea
S1 has a charm imo and once Fate is introduced the plot gets going nicely but A's has the more solid plot from start to finish for sure
A's is solid honestly
also iirc shes more expressive in her last fight against Nanoha, she seems legitimately pissed off at parts from what i recall
since it packs side content with her backstory in it
tbh movie 1st does Fate even better than the anime
i find some things neat about the anime despite some being bundled with early installment weirdness (which i didnt mind personally)
i like both but im more used to the anime since i started with that
movies or anime for you?
i liked her being friends with Nanoha and her fight by the end
she had some moments in StrikerS too
yea
(AND HE DOESNT EVEN HAVE A DEVICE)
(iirc he manages to hold off Vita, a heavyhitter, a bit in A's)
Yuuno has some cool moments occassionally as well
nvm
well, pretty much everyone who ends up unimportant after their main arc
tho some are a bit too underused to be noteworthy enough to be favorites
yea
Vita and Signum are my fav wolks
Signum's cool though
(my pfp)
Fate
fav character ghost?
i like ep 3 of early s1 since it contributes to Nanoha's motivation
maybe the latter considering even Yuuno got teased once or twice but they definetly changed their minds after s1 if so
welp i like NanoFate soo i dont mind
i forgot if that was a hint for their original natures
oh yea there was that one part in A's where Alisa and Suzuka saw Nanoha and Fate in combat
idk if Fate is the best example, havent bothered with it tbh
and it does its own thing with prototype concepts
since its just Lyrical Nanoha as the separate branch
WAY less complicated
but yknow
(the franchise)
it's like Fate with deviating branches, right?
not complicated tbh
well anime doesnt even fully adapt it iirc
well afaik theyre their own thing so i dont consider them necessary but it is where Nanoha comes from
i see TH and LTB
ooh, including prototypes too?
good though
tokusatsu
its liveaction tho
ah
with Madoka inbetween the first 2 i guess as another mahou shoujo
for me it was Kamen Rider -> Symphogear -> Nanoha
https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/newsfeed/001/356/091/567.gif
another fan?
welcome aaron
especially with the modernized movies
yea, i dont mind the early visuals and i think they even have some ocassional highlights (mostly atmospheric ones thanks to colors) but they havent aged well
i guess you can at least ship him with Stern
and Yuuno also says hes not that interested at the end of A's when asked if he's into Nanoha
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEYDLeXOlX4
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
and the jerks no longer being jerks i think
well not exactly nostalgia but yea
same
and its own thing
no but ik its lighthearted
tbh A's is geniunely solid
im curious what they'd be like if they meet
yea
more than i can say for the rest of the side characters from previous material
though the wolks had their moments in StrikerS ocassionally
once the main arcs are done the side characters tend to be less present
yea
(yknow, a boisterous heavyhitter, against a kid that doesnt even have a device)
helping Nanoha escape TSAB to help out Fate against their wishes and holding back Vita a bit in A's
Yuuno also had a few moments
Arf was great in S1
yea
ik
i like NanoFate but i dont hate the fella
https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/254970110329094145/943270635466002512/tumblr_pa6cdfMYIT1skdbiao1_500.jpg
Yuuno's cool
i think if not S1  then A's is where the yuri started
A's ED has "my love" in the  lyrics soo
sound stages i think it was
doesnt some side material try to lean more into NanoYuuno from what i heard?
yea, ep 7 hit hard
not into idols either
even though i partially grew up with one or two
sports anime isnt usually my cup of tea
anything really
or, well
or that
<:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
(at least a StrikerS remake or remake series?)
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
more nanoha content pls
with more flash
seems like a sports anime
ye
starring totally-not-Hayate
oh yea, Extreme Hearts
but geah is still good
tbh i actually like Nanoha even more than geah
since the rest, while also neat, lose attention fast after their main arcs
i like the characters but the highlights are the main ones obviously
and partially in <#336297674707828747>
been having a long Nanoha discussion in here
yea
been a bit slow with getting into new stuff recently for various reasons
yea, heard about it
liked movie 1st but i  was more used to the anime so pacing felt odd
A's
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
But with the trademark twintails
Looks like a cross between the actual one and Sinon tbh
<:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Miku Hatsune?
Wait
I like both
I havent jumped on the SxF hypetrain
I think i only posted like one
Oh
Nanoha (the anime, which is older than the movies) isnt even from the 90s
Cool but i dont see what its gotta do with my question to kotoko
Saw it before
Anime or movies?
Yea, saw above
So dont worry, its not bad
(I actually prefer the anime over the movies but the movies are also good and i did start with the anime)
S1 has some early installment weirdness, nothing horrible imo but ik some people think it affects the pacing
Well if you find the pacing weird for s1 then also try out the movie
Ah
You watching the anime or the movies?
Ik
Anime or movies?
Nice
Ah
Gonna go in 1 hour or so (maybe less), in case you want to discuss more about the series as you watch
Ah
Then appears later once and thats about it
Its also in every s1 episode title iirc (maybe apart from 7 for...certain reasons)
Nantoka means "something" or similar
Its a running gag
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Btw her actual name is Nantoka
True
Oh and also || Fate || later...especially || when Fate isnt willing to discuss at first ||
Oh, must have forgot
Yes but as ferret
(And hes an alien)
I mean hes not a device sooo
The real question is how she manages to communicate with Yuuno
https://tenor.com/view/dungeons-and-dragons-dungeon-master-magic-gif-17932644
I just assume its telepathy so Nanoha understands it even if its an alien (not-English) language
And they also are POV songs
Yukari Tamura sings the ED (Nanoha's VA)
Oh btw Nana sings the op
Ah
How much do you plan on watching today?
But on the flipside the movies add their own content in other places, so check em out too, theyre worth checking out
Even tho theres more filler you do get a little more characterization for Nanoha in the original anime
First 3 eps are basic but ep 3 in particular does help establish Nanoha's motivation, which gets left out alongside the first 3 eps by people who dont like how they affect the pacing
And neither is...someone youll see later
Oh and Yuuno isnt from there, hes new
But yea
Yea, you dont need to check TH or LTB, Lyrical Nanoha is its own thing
Then LTB got redone into Lyrical Nanoha that grew into its own, much bigger thing
Then Lyrical Toy Box as a prototype spinoff that focuses on Nanoha (who is just a minor character in TH)
Theres Triangle Heart, specifically the third installment
Also the focus on Nanoha's family and friends is due to the franchise being a spinoff of another
And just gets better
But ep 4 spices things up onward a bit
First 3 eps are a bit basic and are monster-of-the-week
What do you think so far overall?
Dont mind it i guess, probs telepathic understanding despite alien language
Uhh...
Hows progress on your watch btw
And some fanart makes it either outright brown or red, or too close to those
Its a specific color inbetween brown and red, but not completely one of those 2
Fanart sometimes doesnt get her hair color right
|| i forgot does Fate say her name in ep 4 or 5? Since, yknow, shes not in the mood to talk with Nanoha at first ||
You'll see why
Shes a nice character
Yes
And the one voiced by Nana Mizuki
Shes in the opening too btw
But yea, uh, new character
It had those i think
Next ep preview right?
Things are gonna start getting more interesting now
A monster that messes up the city, obviously Nanoha doesnt want more incidents like this
Well, now you see that one part i like about ep 3
You at the jewel seed monster?
Ep 4?
?
The songs are under King Records btw, same as Symphogear
Opening is called Innocent Starter
Alright
Thats the name
Look up Little Wish
Oof
Like i said, things gradually get more interesting starting with ep 4
Nice
How was s1?
Yo
They finished s1
Ye
What do you think?
Welp
Same singers (Nana Mizuki and Yukari Tamura)
Opening is called Eternal Blaze, ending is called Spiritual Garden
Alright
Already starting huh? Thought youd start later
Spooky
Think of it as GX but for Nanoha and two times longer, takes a while to pick up the pace but its not horrible and does have good in it
Some do find its issues a dealbreaker though so its understandable if you end up not liking StrikerS
Its also a bit slow in the first half, but its worth getting through it to get to the good stuff
So you need more time to finish that one
Oh and ill also warn you about StrikerS (season 3), its two times longer than the previous 2 seasons (not combined)
The plot is solid both in the anime and the movie and with no early installment weirdness like s1, helps that the franchise found its footing by introducing Fate and focusing on her instead of the jewel seeds
At least most fans ive seen think so
A's is basically the best that the franchise has to offer
Ah
Im not as familiar with the prototype or the TH franchise but i prefer Fate
Started as a spinoff yknow
Chrono is from there too, he's Nanoha's rival and i think even ends up with her
And another fun fact: Fate is kinda what Chrono used to be in Lyrical Toy Box, the prototype i mentioned earlier
Fate (and by extension Precia) = Ferrari Testarossa
Presea/Precia = Nissan Presea
Yuuno = Mazda Eunos (possibly)
S1 has just Fate and Precia (and possibly Yuuno but its not clear enough)
Nanoha likes vehicle references
Its a car
Ferrari Testarossa
Testarossa
Did you notice anything familiar about her family name?
Oh yea and speaking of Fate...
They help with checking out some side content too since the movies implement it, the s1 movie for example adds more content for Fate and her family
I prefer the anime but its just preference, movies arent bad
Modernized visuals, more dynamic battles, new content despite some cuts to streamline the plot (yknow, remove the filler, get straight to the point)
Theyre worth checking out
Its a fully-fledged nuke, not even nerfed by the water like the original
Yea
(Im linking this since its the only one i found so far on YouTube, yknow, copyright and all like with Symphogear songs)
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UUzdIxj9nM
Its called Take a Shot
You heard her first when she comes back to her senses after the....other gutwrenching reveal (what she really is and why she has a strange name)
Oh yea and Fate also gets theme songs from time to time apart from the openings sang by her VA
|| Think of Reinforce's Starlight Breaker, that's what its like in the movie ||
Forget the above if you saw the pic
Me? No
Its bigger
Yes
The movie version is even more devastating
Well understandable
Oh
Dont spoil em on || Vivio ||
Delete
Its less shameless than Symphogear but yes, NanoFate is a thing
Oh and in one case the victim of Starlight Breaker ends up as her wife
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4Xk4BRQqDg
The one she finishes off Fate with in their final duel
Starlight Breaker is the big one, the ultimate attack
Nanoha shoots a giant laser, usually Starlight Breaker, and the enemy sometimes ends up her friend
You also got to see what the "befriending" is, if you heard about it from a Nanoha fan
Poor Fate
Got dark pretty fast didnt it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
You get the TSAB reveal and then...the Precia reveal.
...and culminates starting with 7.
As you saw...it gets gradually more interesting with ep 4
And probably also my chatting about A's even tho that's as kotoko's watching rather than from later
I assume you meant the || Vivio || spoiler from earlier
Sorry as well
<:KirikaTired:688429723726250054>
Well kotoko move to <#377148557796442134> i guess
I think that was above
|| Fate getting whipped ||
A few are id say
Uh
She seems a bit taller because she wears heels
Yes
Shes the 2nd shortest of the team, just BARELY taller than || Shirabe ||
Chris is tiny as well
Idk
For reasons
Also do not touch the hat
At least in terms of demeanor since its Fate who got the fucked up backstory
Think of Chris but...a bit...different.
Meet Vita
But things are fine
And yea, Fate and Arf still had to deal with TSAB due to working for Precia (even when Fate is just a kid)
Especially if it involves Yuuno
Chrono, as serious as he is does in fact have a sense of humor
Ah
Nice
Well internationally its Amazon afaik
Same

AOE theory is pure cope btw
Ending sucks so its understandable if MAPPA wants to delay the inevitable
...actually, no, milk it MAPPA
"The final season, forreal now"
Oh god
Though i know OFA getting new abilities (granted, from past users, stockpiled power and all) instead of just having Deku gradually become All Might-tier and higher bothered some people
As far as i saw while nothing outstanding MHA seemed pretty good for a popular shonen
Like, went on for so long and people are kinda getting burned out by it?
I havent seen it for myself after US Smash but it seems MHA is a case of hype burnout?
And OFA evolving
Oh and the theories about Dabi being proven true
(So im aware of the crazy shit Shigaraki gets into and AFO's return)
Then occassionally read up on the plot for more updates
Ngl i zoned out after AFO's first fight

BERSERK IS BACK
One of my first animes
Trigun? Noice
Oh shit i forgot about Maruki
Iirc he voiced Josuke in the part 4 dub if you need an example
RIP
Oh and Full Metal Alchemist
Another one might have been Hellsing (the OG anime, not Ultimate, ive seen Ultimate later)
Inuyasha, Yu-Gi-Oh (dubbed so idk if it counts), YYH is what i recall for sure from back then
Was one of my first anime
So i forgot quite a bit of stuff
I watched it but its been a long time
Need to recheck it again sometime, been a long time
Hakusho gud
Ye
MAPPA's doing us a favor
Like i said
As frustrating as it seems at first glance
MAPPA is doing us a favor by dragging it out
Trust me
|| basically making Armin's alliance and Eren's shoehorned Lelouching be all for nothing, it makes sense to have a grim ending like this for Attack on Titan, of-fucking-course the world wont let Paradis get off easy after what Eren pulled off, but having Armin and the others and Eren acting this stupid in the first place makes no sense ||
Yea Isayama released some extra pages
|| thats why i say MAPPA is doing us a favor by dragging out the final arc ||
(AOT manga spoilers) || Eren pulls a Lelouch. After commiting mass genocide on everyone outside Paradis. But it's apparently ok cuz just 80% died and the alliance beats him so Paradis will look good supposedly...only for the rest of the world to exterminate Paradis in revenge for what Eren did lmao ||
|| oh and iirc the tree Ymir found in the past pops up again where Eren's head is buried lmao ||
Oh it is
CBR
Lemme guess
...cant be worse right?
My patience has ran dry too, but i am willing to give Shaft a chance
"More of a mentor, actually."
-Blake Belladonna, Volume 2
That too
Despite the mishandled faunus racism idea coming from early RWBY
And until v4 its at the very least a potential guilty pleasure
And my opinion is negative admittedly.
....theyre a thing. To say the least. Bit divisive for various reasons
Well...the later seasons are a bit...uh...
Ah
Thats what it basically is
Energy shield and source for Semblances and cool/stylish attacks and superhuman movement
And ultimately it either doesnt answer all of your potential questions or makes you ask new ones
Then have to do it AGAIN like 2 or 3 more seasons later.
Dont forget that, in the original show, even 5 seasons later they still have to explain Aura and Semblances, two BASIC concepts of the franchise
But yea, speeding hard through early RWBY is what i heard
I moved the convo to the spoiler channel
Ah
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyub4gmO8LU for anyone curious
Alright, enough RWBY trashtalking in here for now
Companion book for example says || that Cinder controlled the Wyvern Grimm...through the Fall Maiden powers. So hold up, Maidens can control Grimm apparently? Then what's stopping Raven from doing the same? Oh and keep in mind that Cinder is a half-human half-Grimm hybrid. Cinder HAS a Grimm in her body. How is Grimm infestation apparently NOT what allows Cinder to influence Grimm? ||
And in terms of shaky canon, look up the companion book and some of what it says, apparently its canon but some of the stuff in it seems to contradict what the show SEEMS to be implying? I get it, different from expectations, but RWBY isnt being different and still being good, it's just being confusing, nonsensical and, in some cases, outright infuriating
Ah, forgot, didnt care much for Genlock in the first place
Just something good, enjoyable, honest, with integrity
Im no Monty's plan person but it could definetly have turned out better, especially to do Monty's brainchild justice for his sake now that he's gone, may he rest in peace
While RWBY is still going but RT just...doesnt seem to care for it enough
Genlock seemed meh and S2 was apparently recieved even worse (and i do recall Gray doing some shitty stuff to get Genlock going but i forgot the specifics), RVB Zero seems to have also failed
RT bit off more than they could chew and RWBY suffered for it even if it's the only still-going big show they got
Yea, understandable
Just see what you like unless you want to waste time and attention just to end up confused
Tbh OG RWBY's canon is already shaky to begin with due to mismanagement sooo
Its on my to-check list
https://tenor.com/view/lets-go-lets-goo-lest-gooooooooooooooooo-gif-19416648
Holy shit
Yo yo yo
K
So XHearts is just...average so far basically
Both have the same creator
The joke is that one of the Extreme Hearts MCs looks exactly like Hayate Yagami from Lyrical Nanoha but the eyes are a lighter blue
Or watch Nanoha if you want some context on totally-not-Hayate
Hm, ok
...when it came out in the 90s
so somehow Cardcaptor Sakura exists in the 80s in Higurashi...
Ooh
Idk those vns will already take a lot to do and im more in the mood to spend time on them
Then after those i got some other stuff on my list
Too busy reading vns currently
Naruto
20th anniversary of Higurashi today apparently
(Including the part where he ends up with Nanoha apparently)
Chrono did though and he's basically proto-Fate in LTB afaik
Fate, Yuuno, Hayate, Wolkenritter, etc also didnt exist
Yet because of good ol executive meddling you get this
Thats what i hate, its an opportunity to evolve
Im used to cable but streaming is normally more convenient
It aint, yes
Plus the risks like overheating
That would be convenient but knowing humanity you bet its gonna be twisted into cyberpunk shit if it happens
If you want a preserved copy for yourself? Not possible, you dont spend money to have a copy for yourself, you spend money to obtain the privilege to take a look at whatever content they feel like putting on there. They want the content gone? If its only on that service, its GONE.
Stability of service? Nope, look at the recent fuckups on basically every service
Instead of one convenient service? Multiple services because corporate capitalist circlejerk where everyone decided to compete with Netflix with their own exclusives
Streaming services are such a fucking failure.
Gargoyles creator also worked on season 2 iirc if youre familiar with that
Theyre pretty different tho (show was an adaptation but only the main plot ideas were carried over, the rest was different, not necessarily for better or for worse tho, also show only got to adapt the first 2 arcs out of 11)
Theres also comics if youre curious
Saw it
Yo, throwback time
SHYMPHOGYYYEEEEAAAAAAAAAAAAH

<:ChrisBored:672575526346424351>
Ye, good OP
Yep
Oh and what did you think of ep 7? Yknow what i mean
Like the series so far?
Any parodies that use Rinbu Revolution?
Uhh i guess i did check the Utena opening sooo
I see
Plus after that ill either be watching Utena or Shakugan no Shana before it, or even something else if i get other ideas in the meantime, again, will take a while to get to that point
Though it will take a while to get to it since im reading some stuff first, pretty long stuff
Didnt watch Utena yet either, but its on my to check list
Oh, similarities and same director
What does Utena have to do with Gundam
Nice
Well, if youre counting getting into When They Cry as that (and possibly Higanbana and Rose Gun Days if i don't do some animes first)
Been getting more familiar with vns recently
I did mean vn
Ik its a vn too
Heard muv luv is good
Another for the to-check list once im done reading some stuff
Hm, ok
At least Edgerunners seems promising and the game seems to be in a...decent state these days. Especially with mod tools out apparently and possibly reinvigorated interest thanks to Edgerunners
Bloody hell CDPR
Didnt pre-order, even stuff im hyped for cant convince me these days for that, but had high hopes
I was hyped for Cyberpunk sadly
I prefer Geass series without Ressurection
Yea, jumped ship since i didnt want to deal with something that bothered me anymore
And even once im done with WTC i have a few other things on my to check list with higher priority
Yea, mostly same, only IQ i might check out
But yea, heard of Ice Queendom, heard its at least ok, im interested to check it out but again, busy with When They Cry these days
interesting
<:HibikiThink:688429715362414641>
AWAKEN MY MASTERS
https://tenor.com/view/jojo-bizarre-adventure-gif-11387564
Stick with the vn when it comes to muv-luv?
Lemme guess
Yea, like i said, pacing imo
Yea, A's anime is solid
As for Vivid and Vivid Strike do those after StrikerS, basically mandatory for those 2
But again, if you cant go through s1, try out movie 1 instead either way and you can try out the A's anime if you wanna go to StrikerS or the A's movie if you wanna go to Ref/Det
StrikerS fits best with series
And yes theyre not adults yet like in StrikerS
Ref/Det fit best with the movies
Only on StrikerS
Didnt mind those on S1 strangely (to the point where i like the series more than the movies, but again, movies are good too and they do add bonus content to some of my favorites)
Especially if you dont like s1's slower pacing and early installment weirdness
Theyre fine too
No
I had trouble getting through the first half (took a break to watch the movies)
You might also not like the pacing
Its two times longer
Make sure you get time for StrikerS if you start
Then possibly some other animes after that
Im busy with reading actually
Will take a while if i get back, busy with a long franchise these days and got some other possible stuff on my list after that
No
Havent seen it yet, moved to other stuff after StrikerS, but i heard its good
Even though i prefer Fate overall
Hayate's cool too, also has my favorite design
With brown hair and the spooky book
The one that debuts in A's
My fav is obvious
Btw fav character everyone?
Cool
But thats what was recommended to me, movies if i wanna go to Ref/Det next, series (at least A's) if i wanna go to StrikerS next
Been a while
They seem to kinda, yea
First half is a slog
The fucking Angel Mort outfit
Beako
I heard yea
I heard Sotsu was meh so idk
I did pretty good when it came to Higurashi's mystery, but again, Umineko gets intense fast even before the presumably upcoming big moment
Yea
Doing it for others
Arc 1 so dont worry
Mild
|| UWOOOOOOAAAAAAH BEATORICHEEEEEEEEE ||
Oh and also an old geezer simping
1 here
As soon as you get on Rokkenjima you keep getting stuff to think about, plus drama
Yea, Umineko seems like an even more intense beast so far
Higurashi was great
Or at least manga, but vn is hard to beat imo so far
Im aware of vn-only for when they cry as well
Yeah, i heard
Will be busy for a while checking out something else
Welp, vn-only again i guess if i check it out
Already familiar with that recurring problem when it comes to some vn adaptations
Im not too familiar with muv luv currently but it seems like anime is lacking in comparison right
https://tenor.com/view/yare-good-grief-jotaro-kujo-gif-16255655
>tried the anime
Wasnt complaining, i can wait
Yea, yea, was saying it lightly
I guess ill try Higurashi side/sequel material or RGD or Higanbana instead
Oh yea progress on Ciconia halted cuz Silent Hill lol

Hows the anime been?
What detail? Im aware of the part 6 plot btw
I miss weekly JoJo fridays, way better to keep the hype going
Felt like waiting for everything to be out
funny pink girl
funny pink girl
Yep
Ah
Apparently the jokes are of the fake progressive sort, so desperate to look progressive (and as mentioned above its actually not) that it's unfunny, stereotypical and offensive but put there because a minority isn't the target
Seems so
...so basically the show is a terf's desperate attempt to look as progressive as possible...and it just falls flat on its face considering the former and the racist and stereotypical jokes (i don't give a shit what group is the target) i heard about
hoo boy
Really makes you think
Remember that the split is usually Fred-Daphne-Velma and Shaggy-Scooby
He just holds back most of the time because the show wouldnt be as fun otherwise
How's that not peak masculinity
Dude has a strong appetite, beats up bikers like theyre nothing when he's in the mood, and keeps up with a dog like Scooby (iirc his breed is a fast one)
What the fuck are you talking about
Not peak masculinity?
*misery machine
Maybe not the most accurate description but it rhymes
Yea, maybe made just for outrage lol
Fans seemed to dislike the liveaction anyways from what i recall seeing soo
Didnt check that one out and im not really familiar with winx other than "italian magical girl series"
Oh yea wasnt there a liveaction of it that apparently turned out meh?
MANGA ENDING? NO I DONT WANT THAT, I WANT MAPPA TO TEASE AOE FOR A LONG TIME, 10 YEARS AT LEAST
Just stumbled across it in some other place then saw the discussion here so
Oh
Sometime in february on crunchyroll
Also v9 release date has been announced if anyone's still interested
Thought it was about the upcoming one
Oh, your ideas
Oh, the rwby x dc crossover

https://tenor.com/view/battler-battler-ushiromiya-umineko-umineko-battler-gif-26294938
I. DIG. GIANT ROBOTS.
neat
A's is peak Nanoha imo
But it gets a bit better later
Starts out pretty slow honestly, first half was a bit of a slog to get through and i even paused like 6 eps in to watch movie 1st instead
Oh hey StrikerS, with proto-Chris (...i mean Fate kinda counts as that too in some regards but whatever) and proto-Hibiki
Its pretty good
But check those after Vivid/Strike and StrikerS cuz characters from there
Oh and they also have commentary tracks
Yea so (Nanoha A's) || cutting out Graham can be considered TSAB propaganda i guess ||
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEYDLeXOlX4
oh and uh have this i guess
like i said, took a break after the first quarter to watch movie 1st instead
Its neat at first to showcase the newcomers but it gets old fast after that
Yea, lotta boring training
You now understand why early StrikerS is a bit of a slog to get through i see
