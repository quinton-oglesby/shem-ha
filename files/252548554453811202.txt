whatanime is only good for anime screenshots.
dont bother with tineye, baidu, yandex, karma decay, or imgops.

maybe just firefox then. oh damn. google only shows 4 engines.
<a:weebshrug:393608760725340160>
the extensions linked on this page should have ascii already.
https://saucenao.com/tools/
i got it for firefox.
saucenao doesnt search twitter though.
if it fails i try idbq and ascii, then google and bing.
thats my go to search.
never can remember whcih one though.
one of my search engines searches DA.
couldve been an avatar they drew for themselves just to be an avatar.
wouldnt surprise me. its 4chan.
so it wasnt anything useful.
same. it was someone's avatar.
<a:weebshrug:393608760725340160> no help sorry.
ive checked every reverse image search tool i have, and none worked.
where did you find the pic?
wa-ta-shi?

<:YuzuSurprise:414396163794403349>
MAID CHRIS!
guess i should also apologize. i mod a server mainly for posting pics, and tire of everyone asking for the source when saucenao and its extension are pinned, and recommended every time someone asks for source. it tends to bleed into other servers too.
<a:weebshrug:393608760725340160>
especially since you didnt paste it with a link, so you had to open it in browser to copy the image either way.
id consider opening in browser with a middle click and right click/search with saucenao easier than copying it into another server.
<a:weebshrug:393608760725340160>
because they dont know how to use saucenao themselves.
dont bother. wont read anything in this channel unless im activily talking, and i should be caught up tomorrow or thrusday.
kirika best dess.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
am i green now?
i plan to be caught up in time to watch saturday's episode.
ill probably fail.
i try.
all is fine again.
yes. im only on episode 3. ive been trying my damnest to catch up ive watched the first 4 seasons as fast they would download.
this is bullshit! where did her ears go!?!
it only means more people are enlightened to the superiority of mimis.
go ahead.

<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
im actually on track to catch up in time to watch episode 13.
if so, no one can be stronger. shounen laws.
isnt goku main character?
<:bellNaruhodo:338852564323926027>
but the lower half the symbol looks like the geass symbol.
idk what majin is.
were they taken over by geass?
this fights better than any of the fights with symphogears so far.
<:ThatOneEmote:372476787537608704>
but now miku is shem-ha.
it was clear it was headed here...
well fuck.
theres a reason horriblesubs picked their name.
doesnt really make a difference.
<a:weebshrug:393608760725340160>
im not spending 2 days downloading it all again.
get over it.

<a:weebshrug:393608760725340160>

dumbasses thinking  nukes can kill a god.

<:ChrisEmbarassed:336656400472080386>
