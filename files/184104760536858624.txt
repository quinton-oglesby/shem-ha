implying there's something more important than symphogear
ik ik
I invited them we're all XDU noobs
"peaceful"
mizuki nana is good civilisation <:meguhappy:388466195667615745>
Nice
i only have like slightly over 300 tsubasa pics
how do you even find so many
a huge nerf for some stuff tbh
same, heh
had to stop
i tried to listen to some symphogear music earlier and I almost started to cry
like, it's crystal clear they were going to say they loved each other
it's not that they left anything to imagination
I think that not showing it felt great and there was no need to explicitly saying it
not clear enough smh

F
but I could cut that
except when I broke into tears at the end
i regretted not recording my reaction to the episode, must have been funny
<:ehehehe:284826327398481921>
same but in Spanish
and just AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAing whenever something happened
between singing, cheering them on...
finished the episode with a sore throat
then again I screamed in almost every scene
I screamed in that scene so hard
