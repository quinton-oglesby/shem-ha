ive read an overview
NoWaYu
so how many people have read the pre-prequel to YuYuYu
the second point is one thing that really annoys me
as if either of them would go that far
figured
who are top right and botten left?
would watch that
reincarnated
there is speculation thats it the same person
which makes the art more intresting
its from twitter
<@246146781832806401>  found this of the r/anime FTF
im wondering if carol is going to be a major part now
given that they tended to write 1 season at a time im surprised there isn't more plotholes
i kinda hope ver shows up again
is this the first date with have for the series?
and 7 stars at the end
so the ed has what looks like leyline imagery and phonic gain channelers from G and episode 1
we've already seen the combos get set up
they don't seem to be baiting the OP this season based on AXZ
since elf9 has the memory thing on in the OP
custodians then?
ver is annoying
taking bets next episode cliffhanger is miku being kidnapped
at least CR is promoting it now
since i us GX and AXZ clips the lower budget puts people off
the hard part is s1
chances of a 6 henshin before the final episode?
GX was ignite reveal, AXZ was alchemist grand scheme reveal with axis no kaze
and GX
6 was in AXZ
and then tweeted after about there being more than 6 fans of it
gigguk made a joke about it in his devilman video
though this could be a good oppertunity for all the other gears to be hit by its cleansing beam
hence the ring
i saw someone of reddit speculating that its recreating the SSj relic
im kinda doubting the fudou plan is going to wa#ork now
thats the plot point for the next few episodes?
im really hoping that we are going to get a gear version once she is bikki punched
the X-drive really surpised me
i really want a divine power shared among all the gears
ðŸ˜¦
i was under the impression that the beam only hits relics
they don't need to have the relic on at that point?
there wasn't enough fodder for good scenes
also I was kinda disappointed
ive got the impression they are
so are the gear destroyed or not?
^ heard good things about it
leave I imagine
are we still doing this at all?
at home this weekend
i might not be able to make it
yep
they are 1 hour each
i binged hellsing ultimate
im talking about nier:automata
solves quite a few problems with the game
pinned post on steam forums
use the FAR mod to help
which run are you on?
there is a lot of reuse
they reuse the tutorial boss track for the final sections
but unless you look where it plays it fine
the only spoilly track is the bunker track
SEGA sucessfully  killing sonic more that it already is
np
should of made it clear
since we got 3 rares yesterday only 1 was raded
another is that we are more lucky with normal relic compared to radiant
i don't really think about in jokes
forgot that it was a personal thing
its a joke among my friends
<@181667252355989504> im only joking
