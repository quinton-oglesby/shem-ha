Sounds great üëç
and GX‚Äôs trailer featured was radiant force and AXZ used the OP ü§î
Although that was 3 months before the proper trailer in that case.
All good I think I answered my own question, AXZ had a short trailer very similar to the one we‚Äôve gotten.
I remember AXZ had one too
With the slow opening into team song
https://youtu.be/CLcpO8S8tvY
Are we expecting a trailer for XV in a similar format to these
Quick question
Love it
Incredible
Is that the new album art style?
You have now been T-posed into submission

<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
Is it trailer time yet <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Which I kind of understand, it looks weird and you‚Äôd have to watch 3+ seasons to catch up.
Gigguk doesn‚Äôt even mention any airing Symphogear seasons in his roundup.
Why XV discussion specifically. There‚Äôs so many channels I don‚Äôt go to that could be used for sharing those cursed gifs <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
and by well received I mean it had a fire opening scene like the rest
Do we know if it was well received?

Y‚Äôall talking about Hibiki being hurt but it‚Äôs Miku I‚Äôm worried about
Remind me when the show starts I've literally never used any of these

That spouse abuse though
~~what am I saying it‚Äôs statelight ofcourse they are lmao~~
Hopefully that doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre too stretched

They're already pretty fun.
Hope the new *villians* turn out to be helpful in the long run
I still remember the episode they introduced Ignite with Radiant Force, I got out of my chair and straight walked outside from intense Hype.
There's still wubs, and intense metal. Just not in it's purified essence.
Good and pure

We won't be getting Ignite remixes this season yeah?
Interested in hearing the full chorus in the release version
All for one was a great song too
Although some of the lines were pretty awkward from CR subs, I'd be interested in rewatching if someone else is doing some.
Just watched it, when Hibiki faced off against big rolly boy and the eurobeat starts pumping I teared a little



Tbf that spike from Coffin-kun would dunk a small planet
But the other 75% is absolutely frothing over the idea of one similar to G
25% of my body wants there to be no need for a training montage this season.
Elfnien's table is so extra lmao

Actually love Kirika, her duet with Hibiki in AXZ was so much fun. Great energy.
Christ, my brain tells me not to expect the same quality as Hibiki‚Äôs.

But if it is, it‚Äôs going to be so much fun.. and a little lewd in a green stripey kind of way.
Tradition dictates that it‚Äôll be a Maria Henshin next episode yeah?
Geez it‚Äôs almost the weekend

I want to see Milaarc take a firm Hibiki right
I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be the former
Or it could just be some random girl, which is also pretty damn sad above posts considering
The alternative is way too cruel, symphogear or otherwise
If it does turn out to be her, my only consolation is that she‚Äôll most likely somehow be revived. Like the season ends with a reverse thanos snap
and she was featured in S1 shots for XV promos
The hair and eye colour are *identical* though
You could save a life
If anyone has that art somewhere
Buff Kirika is dancing for Shirabe (I think there might have been a pole involved) and Shirabe is making it rain bills
Yall talking about Kirika's abs reminds me of the piece of art I've spent my life trying to find again

Modern art
Kirika‚Äôs thigh highs
Hibiki‚Äôs XV transformation is modern art
Inspiring
One piece was giant plastic bush with stickers of various Video cards slapped all over.
I went to the main modern art museum in Sydney

Imagine having Hibiki‚Äôs drama and still being this perfect
~~Do gears even get paid?~~
I would hope that multiple world savings would endow her with a free pass through whatever tertiary education she needed.
Jesus Christ I can‚Äôt believe we‚Äôre only two episodes through XV.. I feel like we‚Äôve already been through so much.
Miku handles her finances
Gears go through some shit
Better be fat pay checks
that's all I need
I sleep, I eat and I love my wife from the bottom of my heart
Can't have symphogear end without the culmination of her training

Our boy better finish teaching Hibiki how to fight Relics with her bare hands this season

Loved the use of Wild Bunch, never fails to bring hype
Even still, Elf9 shall be fucked about no longer
Just hope she doesn't job too hard next episode, best case scenario is she wipes the floor with red and gets blindsided by God-Miku resurrection
Honestly this episode was so much fun, autoscorers getting their send off with the hype tracks from GX in the background
https://pbs.twimg.com/media/ECL2NSTUYAAREBN.jpg
Everyone is seeing their significant other in dreams these days
Nah I just meant maybe Tsubasa would see Kanade in a vision or something
We can make this work
>6 min on-screen kiss
>isn't what Kanade would have wanted
>Maria breaks her out of it
>Sad Sword Zesshou
>Everyone is losing/ mass Innocents in danger again
I hope she's not planning on offing herself with a swansong in future battles ala her dear Kanade
Certainly came from a dark place
Tsubasa's smile from the PV though
I didn't mind the autoscorers being finished off so quickly, they were only scrap/spare parts. They had a hype last stand and a good send off by Elf9.
She's just gonna always be a dormant part of Elfnien
Not sure about all this dead carol stuff

There was actually heaps of fun Easter eggs in that website
But they have the episode names in the links so xd
I remember when GX was airing you could change the numbers in the image urls and you could get them an hour or so earlier

^ and also yeah
^yeah
I guess Dur Da Bla ruins pretty much any new song
The opening is fire though
One last thing is about Carol's new song, I dunno how much I like it. It seems really subdued like a few of the others this season.
*if i can even sleep from hype*
I need to have a nap before the next episode airs
Actually I am drunk the hair is totally similar
It was pretty blond
https://pm1.narvii.com/5869/5bc5de70597d422fb985e7e5561eef0fa74f1a21_hq.jpg
Did she dye it or something I can't remember
I just remembered, Elf9 had blond hair at the end of GX because she was using Carol's body
amirite
https://pm1.narvii.com/5869/33edd32ef35b7b22ff908733356c195c12fe619e_hq.jpg
I think Elf9 befriended her hard enough
also would mean awkward conversations would have to be had xd
and eeevvill
Anything else would feel like Carol is **really** back and able to hatch plans
Hmmm.. maybe more like Elfnien can occasionally hear Carol being snarky, but battle Elfnien is all Carol.
Sleep required
Mind blank
What's a good analogy
Nah I mean I'm happy for them to share the same body, just different personalities. Like uuuh..
I actually love that freeze frame of Carol, goddamn.

Carol is like
Yeah I dunno about Meshed, they feel like to different people at this point.
Someone needs to protec elf9
I just hope they don't get rid of her, I love Carol too. Just let her stay as a slightly more powerful Gear. Alt form for Elfnien.
https://www.symphogear-xv.com/next/next08_mikusansorosorodebandesuyookite/01@2x.jpg
I doubt she'll be as powerful as her final boss form, she'll still wipe the floor with Red though
I think the best service you can have for carol is her being "technically" on the good team but still a bad bitch amirite
I could go on
or maybe Yugi's Pharoh form
I'm fine with her being El9's dark jak form
I feel like Carol's arc was fairly closed
Custodians were among us the whole time D:
Nah they won't die this early, Carol is going to give them a spanking though
I want to see Carol throw Milaarc through a wall lmao, just how she through elf9 to the ground
Protec the floofy one
I wouldn't feel a iota of empathy if not for Elza
Like there's still a shell of Carol with her personality but no memories dormant inside elfy
There isn't much evidence otherwise apart from the "Don't look any further inside me" when Elf9 was being mind controlled.
`I'm still not entirely convinced Carol and Elfnein are separate apart from on a sub conscious level. I'm hoping that the person using Dur Da Bla is basically still entirely Elfnein. She's just finally being assertive.`

Hibiki's wife is looking mighty mean

Kanade really has it out for Tsubasa <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
Because he is the action hero dad
I‚Äôm.. strangely okay with Gen going out with a bang and motivating Hibiki. As much as I absolutely love him it‚Äôs one of the best services you can do with his character.
Haven‚Äôt had a training montage yet
Gen has to punch something
I mean geez, the final finale, tick off everything we need to happen.
So many things need to be covered if this is really the last season.
After last episode, 5 episodes feels like so much time but also not enough
Yeah I mean as far as screen time goes, she shines in the spotlight

Love her so much
Hope we haven‚Äôt seen the end of Carol being the big damn hero for the season
I could be wrong
My first watch was horriblesubs and I remember burial for some reason
Unless each spare body has the full personality and she feels for all of them
Like wouldn‚Äôt it be literally nothing for carol to rebuild them?
I didn‚Äôt like the ‚Äúgive them a good burial‚Äù scene

Continue but here‚Äôs some good girl Micha

Totally down for Genjurobowl
But the second option means Hibiki can learn it so I‚Äôm down for that <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>

Home stretch for the next episode

Topdad redeemed as the greatest anime dad of all time
Topdad helps Hibiki realise she's gay for Miku
I just pray to GodMiku that they handle this with some level of tact
Top dad isn't back with Hibiki's Mom yet is he, it's going to be really dicey how they handle his character
^ That unit made me feel a lot better
>Before previews
Man I'm super excited for next episode!
>After previews
Sweet fucking Jesus I am super apprehensive about next episode.

~~but we must preserve Elsa's floofy ears~~
With no blood and this poisoning being as bad as it is
I think Milaarc and Vanessa are probably going go to Hibiki to perhaps save Elsa as a last resort.
Since Noble Red is really damaged (possibly mortally?) and without any allies do you think they'll get so desperate that they'll try to find Hibiki as someone who offered her hand?
I feel the first half will be epic, but it's going to end with something so shocking that Hibiki needs an Adult
They picked quality screens from last episode

in my heart
Gen is Hibiki's dad
If Ver happens next episode as well it's going to be absolute anarchy
^Roger that
Fudou is most likely just as strong as Gen
GodMiku is so gorgeous

Sick floof
It's such a strange title and and title preview, hopefully it's just because this episode is battle of the dads
^It can happen, but they usually make it ambiguous 98% of the time for anything other than actual Romance media
I love that Fuudo face is shaking lmao
"I am a Father" - Topdad
Honestly the title just boggles the mind, actually painful if it's referencing Topdad because he was anything but a father to Hibiki
Topdad's advice eventually leads to Hibiki gaining the courage to kill Miku because she's endangering innocents
If Gen dies, Hibiki is getting his Movie watching powers. I will take nothing else.
Me posting this is probably useless to 70% of us here but I'm hoping there are also some high tier nippons present

Is that the Samuel L Jackson reference that was mentioned above?
Jpn accounts on twitter seem to spamming posts about the preview images alt-text
It would have cost you nothing to refrain from posting that

So many good Fuudo faces this episodes, actually a beast
Seriously though, I need subs because ||what the actual fuck happened to Elsa||

and the Gen character is a tough female version
With slightly different characters
and that something new will be Symphogear Sunshine
God-Miku will do anything to get her hands on this photo
We have our secret weapon
There‚Äôll be some revivals before the end, mark my words.

The rest are all g
Save Elsa
I like how Vanessa‚Äôs head made a metallic *clunk* when it hit the ground
Is but a flesh wound!
<:HibikiEager:407398049531559937>
When it‚Äôs Friday and you‚Äôre about to end it all but *you realise we‚Äôre hours away from Symphogear previews*
Those previews are such a whiplash of emotions
Doubt they can top Hero story for an insert song though
Keen
Nah they‚Äôre doing a training montage for sure
Yeah lmao ^
With that tape on Hibiki
But I‚Äôm hoping for a training montage
Nah it was just sexbot teasing Hibiki again
No bulli

Probably my favourite amalgam ngl
<:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
So much good Dess this episode
Nah Maria has to Amalgam first
You can watch it as it airs on streams or just spoil yourself via Twitter
~~Hibiki needs a side GF in case it doesn‚Äôt work out with God~~
So glad it‚Äôs Hibiki and Chris
Powerful Bikki
Going to miss Vanessa bullying Hibiki

I love the short amount of times between Previews and Airing, anarchy.
it's almost previews time
YOU KNOW WHAT TIME IT IS
Thanks to Milaarc we now have possibly the greatest freeze frame of Symphogear conceivable
The sword abuse continues



<:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>


I know this one cursed shot has probably been posted about 6000 times now but
I hope we get more Carol
PHONIC GAIN-DA
Absolutely correct, but that's why i specified confirmation of any kind instead of just kisses.
As much as I love Symphogear for being so different
No doubt it'll be a cute Hibimiku ending, but confirmation is just.. not what these kind of shows do
I would put a kiss far out of expectations so I don't get disappointed

However the next two episodes pan out, it better end with Kirika and Shirabe looking after Elza

Hype exceeding safe levels
Second last episode
Previews tonight
Let‚Äôs be real Hibiki getting a handful of Chris should have been shaky pic.


I am torn
I don't know if I want more Sham-ha Fight or More Epilogue next episode
Is that a XV original or from an earlier season?
Even the scene before it with the Ogawa clan has the most hype BGM
Yeah roger that

I wish Elza was alive <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Shame you don‚Äôt get the next part of Metatonia too, so hype.
<:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241>
So much riding on the last episode, the post episode funk is going to be so rough
<:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
How are you guys coping
Or is it 1900, it‚Äôs one hour some way
Which means it‚Äôs 2100 in JPN
2000 in Aus
Cackling over the out of context Miku bleeding on the floor he‚Äôs uploading
Probably having way too much fun picking the previews
Can someone post Carol‚Äôs ‚ÄúCome back Symphogear!‚Äù So I can save it for the immense amount of use it‚Äôs going to get.
I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm going to make it
I have to dodge this place for most of a whole day after it airs, and I‚Äôm an avid self spoiler.
Didn‚Äôt know how much I needed a recap until I read yours, thanks.
Yeah that‚Äôs what I meant
Sleep time, if I‚Äôm back here before about 20 hours then I F‚Äôd up and spoiled myself.
A good ending + lesbian couple, that‚Äôd be the unicorn ending for Symphogear
<:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Don‚Äôt give me hope
Don‚Äôt do this to me
Kirika?
Wouldn‚Äôt mind that
Maybe we can have college Symphogear in Shinais
Nah I want more of an epilogue than that
But I‚Äôm torn
^ I do agree with that in my heart
<:HibikiHug:620080558462205956>
I‚Äôm just not ready for the next 24 minutes to be the end of Symphogear. I need closure for so much.
Would the MC be the gun girl or the sword girl?
With pretty much pallete swap characters and personalities
Symphogear Sunshine
That‚Äôs pretty baller
quite rare
Futa Miku on Bikibutt is rare
for lore reasons
I need to re-read those fanfics
....
I still use the old chrome app


Here's the only thing I've been doing for the last 18 months
Something Something Commiesubs

Halfway through SB expansion when the big bad pulls this on me
