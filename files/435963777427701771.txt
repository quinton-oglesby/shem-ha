Mumei good civilization


Genjuro would be a gorilla
Chris would be a chihuahua. Smol and full of anger
But also consider: fluffy Hibiki one day replaces normal Hibiki out of the blue. Miku pulls out her research notes, The Helpful Fox Senko-san
Fluffy geahs would get me to learn how to play XDUJP
Since Illya is from fate, does this qualify as NanoFate?

I am inevitable.
And I am... Gungnir *snaps*

Was really hoping for Eiai promise when she began singing
Or: a 2nd generation
There‚Äôs gonna be another 5 announced tomorrow, mark my words
Crossover movie with Nanoha?
Me right now
Really wish Okita or Shuten appeared in Fate/Grand Order‚Äôs Babylonia chapter so she would be in that next season.
She was in Granbelm with season as well
Although the new Carnival Phantasm looks to be funny

Kaleid Liner gets so much better once they get to the actual plot
Illya is bestest girl
Jeanne has also appeared in Extella, Extella Link, and like 3 seconds in Zero
And she shoots beams ~~of her blood~~
Summer Okita‚Äôs NP is just Summer Biki‚Äôs special, and I find that hilarious.

I blame it on that chapter being almost a year old now and how different that voice is from her normal ones
I forgot
Oh yeah, that‚Äôs right
You are forgiven
Just 2 hours of training montage
Yes, I know what I said
Live action where they come to my hometown for a wedding
They‚Äôll have a ‚Äúceremony of eternal friendship‚Äù
Plz gib movie that sets for a 2nd generation
I hope so
Also Kara no Kyoukai, another Type Moon work is a thing. It‚Äôs pretty good.
Tsukihime remake when?
Carnival is the equivalent to the Symphogear specials
~~This isn‚Äôt an anime girl is the MC~~
Do I need to remind everyone who the actual main character was? ||<:Ver:336656981144109066> ||
Like 10000000000% gay
Hibiki is a descendent of Shaggy, change my mind.
At least, that's my theory
Probably detected some power coming from Airgetlam and just assumed it was because she was a descendant. Then upon closer inspection she realizes it's just because of his arm (during the raid on Kazanari house she makes a remark about something interesting about her arm/her arm being interesting)
Mewsy-twosy
So I binged all of what was available of Misfit of Demon King Academy last night, and I can‚Äôt believe I was sleeping on it for so long
When do I watch the movies?
The whole TSB thing came out of pretty much nowhere and had me like wha-
Yes, yes I am
Finished S1 of Nanoha \o/
Hibiki punches Nanoha's beam. What happens? Do they both become friends or do the friendship activators cancel out?
Oh, you mean Befriending beam of Destruction?
(Nanoha A‚Äôs) Ooh, so Raging Heart and Bardiche ||use the Velka Cartridges? That‚Äôs a twist||
Arf is too heckin cute
||adopted||

And now I‚Äôm done with A‚Äôs. Such a sweet ending. I now have double diabetes.
JOOOOOOOOOOOOO-JO!
