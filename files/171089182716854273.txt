I dont know if its that large (definitely no where near the size of this discord) but it’s very active, especially whenever announcements or new content pops up lol
I believe so? I have a handful of symphogear mutuals
Yea! I ran across the inv link on someones profile while I was checking replies and thought I’d join in
But thank you for the welcomes! I ran across this discord on twt and I’m happy to see so many symphogear fans all in one place <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
I’m so overwhelmed looking at all the possible channels
I’m a big fan of symphogear specific bots. Already a great welcome feature lol
Heyo!
