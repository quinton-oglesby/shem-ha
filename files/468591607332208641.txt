Does a bike turning into a flaming horse count <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ?
Glorious DESS face
burn it in hellfire <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
So much padoru
Their so freaking cute!
<:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697> <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
Nah her arms are bent to her chest with tiny fists. They'd probably get lost in her dress. Kiri is also next to her so cropping would look weird/probably not work.
Yay. To bad we can't use the full version. She has her lil arms up and everything but that would probably look weird in a smaller size. But still yay happy shirabe <:ShiraBean:661077098428891136>
This is the one i found. its from one of the Serena Bday 4koma
<@203444794737950720> their from the 4-koma comics. So yes legal.
we need more shirabe <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there was a bunch of faces i suggested from the 4-komas but i think they got swallowed in the see of general or Gear chat. can't edit myself but can look up again.
So many new amazing emotes <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:Zababies:672238628398956594> <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625> <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376> <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345> <:ShirabeJoy:672105345316814878> <:KirikaJoy:672105345342111785> <:MikuWhoa:670502684692054042> <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080> <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984> <:KirikaCry:671948299179130885> <:KanadeSmile:672455286392356884> <:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882> <:KanadeBleh:672455306059579392> <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845> <:FujitakaScared:672430483702939659> <:FineShocked:672430513025187840> <:ElfneinPalm:672430572961923092> <:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984>
Hmm we have Fujitaka but no Tomosato yet. Maybe something with her <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
now to see if we can find some good Kanade emotes <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well you told me to drop the whole thing. or did you mean the whole 4-koma. i can do that <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and one more Shirabe face. ShirabeConcern? ShiraEh? and that's it for now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

yeah crops a bit much on the head
possible Jiiemote. Sorta like a ShirabeKanpai. there is a Bikki next to her doing it too but not sure it would work cause the dang speechbubble takes a good part of her head but I'll put it up just in case too
a bunch of the emotes are edited and have their BG removed so yes it's been done before <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't know. can't edit it myself hence why i put it here if anyone wants to try cleaning it
and since I'm a cruel monster, this is the cryingKiri before it
BEHOLD! ShiraHug! or would it be ShiraComfort? Either way Shirabe comforting a crying Kiri cause she loves her Kiri-chan. Yes its from the 4-komas.
I'll see if i find more good Shirafaces later <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh snap they got added <:MariaWhat:671948299405885440> <:KirikaCry:671948299179130885>
and this one is still a fav
this Maria face <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
smaller
bikkigohan perhaps?
Fair
Oof now they both look good
Yeah but then u could use the 1st image for being bored in general or other things
Oh right maybe we could find some nice Serena in XDU cards. I forgot <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
(ChrisPraying every time someone prays to the RNGGods <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )
I'd say the 1st chris leaning on her hand, Chrisw/mic, ChrisPraying, GearChris with the bleh face aand GearChris with the shocked/fear face
Dang 19 new + the return if the 12 missing padorus.
Hnn can't seem to find anything good per say for Serena (fairly same face most of the time or hidden behind people or speech bubbles right on top of her) and the only thing i can think of is maybe a SerenaZesshou so we can have more jam
fair. trying to see if i can find a decent basa face
cute lil basa writting on a notepad
possible maria

ElsaSick perhaps
maybe more cropping
or  bit more close up
hmm not sure if this vanessae or
more millaarc
yes
behold! "V" Germain. could maybe be cropped better. idk
Im surprised Carol's "5 seconds before slaughter" hasn't been added as an emote or a command <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
a possible better KiriWink but then
TriplePeek <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
get chants for every gear <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
a crying gear for every fan <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
have a possible chris
yeah shirabe has same face syndrome. its hard finding new emotes for her
or how about this
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
aaaw no more kiri? not even for this?

kinda hard finding DMJii emotes in the 4-koma. im running low <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
fair
im a horrible monster. behold ShiraCry
BasaCry
another possible basa but needs some cleaning and maybe a bit of cropping
a bit more close-up
here's a possible one. maybe for writing prompts or writing ideas. don't know. not sure this one or
I meant how much space we have left <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>  we need more emotes <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
So what's the emote total so far <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ?
Someone performed sorcery while no one was looking cause new emotes

Nonesense. Elsa says symphogear will take over the west <:Germain:421434126856486912>

realizing we dont have anything representing the true MVP. Bike-kun. tho i guess trying to find something good could be a hassle

hmmm elf9 working hard? could probably be cropped better tho

2nd one depends how you wanna crop it

2 good maria faces
don't worry we have a fairly MariaPikaFace <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
And of course the Fan TL too <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
It's this one. You can just look them up in the official site and DL all of them like i did <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
maybe a little bigger?
ShiraRead or
she's so adorable with her lil fist
great. now i can't unsee that <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

SerenaBulli2 or SerenaSick

Also just noticed we had a Fine role <:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
Inb4 removing SG/Cag/Prelati roles and make it into "color me Bavarian Illuminati". So it matches with "color me Noble Red" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Maybe prelati should be a darker green cause of the frog
https://symphogear.bushimo.jp/special
its the official site <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

hmmm think the bikki one can be cropped a bit more

the basa bday 4-koma was put up in the official site. u know what that means
SobabaJii/SobabaDess or ZabasobJii/ZabasobDess or instead of Jii/Dess its S/K

4 emote slots are also taken by split DMJii emotes

Ooh maybe either disintegrating or exploding <:Bike:690470896892379136> too <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I suggest 2 song stone animation emotes. One that sparkles and one that disintegrates <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Emotes are a dangerous business <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Plus the 1-2 cute 4koma bayonet hugs are used in another server iirc <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We need another crazy laugh face that isnt Ver and problem solved <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

<:ElfneinTrip:688025973932687377> <:ElsaSeeU:672845806415511553> for chopping block?
Oh wow that was <:FineShocked:672430513025187840>

To be fair kiri has amazing expressions
Maybe <:KirikaHappy:688432863796133888> . We have <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384> <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830> <:KirikaBean:731532693170290709>

TwinHeart, ReadyGo, Let's dance, Pose

there was a micha emote suggested some time back
regarding the party bikki
maybe it could be cropped a bit more

this is also edgebikki btw <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>


oh nevermind then
think it was replaced with <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
too small i think

as for the arm probably just crop it closer
fair
yes assuming if anyone wants to
found this cuteBikkiwave too

Hmm guess so
What about <:ElfneinBullying:421432763078410241> ?
Oooh nice. Didnt notice that one
Ooh new emotes <:HibikiKiss:738240567049191505><:MikuKiss:738240587014340649> also hmmm was <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912> updated?
We are/were going to loose boosts so server was going to derank in a few days or something
So does that mean we're safe now <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938> ?
found this elf9 but i wouldn't even know what it would be anyways. full image is her tapping away on the computer
that or one thing is just a picture of a glass of chocolate milk or soda that you were just drinking and another thing making a fancy new dish that you decided to try out or symphogear shaped cookies <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

We still need dusting gem and/or exploding gem <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:GarieLaugh:740956278163243050>
To be fair there was talk of an NR role with a "rusty red color" but nothing happened iirc
Or the person linking it mentions "hey this is an album. Some character and character stuff here too" etc <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh cool new Bot <:HibikiWow:738172615453048912> as long as it doesnt try to take over the world <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. If its incharge of sourcing images in SFW/NSFW then might i suggest putting the "how to skip art links" in the pins in SFW/NSFW? I think we did that before for the old bots
The cape is so amazing it gets its own role
could make the serena one an animated emote tho <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

And their short so they wouldnt take long to DL
Other option for Genocide command is the scene with all the chibi carols from one of the XV OVA
"Soy la Asesina de Milagros (I am the Murderer of Miracles)" <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Spaniard Carol <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Make the Gen yeeting Bikki a bot command <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
I like <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>  but <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>  is also the one from the yuri flower scene <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
regarding the channel suggestion thing. anime-club is for discussing anime/manga without spoilers (whether current or not for the new people who are watching). nongear-spoilers discusses all media with spoilers. manga still seems to be delegated to nongear-spoiler though and both channels are almost interchangeable if it weren't for the media limit. we have gaming and mobile-gaming so maybe add 2 more channels that follow the same rules as anime-club. 1 for tv-media (this would be live-action, movies, tokusatsu, cartoons, etc. shows) and maybe add one for books (novels, light novels, etc. that isn't manga) as a test run or something.
nongear-spoilers
anime-club (anime/manga discussion)
tv-media-club (or some other name if you like)
book-club
though hmmm where would visual novels fall in <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>...
poor serena doesn't get pets
easy. just make this panel a command. 9Punch or something. or any BikkiPunchingSomethingHard scene from the show really <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
another angrybikki
could probably be cropped some more too
oh and we have this Kanadescared face. the problem is the shadow on the top right. Maybe it could be edited out. Sweatdrops could either stay or be removed too
V2
oh and angrybikki
we have ElsaCharge and Germain(Charge). Now i present BikkiCharge <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
and then people can stop asking for goddamn fishGears <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
make fish of all the Gears and THEN turn it into a gif. like the paduro one
oh hey guess i found the perfect crop spot <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

this one i mean
shame cant properly use the AngryAlterBikkiFace cause of the speech bubbles and stuff
you want a clear image of all that suffering <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
could be a bit more if necessary but it depends though
HibikiSickV3
just the face probably. cause the more details the lesser you can see when the image is shrunk/tiny
yeah i think HibikiSick would be the winner here
a little more centered
HibikiSickV2
HibikiSickV1



so many new great faces from the 4-komas AlterBikkiPonder or BikkiThink
the pixel emotes could be combined to make an animated emote maybe. at least for tomosato/fujitaka <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
<:SongStone:688213224012644370>
along with bike <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
oh right we still have <:SongStone:688213224012644370> too. wasnt there a plan to make it animated <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:HibikiMunch:672606446239744000> <:HibikiMonch:688190074646691843> <:ShirabePout:336656831978012712> maybe one of these? the only other option is one of the double emote sets
when we have so many great emojis that one cant decide what to get rid of anymore <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
We lost 2 boosts <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
I'd petition to make emotes of the fire background chris and miku "its fine" from the recent radio. Whether animated or not. but not on pc to screenshot/link <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

We could move the pixel emotes to the other server and re-add the kanade pixel there too <:TomosatoPixel:691727930371342447> <:FujitakaPixel:691727929922813984> also bike unless somebody can make the exploding bike emote <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
YumiCheer <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
To be fair we dont have a crying/teary eyed chris. The new 4-komas give so much good stuff <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
A very top class Basa face <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
in the comic
you forgot smuglolimaria <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
like i said. some good emote possibilities from the new 4-komas <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
well the rules in fancontent pins already says that nsfw/smut fics can be posted there but must be tagged as NSFW. images are the ones that has to posted in the proper channel (nsfw channel)
i doubt we make much nsfw to have a separate channel for it though the other option would be permitting nsfw in fancontent but could apply a rule that it must be tagged as nsfw and spoilered (if its an image) <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432> <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
or both <:KirikaSkeptical:586406806482583556> <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
either replace <:Zababies:672238628398956594>  with the new hug or put it in the emote server

oh but we do have a kiriactually. i forgot whoops <:KirikaActually:688433197402554423>
oh god editing that 2nd image so it has the glassglare thing
not our fault the new 4-koma is a goldmine of kiri emotes
or KiriSmart. KiriGenius
MEGANE2 or KiriActually
MEGANE1
top left looks like a KiriActually just flexing her smarts
MEGANE
megane is megane and lily. dont forget the lilies
move all the double emotes to the emote server and then we have space <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
now the question is if we used the cropped image should it keep the BG or erase it or replace it with something else

birthday bot command <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>  should it be the full image or an edit with Kiri and the birthday cake
unless it was turned into a bot reaction image maybe?
sadness <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
true
we can't forget this glory

mmm all the XDU Fine art available is either kinda generic or not good/usable so nah
the one before she ||turns around and throws the nehushtan chain to pull the moon fragment down||
someone could always make an animated emote of her crazy smile face from S1EP13
KiriCulture
i wonder if it could be cropped more
you can move the pixel emotes to the other server too <:FujitakaPixel:691727929922813984> <:TomosatoPixel:691727930371342447>
4-koma gave plenty of good material for the scorers <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
and a bigger version of this one too

❗
oh and hey we got this too
cause coins and sparkles!
oh and this is the full version of the Flashy Leiur in case a better cut/edit could be made

well we have this one but giant "!"
aand that's all of them i think <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>












new 4-koma and all about Carol and Autoscorer so lots of possible emotes
behold this Maria
No no. The basa in the BG got removed <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
behold this Serena

our lady tomosato <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

oh shit we forgot another top tier
the miku one is top tier. you can crop the enki some more considering a full body shot isnt very visible in the smaller size
our poor boy Enki suffering
now with more fist
we have been blessed with new emote potentials. blame millhi <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
probably better without the steam? i mean its not really that noticeable when tiny sized so i guess its ok if its edited out
lovely <:KirikaGlee:698939825927094384>
or yeah have the full one as a command <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i think the 2nd one without the long braid is better when tiny sized
better quality for <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>

also leaving poor androidkiri out of the augear team you heretics
the cooking miku seems highly appropriate considering the cooking doujin. chris bang because yes chris bang, fighting spirit bikki because yes gotta get pumped. nothing like invoking the wrath of shem-ha and some good ol SGBikki "Even so!"




hmmm going through the list yet again and dropping more sticker suggestions because yes 👀
<:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
perhaps these yes 👀


so if im reading right the max sticker amount is 15/30/60 (by boost lvl) sooooo 👀
gear pendant, the philosophers stone (the heart)
oh how about the gear pendant
accesories.. hmm well some can be easy enough Chris could be the face of the bunny keychain, Basa her hair pin, Ryoko/Fine her butterfly, Bikki has 2 hair pin types if you want regular or AU. Miku her ribbon
uuh i think by faction badges they meant the ones for SONG and Illuminati i think?
faction badges are also a good option too and yeah agree they should be a separate command if they get added in (and if its possible)
the aufwachens, the mechvaranus (in 3 colors), all the alchemist symbols (the respective element ones color coded to represent an autoscorer), shem-ha's symbol
the main9 aufwachens maybe? mm they'd probably look pretty bad super small
besides what icons could we use. those things look kinda very small <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
basa can also finally kill us with her wink
also possible sticker

Special Eps 12
possible sticker
possible sticker
possible sticker?
dont mind me just going through the 4-komas again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Dark purple or something? Maybe something related to his true form i guess
Gold too yeah
Whatever his skin color is cause nude <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and then spoilers channel discusses all spoilers no matter the media i guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
on the one hand a general book channel would be neat but i also agree the anime-club channel already covers anime/manga/LNs (and cartoons cause "anime" meant "all animated cartoons" anyways) and most people read LNs then it might be moot. the other option is any non-anime related book content could go to Live-Action-Media (ex. Lord of the Rings or something idk). if a material has an anime/manga/LN counterpart then the material can have some liberty and be discussed in either channel within reason (ex. star wars has some manga/anime. yeah you can discuss/mention the LA star wars movies but stick to the anime/manga in the anime/manga channel and more extensive movie talk would go to L.A.M)
Lmao DAMN <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872> <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872> <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
If you have max boost its 250 max for basic emotes and another 250 for animated emotes. Yes their separate so its convenient. Basic emptrs are full but obviously we have lots of space for animated ones
you can still use them if you still remember the command names for them
welp looks like discord is acting up again. some of the stickers aren't popping up in desktop menu though their still visible in mobile
i just realized that no one has suggested making the kiricar into a sticker. just a clear screenshot of it. no edit. unless the quality would be too bad?
Hello.
Gotta sell that merch <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

Aah i see someone else also thought of BattraKiri <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
I mean when you think about it all the Gears should be Mothra. She is summoned/awakened/powered by song. Wait... how many "mothra" we got..  there's OG design... then her "son" in movie trilogy has like 5 looks (3 basic forms and 2 power up modes) and KOTM mothra. 7 designs?... NANA WILLS IT! Bonus Battra for Carol maybe.
Super late but goddamn that Kanazilla earlier is fucking beast omg <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Oh trust us. Depending on how long the Global version takes to catch up, you probably wont even get to meet her in like 2 years <:Ver:336656981144109066>

oh and the movies. never forget the movies <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
unless your talking about the tv spot? i remember them doing baton passes for some of the Cures to promote the next one
i only know of the one cameo that shows up in hugtto. so if there are more then <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
the only exceptions being MaxHeart is the sequel to OG PreCure and 5 GoGo is the sequel to Precure5. There is also the one episode from... I think it was Hugtto with a special crossover event. Everything else is standalone.

did someone say Allenby?
Because he's Tony Glazer of course <:TonyEyeRoll:580561912513691679>
Yes
its 2 seasons but its promoted as a multimedia franchise so you have at least 1-3 novels that act as prequels and side stories and while not exactly obligatory some stuff only gets explained in detail in said novels and hinted in the anime. well 2 novels since 1 at least gets animated as the first half of S2. luckily they have already been fan translated.

Style does look familiar though
Shirabe only links stuff from pixiv. Might be twitter or something
https://twitter.com/mokutan_mmmm/status/1215696711877681154
new chris design from an upcoming XDU event. Also includes a short hair Basa. Very likely a new AU. All the freaking out yes.

Maybe i should post the GearPadorus on pixiv eventually <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That Visqi MariaBikki for the MariaMural looks pretty and pose is nice but their lower half (especially maria because main focus) looks weird. Her legs are too far down. Poor Serena. So very little about her that she won't get a Mural <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
draw knees like you're drawing an angry bird face. Alrighty then <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
Ah yes that one proto sailor moon design. Back when she was suppose to have a gun. Good times <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Thats what i mean
Im glad we finally see the S1 book but kinda sad nearly all of it is black/white when we know most of the images are in color. Includes the blonde Kanade image but its in black/white <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
And of course there are books for every season <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No. From the Symphogear S1 Official Artbook
But that Basa pic is obviously Visqi so u might as well get it from the source and all his other good stuff than the evils of 4chan <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
When it was originally 2 funny pics with no relation and then someone posted them together because "hey look at these 2 funny pictures" but due to the way the page layout works it sets them side by side and the meme was born <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
There is one for each season and they all should be scanned iirc
flashy and fabulous <:LeiurFlashy:674522617989955595>
Im sure a lot of people would sell their souls for them hoodies <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Perfect DuoChris but dang weird boob physics ruins it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Pardon for going a bit back but DAAAAMN that uncolored X-Drive Miku figure is insane <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
This one is orobably SG
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Count_of_St._Germain
Yeah probably that one
SG.. there is one that mentions sonethibg about a high noble out of nowhere and supposedly associated with alchemy
Cagliostro is probably the one associated with some royal necklace shenanigans and whatnot. They specifically keep mentioning Cag being a former "conman"
Dat earlier Shem-ha Noriko is top tier. Pun intended <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
see more Visqi OOOOOOOOOOH <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>





Basa paired with Rokusho. Good culture <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
regarding the sleeping dmjii/chris chibi. you could just check in JP_XDU and get them there <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:KanadeBlush:672455329451343882>
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
<:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
but seriously just give us the god damn Bride Units for everyone. story doesnt even matter at this point if their making EV without stories now and just dropping Units whenever they feel like it. they were so pretty/cute <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and it actually was a while until we got another EV with story
it was after the bride debacle that we started getting EV with no story
wonderland i think. since that was after bride EV iirc
i think even kaneko, during a recent interview cause of the new/recent Mechvaranus JP event, politely call out the writing team for not doing more with the XDU stories <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
colors are nice but them broken backs ouch <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>
Its not fanart. Its one of her old XDU birthday card arts <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://twitter.com/futagokamikita/status/1234635889600385024
Could rip you apart <:ShirabeFear:696380146248319066>  and yet has such an adorable face <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306>
in a Super Robot mood i guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Now remember people we must erase FORCE from existence. Wasn't it cancelled or something so its no longer canon <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ?
Well worse case she ||might have had to nuke the place and no Reinforce meant no perfect control of any damages|| so yeah good times <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Ah yes when Nanoha was teaching her lesson "gently" and "kindly" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And dont forget she also did the cleaning, sewing and shopping while also doing her doc visits and teaching her lil rag tag family until they got the hang of it. Hayate best wife/mom <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
She lived alone and learned to be a responsible self-sufficient person so not surprising. Also she always wanted to cook for a big group anyways <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Hibiki would be top student of Nanoha's class. The one time she wouldn't be nearly flunking class or something. She already has the perfect wife <:HibikiDab:688190074395164696>

AXZ no. 3.5, 4.5 and XV are exceptions because promoting. 3.5 was later added to the MainQuest proper and 4.5 and XV will too eventually at some point. AXZ was added directly to MainQuest.
Nope. Its the story from the XDU-Quest
Good times <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Girl is so apeshit she might make Fine look like a saint... which is kinda funny cause she is another AUFine... who got her soul devoured by the evils of the multiverse instead <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ...
More like they kill her but implied she could come back/revive herself/pull a Fine. Its not sure yet though
And they all promised to "play with her again" if she ever came back. Meaning kick her ass some more <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Everyone has to get a chance to slap the crazy lady after all <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
She's been busy between being the ultimate shield, keeping bikki sane when she almost got overtaken by an evil relic (giving kanade and maria the chance to save her) and helping destroy the villains world destroying monster and she does get her hits in during the final fight (tag teaming with bikki iirc)
Sadly no but she is part of the 9gear team kicking her ass
She has "interest" in the "you are so nice and trusting and full of hope that i want to break you" kind
Yes a very bad one <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>

When you can identify the art style as 2 being old school 80s Transformers, 1 is based on TF:Animated Prowl, 1 is based on TF:Prime Arcee and 1 is based on a specific toymold from the Combiner Wars toyline (tho it could be 80s or something else perhaps) <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>

yeeeaaah i think it depends on the cure series. im still going through the early ones but i think i remember something about 1-2 of the shows toning it down or something? which is a pretty dumb and stupid decision if they did <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> Healin' Good so far has plenty of CQC

Careful some/mostly nsfw in that link



https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/81638103

https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/82349710

Oh hey Shirabe did give the link after all. So maybe it was lag
Uploading from phone/discord app can choose/upload in batches. depends on the server limit tho so i go for 4-6. Doing so Shirabe would only give the link of the last image so made sure their all from the same source/link for consistency
Here's the link
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/75022886
Huh. Jii broke perhaps







At the very least theKanade/Basa in black outfits is Official Art. So if you can find the Symphogear Visual Collection Artbook it is good profit <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/52595186
Anything with Ver is cursed unless when he's getting properly beaten to a pulp <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Since Shirabot didnt post the link. Uuh careful with some images <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/82535135

More like something something bikki dreaming/meeting(?) a bikki who went to the concert with miku but bikki was the only one who survived and still got gungnir. More sad things after but i guess our bikki comforted(?) her in the end. <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

context is ||AndroidKiri sacrificing herself to save AUKiri. AUKiri is in a coma in a stasis tube healing. They get a relic to heal her faster but the bad guys cut the power and she would die because of it. AndroidKiri sacrifices herself to power the machines to save AUKiri. AUShirabe, who finally accepted AndroidKiri, didn't want that. AndroidKiri shocks/electrocutes AUShirabe so she wouldn't get in the way and left her with 3 clear instructions. Eat properly, clean her room and smile. She has to smile to greet AUKiri when she wakes up after all. AndroidKiri smiles to the end.|| <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961> <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961> <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961> <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>

f*ck this old fan-art ended up prediction the future hitting a little to close to home considering what happened in LOST SONG <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>

oh right. i was too distracted by the long hair <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
(cause stasis tubbed for so long)
AUKirika is Kiri but with long hair
getting rebuilt and becoming/doing a combo technique with AUShirabe/AUkirika would be glorious 👀
not the same. and she was built from super advance secret parallel technology
buut more likely we could get proper AUKiri fighting next time.
even if they rebuild AndroidKiri she might not be the same one since they said she literally fried everything to save AUKiri. so it could be AndroidKiri2.0. on the other hand they could handwave it saying some of her did survive after all or AUShirabe recreates the magic of copy/paste alchemy to reconstruct her memories. also we dont know if the relic they used to save AUKiri was destroyed and if in theory they could use it on AndroidKiri 👀

Speaking of which i should finish Smile one of these days <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
First couple of episodes were a bit painful cause of Hibiki and Kanade conflict but the payoff was worth it
I liked Suite PreCure. Thought it was pretty well done. Reminded me of OG/MaxHeart but shorter, better paced and more characters
https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/85068256

lol true. AUBasa started it. she said her AUChris was cuter. then Basa was just "now wait just a minute". Bikki not helping the situation. it went from "the cute way she calls me senpai, the messy way she eats and how she tries to be all important to her lil kouhais" vs "the cute/shy way she clings to my shirt. i've died from that level of moe"
and the poor Chrises are just <:ChrisEmbarrassed:738167509869527060> <:ChrisEnraged:423196924368388105>
yes they do and did if only for a bit. where do you think Chris and AUChris being embarrassed because Basa and AUBasa were "arguing" about who has the cuter Chris <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Well they havent updated it since January though. Gonna have to wait and see if they post another big picture batch

So let's just add to it
Someone was in a medaspree 👀

Also taking place after XV.  Maria starts with her FaustGear look in the fight then switches to pre-AXZ look. Early Silhouette technique heck yeah <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
Something something Maria was helping Basa clean the kazanari house. Reminiscing about the whole Fudo/Yatsu shitfest that happened in XV. She finds an old pocketwatch thing while cleaning. She gets to keep it. Timeskips she heads to SONG HQ. Gjallahorn reacts and at tge same time the watch also glows. FISTrio end up in Demonslayer. Blahblah fight a demon its strong. YoungFudo shows up and kicks its ass with some very familiar Tsubasa-like moves. Ends with Maria asking who he is and him probably introducing himself
FISTrio end up in Demonslayer world and meet a young demon hunter Fudo is the point <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yoooooh 👀

Oh and she mostly wears yellow. He'd say its best color
Tho i dont know i think medabee would get along better with Bikki than Iggy out of spite, she's such a happy hamster and compliment him for being amazing and cool,  she's a cute girl and fairly gullible so he could make a lil white lie/prank and she'd believe it but he'd apologize after getting his laughs <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yoooh that is good stuff. Medabot×Gear collab when 👀 👀



https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/86812819


Ok so if im reading the tags right that micha pic is referencing Gundam Barbatos Lupus Rex from GundamIBO <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Also TinyGunbuster is cute. Must squishy hug it <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>  and i dont knie hiw to feel about MazinEmperorG being a maid. Cute though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Everything is better when its Getter <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Xenosaga medabots 👀







And Shin CutieHoney is soorta a "sequel" to the 80's OGCutieHoney
Then everything i said still applies <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Oh and bonding about lost loved ones with more than half of them too <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Honey would definitely make flirty advances on Maria and Chris just to make them blush like crazy. Sword fighting with Basa. Being silly with Bikki. Trading disguise tricks/tips with DMJii. Bonding about revenge with Kanade. Talking about that "special someone" with Miku. She'd love all the girls. And if its Honey with the ||Android/Robot|| backstory then they'd bond over talking about Miina and AndroidKiri and treat her like a person. Still freak out when she gets naked though. Insert Bikki's spooked face from XV when Vanessa was opening her jacket <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>




https://www.pixiv.net/en/artworks/1739821

Oh and Rose of Versailles too
Strong iconic females perhaps? I mean i see Nausicaa and Princess Mononoke and Ghost in the Shell too
<:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>

This place needs more Honey <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> although forgot how hard it was finding not-lewd stuff <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>



oh shit both of us just realized DesKaiser face is fairly MazinZero like and now we <:AdamScream:688241618356404224>
showed my brother the Kaiser one. google TL says its name is DesKaizer. could be a prototype unused Mazinkaiser SKL design maybe
<@!279341087494242304>
yoooh that looks beast. didn't know about this 👀 as for the earlier Great Mazinger one i never saw it either but i think i do recall my brother telling me some suppose rumors/stuff about Shin Great way back when. since Shin Mazinger ||was one of Zeus fists|| then Great would've been the other or something like that iirc and considering the position of those fingers it definitely looks that way 👀

Symphogear x Uma Musume. Full circle i see <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>





they retconned Macross 2 at least. but yeah its possibly just a rumor. no way mom and the girls would've kept their mouths shut or get along with him if it was true. they'd take turns beating his ass probably <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
i didn't know there was a side-story Macross 7 manga. looking info up a bit. If the creators themselves haven't confirmed him as his son in all this time and had ||Jenius himself saying he isn't|| then either its not true, it was but got retconned or it could be a callout to the same way Macross 7 had the rumor/theory in-show that ||Basara was Hikaru's son from Macross-1 but isn't|| (because it was being published at the same time Macross 7 aired). And Macross 7 never hinted at ||Jenius/Milia's relationship falling out because of some "extra marital thing" but simply that they couldn't see eye to eye anymore iirc||.

Lol people already drawing the Winter Clothes. Choose your fav


though Hibiki and Maria do show up in the EV their victims caught in the crossfire an dbeing controlled by the villain (Chloe does refer to Hibiki as a "Berserker") and the Prisma gang leave as soon as their rescued so there isn't much interaction between them. The EV was also summary TLed in Twitter too. It's literally more Kirika/Illya, Shirabe/Miyu, Chris/Chloe. I'm just guessing people want to draw Maria in it for the heck of it because why not <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it was one of the outfits for the Winter Clothes contest and because Shirabe does look quite like Fine with her hair down it only makes sense. i guess now we know what she could've dressed like if Fine did posses her <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Pretty much FISTrio visit mom and Serena in Serenaverse. Dracula is woken up and cursed Maria, Shirabe and Serena to turn them into his loyal monster. Kirika's Phonic Gain wakes up Kresnik, the spirit of the man who beat dracula and who is bound in the silver bullet relic that kept Dracula sealed (when the thing was pulled out Dracula was free to wake up). Kirika has to kill Dracula or the FISGirls cant be saved. She gets help from ChrisBikki. Originally Krsnik granted/transferred them knowledge/skills but Kirika merges the Silver Bullet directly into Igalima, gets her duorelic and kills Dracula saving the day. The story is translated/posted on YT so you can look it up <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yeah pretty much is the Gears combining a relic with their respective symphogear to make a DuoRelic Mode
Hibiki - Gungnir-Mjolnir
Basa - AnH-Murakumo (aka Kusanagi. Same/similar sword Fudo used)
Chris - Ichiaval-Nehushtan Staff (do not confuse with the Nehushtan Armor from S1 though their similar)
Maria - Airgetlam-Hermes Sword
Shirabe -Shulshagana-Yasakani no Magatama
Kirika - Igalima- Silver Bullet (used to kill/seal dracula)
Kanade - Gungnir-Brinsingamen
Miku - Aegis Shield
Serena - Airgetlam-Gleipnir
Obviously XDU taking some liberties with some/most of the relic myths. Most relics are from Alternate Worlds they visit

didnt the summary mention something about taking out the remains of the Illuminaty or something
watch this being the AXZ version of G. 3 runaways being hunted by Basa's grandfather probably so he can get their tech, kill them and then go steal God's throne cause why not
i think G plot in general followed S1 fine, besides its obvious writting problems. it did follow up in several things including the moon problem and the fact that Fine did work with another government and  finished the Fine story
yeah their probably just a smokescreen
on that note, let the "Holy One" be Fine and God's son just for plottwist
forgot to add "not so secret y person is in fact the real villain who carries out world domination plan"
hence why i said 3 runaways being hunted by x person
nah the real antagonists in G, besides Ver who was an idiot that only got so far because plot was written that way, was the US government
oh and these 3 girls pull an alchtrio
the worse case scenario is that, after Basa's grandfather was such a horrible piece of sh**, he gets redemption or some form of it.
Well they r the only ones who licensed and subbed it. Funi had it before and they treated it worse and your only other options for a legal stream if someine else picked it up would b Viz, Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon. Not any good choices. Forgot Sentai/Hidive
*crosses fingers for AXZ and XV*
elfneing being the special case since her knowledge came from Carol and who knows what crazy tech/alchemy she knew before frying her memories really
but if they could make it they could surely fix gears and they cant do that so probably not
id imagine at least Ver MAYBE could but no one else. because Ryoko/Fine doesnt like sharing to much of her little secret techs cause they belong to her so screw everyone else
i don't know if your talking about the 3 new villains or the FIS trio.
you have weird plots in the series. might as well go nuts
also the reason the tower was destroyed and humanity was cursed wasn't because god did it. the custodians blew it up and caused all that chaos while he/she was in the bathroom or on break
plottwist God was totally ok with Fine loving him/her maybe even reciprocated? The custodians killed  and or dethroned god and took his/her throne. Fine found out and all this time it was to avenge him/her
or something
watch Genjuro punch god for not being man enough to tell a woman no in the face instead of condemning all of humanity
im sure he is human. if they do give reason for his super strength then it's probably more likely they'd go for the "he is tapping into lost human strength buried in our DNA" or some such. plain good old fashion willpower.
1st episode is out yes
watch as this whole mess is cause the wife got jelly that Enki paid attention to Fine and wanted to kill them all
so a little research there might be at least minimum 7 annunaki tho there are less or more depending on the myths and many go unnamed. Enki being responsible for the creation of humanity. also says he was married.
^
yes
Germain gave them their research back in AXZ. also them absorbing alchemy energy in exchange for the ignite system
apparently his name pops up in the credits
nah we'll get flashbacks of her with the mysterious custodian with lovey dovey eyes.
just pin it on this channel and we all good
id expect maybe more duets at least. there are still some combos missing after all
probably not since Ignite is gone
Maria copying everything. Even a faceplant
Watch enki b alive and maybe go revenge crazy when he finds out Fine is dead. Then bikki says the "believe in the song in ur heart" that she told her and enki flashbacks to remembering he or she said the exact same thing to each other before and then feels
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Release the mummy!
Its not just bayformers. Thats a standard tf legend and as usuak bayformers screws it up
The coffin is the annunaki that started the "war" and enki died trying to stop it. Seems legit
Well if it uses a bit of the legend then enki not only made humanity but also sided with them while the other annunanki saw humanity as lowly trash.
A side-effect to keep the custodians away from earth
Or the curse might b more than just simply sealing the universal language
And if enki="god" then looks like he might hav reciprocated her feelings or something too
Or something
Airgetlam interests me too. I recall someone going a bit into the legend thats says Nuada was buried with all his treasures including his silver arm
Or enki has a very interesting stabby wound in his chest too.
Im pretty sure she is using gungnir and at some point in time gungnir couldve gotten lost or stolen or to much time passed and people forgot its name but point is it did a little travelling and stabbed jesus. The end
All this is one big custody battle full of betrayals and assasinations
Watch enki adopt the FIS trio. "Their descendents of Fine. They my daughters or greatgreatgreatgreatggggggrandaughters now."
Shows up in credits apparently
He's around giving a hand
your a custodian and he's a custodian. everyone is a custodian!
Because alchemy reasons
Bikki broke her leg armor during the transformation because heels. Let chris armor purge while saying bang
Adam is annoying. Ver is a piece of shit.
someone mentioned it before
Rokka Ryouran or something
they start making OVAs/Movies based on the XDU plotlines in an alter setting. eventually, with all the autraveling the XDUGears eventually end up in the animeAU meeting the AnimeGears
well fragments lack power on their own. if it was a complete relic it would regenerate itself and function on its own but fragments can't. the wielder is sorta also their brand new battery.
and the relic/gear system apparently is very nitpicky and fairly alive since Gungnir did refuse to work for Bikki in GX for being an idiot
relic fragments are picky little things and they just like certain songs
the songs the wielders sing resonates with the fragments specific wavelength/auwchform or whatever. so its own song in a sense
the gear system was invented by Ryoko, not Fine. when her theory was confirmed, when ame-no-habakiri reacted to basa, she got possesed by Fine and then she went and made her 2nd puppet organization FIS and she did do work on her own.
elf9 could probably learn to do so or already does but like melua said. alca-noise screw everything up if you don't have some anti-alca-noise and that was dainsleif and thats gone
oh that too
people not using gear tech was explained. since the relics have a specific song it be too much of a pain in the ass to find wielders
Black Gungnir is a fragment of kanade's gungnir that Fine stole during her time in SD2 while studying it
Maria never gets a role. it probably focuses more on airgetlam and not her. heck that big thing about "airgetlam" not being its name is already a big plot point
heck maybe Enki was killed with it
or at least one of them
watch as that move is brought back to kill the custodians
like he did in XDU
just give him the magic gauntlet and let him fix everything
Gen is strong because trope. maybe its just referencing his VA's other roles
best bet would'v been kanade falling into a coma because of the zesshou for 2 years and basa feeling guilty about it
should probably take this conversation to gear-discussion
bikki couldnt say the activation song in GX. she started coughing
when they resonate they can say it. but if they cant they cant repeat the words
no one can actually say the activation songs
its just good old fashion anime logic about heart/soul/spirit.
nah it'll be Fudo after he learns his lesson. then Yatsuhiro becomes head of family , Gen prbably becomes a politician [hah] and Basa is either finally free to continue singing or becomes head of SONG
Serena has fans cause people wanted her to be treated better.. and get an actual dang song that wasn't Apple
so in the most ironic sense i guess Fine was the most honest about her intentions?
oh and i guess Germain is sorta similar to Fine but without ruling over humanity [probably] but being all into all sacrifice is worth it... except she's a hypocrite cause totally into sacrifice everyone except Cag and Prelati.
and Ver was just psycho
Fine yes wanted to kill the gods for revenge and and rule over humanity cause she doesn't trust humans
Adam just wanted to kill the Gods and kill humanity cause he hates everyone. remember he jelly cause the Gods got bored and abandoned him for an imperfect race.
HE'S A CUSTODIAN!
plottwist the plan WAS to imbue god powers into the hat
funny i think in the gridman event in XDU they sorta did? i know Chris and Maria got super self-conscious when they got turned giant because while Bikki and Basa got full body suits from the new Gridforms, Chris and Maria do not have pants and people could probably look up
^
and be amazed
have fun
easy to find on YT
it was an extra in the blurrays for G
at least she could've gotten a song as an extra in the CDs or something. even Miku had a song back in S1 and a fancy transformation sequence in S2 in the extras
Also Carol did have a limit. She was suffering body rejection and was dying. All that memory burning and body swapping had screwed her up so after her last bodyswap from suicide she wouldn't be able to do it again.
He learned his lesson after loosing his shoes in S1
He was prepared for the situation. He wore extrawarm underpants. He's always prepared.
Because he is simply Gen and just crazy anime strong. If anything if he couldn't win then at least its possible he wanted to go just to help the girls regroup a bit or get them out.
He gets pretty restless too. He wants to go fight too but nobody lets him cause he's the commander.
Being an overprotective dad. Things were looking pretty bad and wanted to go help.
Before getting severly injured because super reckless but had to make sure that punch hit no matter what. Then the Gears take it from there
And then watch Gen give one solid good punch to the guy on behalf of Fine and Enki/God(?).
No one besides the alchemy trio and probably fudo will die just to fill the death quota. Oh and a custodian too. Heck maybe that death scene in the opening is the quota. If it turns out that he is the "god" that Fine fell in love with then he probably did reciprocate her feelings and died trying to stop something to save her and she never knew and all that time she spent hating him for his "betrayal" was a waste.
The last episode will b evangelion tv levels of no budget. Just a bunch of random dialogue and still images that will enrage the fanbase so much the staff decides to make a movie that is so depressing and bad end that will drive the fans nuts
they are the remains of the illuminati and yeah seems they have other plans whatever they may be.
and as for kiri, well dess
what are those first few seconds of the episode you ask? you just watched the moment in which a custodian activated the curse of balal from the control room of Frontier before dying. according to the credits the fellow is probably named Enki and that tiny bit of dialogue hints that he knew Fine so he may or may not be the "God" she was crazy for and he had reasons to activate the curse and not out of malice.
Their just showing how crazy/desperate they can be
Illuminaty fodder playing the psychological wargame on the gears
Someone seems to forget that abilities and whatnot r based by how much phonic they produce and combo and final season fight/moves they always get  superpowered by extra infinity phonic/alchemy gain
She might have also butchered the process too
Its a perfectly viable plan and dying didnt matter to her when she could switch to a new body whenever she pleased
What part dont u understand that her destroying that body was the start of the device, also to scar bikki, make them think she died and she was also suicidal
Watch them fix the number in the BD
NO. No Ver! I mean maybe as a flashback with no dialogue but thats it. He doesnt need to come back. His story done
We time traveling now
Except ur complaining because the series isnt doing things you wanted your way when they give a logical, tho badly presented/written, reason. EX. Carol fake dying
U overthink aalooot
For all we know SG couldve been treating them well offscreen. We just started the series dude. Wait for the eventual flashback and backstory
Cannon fodder and useless background ppl
Abd god power
They probably behaved to stay alive. Not gonna turn against what were the "strongest" of the illuminati. Failures true are still useful doesnt mean their part of the big scheme. Big scheme was always tiki
Their "failed experiments" in the pursuit of immortality or something
And he shouldnt hav pissed of SG
Adam didnt think about them in his plans cause Tiki and God power and he's a dumbass that thought he wouldnt loose because of the god power
Lol
They cant probably do squat. They may b failures but their still "monsters" and their fighting dirty
And maria AND KNUCKLES
Fine is now the scythe. We going Soul Eater mow
And Fine might hav also chosen to erase herself because every political power would try and look for her, hunt her descemdents, etc.
If the alchemy fodder r playing mindgames
Hey we might even get that answered too
It makes perfect sense that kiri doesnt want to use it cause very bad idea
Yeah but thats just mechajii. Combine that with the other gears and make a mecha Fine and punch Enki's killer
What i would have liked is a giant super robot Fine made from all the gears but thats never happening
Im scared for miku
For the last time Fine soul was destroyed. She went bye bye. Let it go. Just cause u werent wellversed on igalimas legend isnt an excuse to reject it has the fancy soul destroying power
Id imagine carol should comeback in some form. If crazy alchemy is at play might as well bring back the genius one
Did someone order EXTRA jam <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Things will get worse before we deus ex machina better
wait!... what if basa is the one who taught her how to be more flexible >>....
Kirika: so i can fight better i want to learn poledancing dess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> 
everyone: Kiri NO!
Kirika: Kiri dess!! <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
you know if the alchemist are planning to traumatize the team to get them out of the way how do you think they would do so for the rest? im guessing maria might be a bit out too since she was there with the basa thing and will have her hands full trying to help her, DMJii they might try to get them to hurt each other... or at least having Kirika accidentally cutting shirabe [even a small one]  to trigger her own PTSD, for chris they might destroy/blow up the school and she'll see all her background school friends hurt, for bikki miku would probably get injured in the crossfire and miku would watch bikki getting slapped around because she looses focus.... and then later in the series they kidnap miku.
oh hai purple star
well the other big thing was that quite a few of the "witch hunts" are started by families, friend and such from the victims of the concert. ex. the evil lil student bitch that started the bullying on bikki at school and the jackass of the company president that ruined topdads career.
well yes she got over it, or as best as we know cause sunshine, but i mean like people start throwing blame around again. one of the big things about that disaster is that when the death count came up and that a bunch of the victims were killed by survivors the population started to demonize all the survivors until it turned into a witch hunt
guys guys. what if. what if. with the hell of a disaster this concert was... what if it gets people talking about the zwei wing concert from s1 and whispers start moving around again until someone mentions that bikki survived that....
And now the gears also hav faust robe abilities and still being studied
Airgetlam is X cause no one knows what it is
I like the keyword about the serial numbers. Thats actually pretty neat
And at least XV fine keyword mentios a spear and a scythe or something like that and thats it
And its deus ex machina
Well keywords dont bother talking about the legends of any of the gears. Only later on they focus on at least Gungnirs legend
Well considering how dangerous it is yeah im not surprised
Pretty sure even CR mentions the soul rendering thing. At least i remember in the big fight. Cant remember if before
Fine was killed cause she had all the answers
yeah someone said each transformation is being made by someone else
imagine if this guy was in charge of shirabe? id imagine some rope play with the yo-yo moves just cause he could
yeah i think the thigh part is what gets me
mmm someone made a compilation of the kiri transformations [ugh terrible bg music. whynot just leave the regular stuff] looking at it sure kiri does some maneuvers and whatnot with the scythe but she doesnt do a pole dancing thing till the AXZ transformations and its not as "in your face". XV just went full pole dance
^
stoooooop~~~!! you're giving too much spoilers! i can't believe you all managed to get the scripts for future episodes. you are all insane
as great as an idea it would be to have Fine give answers she is dead and please let her stay dead and not bring her back from the dead because that would be just horribly bad. unless its a flashback but thats it.
and the kiri guy asked for kiri cause kiri fan
i was always of the impression that the more energy/armor she used for armor purge the less clothes she would have. so when she wuld go full blast armor purge she was literally throwing EVERYTHING. but of course AXZ Bikki happened and WELP
the return of daurdabla and elfrol sings Tomorrow instead of GENOCIDE
hmm besides the bdsm part none of the other naked/fanservice parts ever really bothered. her walking around naked seemed pretty in character for her
that english was beautiful and you should appreciate it more
at least we finally got what the dang gear codes mean XD
its adorable
i mean while riding the rocket scythe scene. pause it right and she's smiling with a little tongue sticking out. so very kiri
she is sticking her tongue out while doing that if u pause it too
rocket propelled scythe!!
oh yeah still had some amazing shots tho. that XIII was great and u could also get an XV out of it since she is doing the V
i guess everyone sure was expecting some crazy scythe maneuvers and naïve silly kirika but not full slow pole dance and thigh scene
200 episodes for a long running series is nothing tho
back to XV! someone quick think of something!
nah not really. part1&2 are the shortest and there is even a 3 part eps for it so you watch that instead. Part 3&4 drag from time to time. havent finished Part5
being solopy is suffering
Nessie the loch ness monster!
each one represents a monster. millarc and elsa [?] were literally made to recreate an actual vampire and werewolf and Vanessa because of what happened to her ends up being frankenstein just to stick to the theme
yeah says it in her bio. and she's using the same tech for her new limbs and whatnot
no. i think all of them were experiment on people. Vanessa was a scientist that got in an accident while working on faust robe tech
how main tarot cards are there? 24 right?
the worse cards are the tower and the devil if i remember right
well technically the death card isnt a bad omen. just represents the death of something for change or something like that so yeah she could
DESS obviously
^
and now im just imagining the autoscorers playing cards
truthfully when i think of the sword/staves/cups/coins i think of briscas
they have so many motives and they work amazing. and its just funny how the ovas tried to explain Micha's pose
I LIKE THE TAROT MOTIVES! also how all the Carol squad think Garie is trash!
^ *meanwhile bikki senses someone wanting hugs and starts running around like a maniac and just leaves the other gear users and friends just looking at her like she has a screw loose or in other words just bikki being bikki*
i mean considering the type of merch they sale. just some basic shirts, pins, towels, and even phone cases yeah a tarot deck would just poof away
"oh you wanted some symphogear tarot deck? i'm sorry you should've been here like last week before we even opened the site page <:Ver:336656981144109066>  "
dude dont worry those things would be sold out before we even got to look at them
oh wait its 22 main tarots
if the Custodian in the coffin ends up being the mastermind that killed Enki [assuming Enki isnt the baddie and tried to stop something or someone] then Coffin fellow could be the Devil
and uuuh who else? a Custodian and Enki maybe
if some get mixed together then you could have space for Nastassha too maybe
so... 9 gears, fine, ver, SG, Prelati, Cag, adam, tiki, Gen, Ogawa, Carol, Elfnien [ she is an actual tarot motive], Carol, Vanessa, Elsa, Millarc
And u need a lot of phonic to wake up relics
She needed durandal for kadingir. I guess she needed something to grant a looot of energy to blow up the moon
She lost by the power of friendship and willpower
Gen said it when he fought her
They knew Ryoko was probably the traitor They didnt know her full plans and needed her to continue
Uuh no they already found out. Chris just confirms what they knew
Sent plenty of noise after her
Noise actually self destruct on their own after a while
The attacks became more common cause Ryoko/Fine
The noise were random and sporadic. They could pop up once or twice a month or never again for like a year or so
Well she said she wanted to destroy the moon because the custodians cursed them when she wanted to confess her love to god
You also hav to remember that S1 was suppose to b a one off series. They didnt think it would do that well
And she likes breaking people
She was a relic fusion with a complete relic. Thought herself superior and didnt give a damn
And of course she was very interested in the gear system. It let her find a way to use fragments
She can only backstab the US for so long too you know
In fact i think he didnt do his strength training until AFTER kanade died. Not sure tho
If FINAL COMMANDER ends up being the final move then i better see them throwing a fire spirit of Gen if he dies
I love that line. Its just so silly and so Gen
Yuki was best character btw
Yeah he's crazy anime strong but he doesnt have superpowers. He wouldnt be able to do anything once she has solomons cane and durandal or when she went full dragon
Gen punches through Fine. Thinks he kills ger but SURPRISE she can regenerate and she stabs him
Eps. 4 is the bikki/chris break eps. by having the alchemists destroy the school
I just realized something... what if Fudou decides to take command of SONG
Its gonna end on a positive but things will get worse before they get better
I think at the very least the shirabe/basa unison did let them bond over having similar feelings regarding the kiri/kanade thing
And then Adam cheated
We got a little bit in AXZ with him and his brother trying to stop the alchemists
Since he's not the main focus we dont see all the things he has to do behind the scenes
The return of Apple!
Maria being useless or perhaps for once she uses her experiences that she fucked up a lot and you can get through it
All lead by elf9=justice putting it together
Gotta admit the upgrade in AXZ is my favorite. Kinda poetic since it culminates a bunch of enemies and allies work together
Chris always has that one fear of seeing her friends beaten to a pulp surrounded by destruction and loosing everything because its her fault
Millarc is what Maria wouldve been if she hadnt let the hostages go
Like the main reason there is no 2nd commander is because of Fudou to keep control of the Division
Im seriously worried if Gen would loose his position as commander since this is the 2nd concert catastrophe in his record. I could see Fudou using it as leverage to take back SONG since he did make Div2 but resigned for loosing ichibal
So i find it fair
This is the first time that basa sees a full attack during a concert since the zwei wing one. G Maria didnt wsnt casualties and let everyone go and GX they attacked afterwards behind the scenes
And the closest friends know about kiri and shirabe
And the lydian students at least know about basa and chris
At least maria and bikki should be known
G concert she was going to expose herself but ogawa cut the cameras on time
Watch as the shrine shirabe's possible grandfather works in is connected to everything. It is a shrine dedicated to the moon
Mi-llarc or something i guess.
Probably tried talking no jutsu but since Millarc doesnt give a damn the girl still gets stabbed
Just swimming in grief seed
To find the lost wing in her heart
Its gonna screw with basas head and then elf9 uses the helmet thing to jump into her head and we see Kanade help out
Last time basa had a bad vibe before a concert bad stuff happened
According to the bio Millarc only cares about Vanessa and Eliza and will do anything for them. To her everyone else is just cannon fodder that can b cast aside easily
And "if they come up with sonething good" is just subjective because if they do come up with something good but u didnt like it cause u wouldve preferred X then ur still going think its bad either way
But yes gimme nendos of the robos. They're perfect.
Oh and recently shirabe robo got an "upgrade" that lets her turn into a bigger medabot size version based on XDmecha shirabe that lets shirabe ride on it so id totally expect a future event in the future maybe
The end
and then elf9 fixes/rebuilds them as best she can but they lost their individuality from either damage or no relic energy BUT not to worry this is symphogear and the robos do talk back a bit so they can get their personalities back with AI DESU YO
Aand then the DMJii robos sacrifice themselves to save DMJii because AI DESU YO
And then FIS can fuse with their robos for fancy robogear
The evil clones also had an evil robo maria based on her black gungnir cause elf9 i think may have worked on it on the side or the relic made it instead
And in good old robo fashion they get affected by a relic and come alive to protect DMJii from the evil relic robo clones
And they can self destruct cause why not
Kiri gets shirabe robo and shirabe gets kiri robo
Elfnien made little robo versions for kiri and shirabe as bday presents for each of them
OMG YES ROBO NENDOS
Give me bike-kun figma instead
Statue yeah. A figma sadly no
I mean this is symphogear so i wouldnt put it pass them. They sorta did for Ver after all. I mean yeah he was backstabbing for the heck of it but still helped save the day and ai desu yo.
What nuuuu!!! We must fight to the death or something!
No redemption arc for her tho please
Mustve gotten messages mixed up in the sea of discord. I apologize
Fair enough
Well point was that u already stated u didnt like millarc for various reasons so i doubt that any plot point with her will change ur mind even if it ends up being a good plot point is what i meant
If its the same one im thinking of then yes that is the one we shall never mention again. It never happened shhhhhhh
Some are pretty good, some are meh and ones that should never be mentioned again
XDU is just an AU story where they had an extra relic called Gallahorn that eventually wakes up and opens portals to other AUs and they also come up with the silly nonsense that the Gears can alter themselves for all the alter costumes
<:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
the appropriate thing to do while listening to the kiri song is much headbang
Them timely screenshots yoh
Oh and the shoes too
Well id probably expect a very nice boob/butt focus when they form the crystal on her chest and the skirt piece but then loads and loads of daka
Watch her pull red hot blaze in the transformation
Id expect shirabe to take the hit. Not chris
These guys are doing what FIS shouldve done. Where's that meme with the Alch team going "im you but better" at FIS. Now it seems appropriate and this time they were messing with Maria's girlfriend
It shouldve been a regular building and Millarc would just bomb the exists so people couldnt escape during the massacre
Wheres that pic of the dog sitting at a table surrounded by fire
Its fine. Its fine.
And it was more of a temporary diversion last time
So was in S1 and people still lived. Then again Kanade zesshou last time
Cause Basa didnt get her own Bikki this time <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
NO. it beats the S1 disaster by 1 extra dead person
Im expecting a bunch of people died and a whole lot more killed each other just for extra S1 callback.
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2019-07-16/symphogear-xv-main-animator-yoshiyuki-okubo-explains-why-kirika-transformation-is-not-sleazy/.148842
do remember they were also afraid of her and behaved till they found out she died/got her ass kicked by the Gear squad
And the chest armor
Whipsword and flying knives and focus on that arm
Instead of lewd its the most dang cute thing ull ever see
Because she was trying to do everything for shirabe
And so if Shirabe wasnt going to b in the world then she didnt want to b either
Ur also forgetting that not only was kiri wrong but the one disappearing was shirabe
I still want a MaBasa fight song dang it
KiriBikki... well its bikki she trusts 100% and kiri being genki #2
Chris and Maria hav war backgrounds and loosing loved ones to shitty people/reasons
I CAN see shirabe singing with basa as both (well basa in the past) were fairly reserved, hav partners and shirabe well just talking to someone who gets it and basa being a sempai
That has more to do with writing than anything
They never thought to combine their gears before tho
Its just coming to an understanding. Gen kinda says so. They must learn to understand each other better. That was it. No matter how different the gear/relics are they still share the same beginning
Its just ghe usual peoples feelings coming together to create a miracle this time through song and love and understanding
The answer is AI DESU YO
Not really. Considering what phonic represents or some such it makes sense. Iv watched too much anime that hav used similar plot points and all explain similarly so i just fill in the gaps
It was terrifying she was goibg to disappear but it destroyed her more that it was shirabe who would instead even if the world is saved
It wasnt random because shirabe was going to disappear
Of course kiri wanted to live because she was dang scared of what was happening to her but above all else she wanted to protect shirabe as long as she ciukd while she was still herself
Btw its not out if nowhere that the whole world can build phonic when the whole point if the zwei wing concert in S1 was to wake up nehushtan
Point blank says if shirabe isnt around anymore she didnt want to b either
But u were saying that its out of nowhere that kiri would try to kill herself when there is a whole lot of dang build up
All she had and that matter was Shirabe and she was going to disappear
Now finds out the world is ending and is trying to help save. She thinks she cant trust maria and ma'am anymore because they lied to them and she also thinks she's Fine and Ver being a snake manipulates her and she falls for it
Especially shirabe
She survived it all because she made close connections with shirabe and maria and ma'am
Dude just cause kiri didnt show it doesnt mean she didnt hav it. She was an orphan forgotten by society and stolen by a crazy organization to b used in their experiments to make weapon/soldiers
Yeah im pretty sure those are just alcanoise
Yeah they were dang great
Also unison is a prank
DMJii carrying the team MVP
he was always a piece of shit worse than topdad. considering he thinks his 2 sons are failures and slept or probably raped basa's mom who was yatsu's wife...
watch him pull a Gurren Lagann kinda end if anyone gets what im referring to
truthfully i dont want basa to fight him. i want the kazanari bros to get in fudous way so basa can go sing while she gives fudou the middle finger
or kazanari children vs fudou. just have them do some sorta tri-attack hyper combo finish and make him shut the fuck up
and then either Gen or Yatsu become the head of family cause neither one want Basa to take that seat so she can go and fly and sing as much as she wants. Probably Yatsu. yeees and then he can have even more connections to blackmail people so he can get whatever Basa wants at any given time
well he didnt become peak physical fitness until after the zwei wing concert but still
But tiki did get the ascension by using the gate of heaven and well bikki didnt know how to control the thing so yeah
Hell Prelati helped her with the dang castle
Im surprised they let her make the castle/use it. Less her Faust Robe tech and such was still more advance and they didnt complete their own research yet
Adam was a useless dumbass. He just took the stuff that was completed by others
It was a give/take between them with Carol being smarter probably
She did a lot of crazy illuminati experiments and they took it
Bad enough he popped up for AXZ
Mememan did his part let him stay gone dammit
Elf9 is fine. Its just that the writers screw her up and not letting her get actual spotlight
Carol sees the 3 stooges: you all suck. Here i fix you up now get the heck out of my sight
Carol comes back to fix the 3 idiot illuminati
Well obviously gonna get kidnapped and possesed by an evil god probably
Also farfetch to think that the 3 illuminati have anything to do with the reincarnation ability. Their not that old and are failures of the monster recreation and immortal body project. I feel sad for them tho since they probably want divine power to make themselves human
Perfect body or not Basa still has the "original sin" so she still wouldnt be an "ideal" vessel for Fudo for reincarnation games now that he probably knows about Bikki and Miku being free of it and can even wield divine power
Crazy theory be crazy. Possible but crazy. I could believe Fudo and the Kazanari being a descendent/reincarnation of a Japanese God, very likely Susanoo. Him being Enil, nah... though if the "Gods" have a tendency to "reincarnate" in a new vessel then maybe that explains why Enki stopped Fine and cursed humanity. Some Annunaki wanted her to be a new vessel and he didnt want that.
They'll get pity arcs, probably wanting divine power to complete themselves, and get killed
Vanessa uses Faust Robe tech for her cyborg parts. Inb4 she gets her ass kicked, is brought to SONG, elf9 wants to save her but Carol was more wellversed in Faust Robe tech, finally channels Carol who gives her the knowledge, saves Vanessa
Plottwist she has a fragment of daurdubla in her lab as a memento for studies
Their part Faust Robe now
Uuuh dansleif was sacrificed to channel the alchemy energy cause it wasnt phonic and the old gear system couldnt channel anything that isnt phonic
Its one of the things i like about the Rebuild in AXZ. All the theories of all the villains culminating being brought together by elf9/justice culminating into the new gear system
Really ignite was sacrificed so the gears can now hav the ability to convert alchemy energy
Id say they equaled XD with all that alchemy energy at the end if AXZ but now that they dont hav it their back to standard in XV
Besides Bikki in base gear and SG cut his arm off
Mmm maybe
Adam would get bitchslapped by Carol
Nehustan eats at the host. Divine Power connects u to space/time/whatever for infinite lives cheat code
Hmm probably?
I kno but it was a cute progress showing they might b working on it
Offscreen were slowly getting along
Meanwhile Yatsu was growing as a good person and Basa was being so proud of him
He'd just "oh i simpky lost ichibal. U let the same disaster happen twice"
Same
The minute they mentioned he "slept" with his son's wife to breed a pure breed sword heir and hence said son was being cruel to her to make her hate/leave the family for her safety he was obviously going to be a perfect villain
Inb4 bikki erases the divine power itself like she erased the curse of the pharaoh
Remember their cowards and therefore not afraid to get their hands dirty, inb4 millarc or vanessa punches through him from behind
Just useful for him to force Basa to become a sword and him getting the gauntlet
He already considers them as disposable
And mock him instead
Other option is the trio backstabs/kills Fudo giving him a pathetic death for being a dick
Lmao
Lol
Thus supporting the economy?
I buy their merch
If they die by the gears or fudo their "best" death is dying as the Noble RED and then Fudo mocks their deaths cause he's a dick
And itll very likely be fudos fault less the gears kill them beforehand
Yeah their gonna die
Probably wanting divine power to create a place for themselves or complete themselves to b free
Their incomplete monsters, considered failures by the illuminati and despised by others, only had each other to count on, need specific blood to live, are weak and hunted wherever they go and will do anything for each other.
oh and ED comes out august 21
says shirabe july 24th, chris is july 31st, maria august 7 and tsubasa august 28
shirabe comes out in 2 days
so is the Metanoia OP single
no bikki and kiri CDs r out
i dont think its out yet?
inb4 the custodians want to turn humanity into kool-aid
Fixed <:Ver:336656981144109066>
S1 - Mureca gets trolled by a crazy priestess and even fail to kill her
G - Mureca gets robbed by an old woman, a madman, an idol and 2 kids and fails to off them too
GX - Nothing. Elections maybe?
AXZ - Fails to nuke Japan
XV - gets robbed again this time by ex-illuminati monsters working for an old man
Only time they werent involved was GX i think
They couldnt even kill the crazy priestess right either
Lol
it's beautiful <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
watch enough anime to get the dango reference and i guess neapolitan is a pretty good choice for "localization" or the closest anyone could come up with.
Don't think so?
All Ver would hav had to do to convince Miku is tell her he knew about the RelicCancer and that maybe juuust maybe a cure could be found in Frontier and that be enough
Plottwist its bikki saying she wants to touch elsa's doggy ears cause their fluffy cute and is apologizing
Tricking everyone and then using the power of song that she had just learned about to summon the damn world snake to destroy the multiverse. A nice entrance.
Well considering who the new main villain is in xdu i guess u at least hav the insane cute part.
Giant mecha arm fists is Yuki Yuna
Plottwist its SG fault they couldnt get out of the bubble "stay out of our way. Gonna clean this mess"
Maria with serena and basa with kanade
Guys guys Gen dies and FINAL COMMANDER is they summon Genjuro for a super gear
Awesome
Well bikki, kiri and shirabe cds are out so you might want to get started <:KirikaApproval:586957465552158720>
I just wonder if the hanasuki duet will b a BD extra. Hope so
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
When it comes out
And conspiracies
It means more plot
Looks like a spider
Standing like a boss all torn up
Z end obviously
If Vanessa is a Mazinger reference then expect a mazinger end for her
Wonder what other mazinger or Dynamic ref Vanessa could do
Probably berserk
Shhhh no one needs to know that
Well u can see some of the cubes kinda morphed so their not all perfectly square
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
So much stuuuuuuff to choose from
Oooof Harlock. Now im remembering his finishing move in SRWT
Chris already did in AXZ
Mecha sports
And doesnt need to just reference Gunbuster. There is iron leaguer too
BUT u can see the bat in the transformation in the anime
For shits and giggles give Buster Home Run. Gotta slam something with a baseball bat
And that time she kicked Carol. Good times
Well every Rider Kick is an Inazuma Kick so close enough
Oooh Thunder Break
Breast of Fire, Photon Beam, Getter Beam, Getter Tomahawk (could see Millarc pull some shin getter stunt with the wings), Buster Collider
Watch her pull a Honey Flash at some point
Come to think about it.... Vanessa sorta looks like a mix of Jun from Great Mazinger and Hurricane Honey from Cutey Honey
And then she passed that move to Diana and then Venus
Aphrodite is such a classic
But yeah its very likely they all die as Noble Red
Or 4th scenario and makes everyone rage all 3 live
Or becoming "complete"
3 scenarios, all  three die, elsa dies, vanessa and millarc die with elsa living and gaining a human body
We're just getting some screen time of them so we feel a bit bad for them later
Basa would also feel responsible for millarc since it was her grandfather who pretty much used her for his own personal gain
Millarc says she is weak hence y she did what she did. Basa could probably answer that she is stronger for not commiting to the same act like she did and go of to hunt Fudo instead
Yeah but just as likely basa would let her live once she finds out it was ordered by Fudo
Either he does know or doesnt and is about to find out
He takes over SONG, checks their data, finds out about miku, kidnaps her, puts the gauntlet on her, ???, profit
everyone at SONG gets arrested and Ogawa busts them out and then Gen commences the beatdowns
so you'd either have to sell your soul to get the boxset because it does include it or by some miracle discotek includes some music cds or something but nah
still so freaking cool
and an axz artbook?
i see some... blurry symphogear manga back there
oh wow <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
it is
Nah thats just an ordinary hat  if it had been a nokia they'd all be fucked
The hat ascended
Well it was SG gun but it was Prelatis ultimate alchemy bullet and i guess all their lifeforce got merged together when they died so just got caught in the ride too
And its not far fetch we saw heard/saw SG. Bikki heard her voice b4 in axz that it wasnt over when Adam was being a dick after they sacrificed themselves
Oh and im sure we could see prelati and cag at some point too maybe. They did talk in the final fight with SG in AXZ
Note that the alchemists had a very pseudo divine power by making fake gods just from peoples belief and the life energy of a couple of dead people
Inb4 all this time the divine power is made by killing humanity. To ascend and gain it the custodians killed their slaves. They also posses a new human body everytime they were going to die too. and Enki said "fuck that no" and sealed the system. That power isnt very picky when you think about it unless you're "cursed"
If miku does feel guilty for zwei wing concert, whether because she gave her the ticket or for simply not going and simply being there with her, then bikki b-side answers her that she doesnt think that way and that miku showed her there was a light afterwards too and all that love turned her into the uncool hero that she is now for her.
Its pretty much all her thank yous and love to miku for being there for her
Or sings it as a desperate move to reach a possesed miku in the final fight too
Call out to chris and zababa doing similar back in G
Bikki b-side id imagine her singing it in the school stadium as either a last exam or part of a festival
Which song? SSJ? or the other bikkimiku duet? Been a while since i last read the lyrics. If its SSJ well u gotta remember bikki is denser than a harem protagonist
NO give us a new bikkimiku duet finally answering each other
Gungnir is a philosophical armament powered by belief. Yeah i could still see its power manifesting even after destruction because bikki channels it in her hand because bikki's belief lies in handholding
And then THIS IS OUR SYMPHOGEAR or THIS IS OUR SONG or something
And then GUNGNIR DATTO
Nah more likely for gungnir to b destroyed only for its power to still manifest in bikkis hand by handholding with miku thanks to their combined love and trust in each other
Well considering the life force of "three perfect beings" was absorbed by them... probably yes
Great im imagining him throwing his papers in frustration everytime he's forced to put something in. But then duet happened and aoi giv the sad eyes cause it was fun and he just stares and then throws his papers with a serious face and just says "fuck it lets put it in. It was too awesome dammit"
That duet shouldve happened in AXZ and shouldve been a BD extra or an extra in the live BD but noooooo they didnt so fans demanded that awesome duet and now we get duet
Yes its a waste from the fusion but that fusion was bikki fused with gungnir. Probably any fusion case could make it but this specific material was from the bikkigungnir fusion. More of a poetic reason if anything.
Also this bit:
"The nickname given to the unanalyzed substance that once fell off of Hibiki's chest." - keyword
Oh and we forgot the fool stone. Made from bikki and kanade gear
Just as Fujitaka surmised in episode 5, the Symphogears held by F.I.S. were developed by Fine personally from relics she had gathered, including Gungnir of which she took a fragment of directly from Division 2 - keyword piece
And then XDU made it better by having bikki talk to the Kanade that sleeps within her heart to save her. Because even if Kanade's Gungnir is gone, her song is not and as long as she remembers/believes in the song in her heart she is never alone
Whether she took that piece before or after kanade joined is the question tho
Black Gungnir is a piece of Kanade's Gungnir. Fine stole it during her time in Div2
Inb4 bikki and basa fight in XV and bikki channels Kanade's will to punch some sense into Basa
Come to think about it... Bikki was already curse free when she stole blackgungnir and did the swirl of light before serena popped up. In GX both elf9 and alchdad manifested through bikki's hand or around her. In AXZ bikki could hear SG before adam took her spellcaster and still heard them before she testament his face in
And Bikki is curse free. Extra understanding
When people learn to understand each other you can even talk to ghosts from beyond
SG yeah she's in the Gear
Kanade was cause basa had a near death experience. id imagine serena was a miracle of phonic gain/zesshou
They do happen naturally from to time. Normally very random and sporadic sometimes even years apart and in the middle if nowhere but ever since Fine woke up they started popping up all the time.
I think XDU gave as more info. Took her a year to activate it but she needed to train for six months or something
Give or take yeah
She can summon but cant control
Well she did simply throw Noise around at random to cause havoc. At least we kno she caused the slaughter of Kanade's hometown(?) and the deaths at Zwei Wing. And probably any weird Noise outbreak
The big questions
Also we kno that millarc killed 70k people in a single moment and SG roughly 70k overtime but how many did Fine kill in all her lifetimes HMMMMM
First CR and then the WORLD <:Ver:336656981144109066>
In fact let YMTM take over CR <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Better Petition to hav someone more competent take over
Except its probably ancient lost language so no one understands it anyways so they still forget <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Cause i wouldnt b surprised if humanity went after her for revenge or something when the fall happened. She led them and they all got screwed over. The zesshou "translation" is literally "hey its Fine's fault. Never forget."
Like take Chris old backstory and multiply it by 10k or something
So yeah im not surprised she'd be pretty fucked up
Whatever wars that happened were bad enough to make everything a myth/fairytale if it werent for the existence of noise and fragments
Probably because of how she acted/spoke about ancient humanity. She probably did used to believe in people and was the leader to find the alternative but like she said instead of working together they turned on each other and humanity created the noise
True but she didnt make them. She'd had to get that info first. At the very least it was her own research/study that was probably used to make them. Just like how she says "all the relics are hers". Probably the one creation she hates most considering how she reacted to bikki "humanity created the noise"
Probably learned about the cane in her studies
So some evil idiot forgot to close the door or left it open for countless millenia. Fine studied it, figure out how to manipulate that opening.
She said the door/gate was already slightly open hence y they could pop up randomly. She learned how to summon them by taking advantage of that opening
And then revives like 1k years later and humanity enslaved by the custodians and be all "F*CK!"
And then screws up cause "herpaderp ima fusion now". Wonder what she would hav thought if she had known about the nasty side effect. Probably not do it or not care and still do it to fast forward anyways and "hey im immortal. Retry #5k"
Just add "acquires and does a lot of shit b4 getting chris"
Yes
Yeah pretty much
Wasnt also a big reason for div2 to get her was cause she was a candidate? Gen was suppose to take custody after the recovery
Couldve sworn it said she was missing again
She gets the cane at some point and gets chris to activate it sometime after zwei wing/ before main story probably
Oh and Fine explained the gate/door to the noise was already slighty open so she took advantage of that to naturally summon them to wreck havoc
Yeah found it. Its 3.5 she talks about the activation
And their talking about the lack of linkerk and their low output
When bikki and chris are training with kiri and shirabe
I think its in 3.5
im just recalling the nanoha 1st movie drama cd. nanoha and vivio r going to a movie studio because they want to make a movie about nanoha hence we got the movie. so the utazukin movie would be "similar"
an utazukin movie then
and i know exactly what the next gear project could be after gear. an actual spin-off adaption of the red singing hood
plottwist miku never gets kidnapped/involved at all
miku kills him after loosing control of the divine power <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
oh yeah he's gonna kill an alchemist or someone at some point. less he does end up getting trolled by an alchemist instead.
basa tries and bikki stops her because she doesnt want her to hurt herself like that leading to the long awaited fight between the both of them
*insert opm theme song*
Gen punches fudo instead
Miku with the bracelet almagams with bikki
They produce so much godly energy, merging with everything in its wake in the final battle that bikki, miku and elfrol must fly away with it and crash land on Mars. Overtime they merge with the planet becoming an omnipotent powerful being that traverses the universe and continues to grow as it feeds on other planets and races <:Ver:336656981144109066>
yea. its kinda obvious when we know what's suppose to happen [that miku will get the bracelet at some point] so her getting kidnapped is kinda obvious so nothing seriously bad can happen to her. elfnien being a target was suprising tho, probably because we're too focused on miku and yet makes perfect sense because the only "greatest" alchemist left with knowledge on faust robes and gears. also carol.
wait does that mean that kadingir was also made with nokia? or partially anyways
the secrets to the ultimate armor is nokia
well you had her, prelati and elfnien working on the thing for who knows how long. gotta be dang durable and solid to fly it around
Dont forget when good LNs get bad adaptions
My IQ has gone done just hearing about that. That is beyond stupid
Chris going Heavy Arms is always good
Tetsujin is the grandpa to everyone. A good grandpa UNLIKE a certain terrible grandpa in Gear
Its probably they just screwed up something in production
I dont think so? Don't all bikki's CDs come out b4 her 2nd songs ever pop up in the show?
Well if they replicate faust robe tech they wont need symphogears anymore. Mass produced Faust Robes. The original symphogears are kept by the original squad or, after passing or retiring, are kept in a special high security vault. That or they get destroyed at the end of XV
Maybe with all the hype and the series ending we might get some damn figmas of the squad. One could dream <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
And yes dang NoWaYu so much feels
Yeah all Yuna VNs have been tl.
Yuki yuna was decided since day one to b a multi franchise product so yes loads of stuff everywhere even in the video game
The b-side songs thing could b easily fixed if they had just used them as alter endings with still images focusing on every day life of the specific character but nope
What about spanish? Anyone else who speaks it how do you grade it.
Ok got off my lazy bum and heard/read Maria's songs. that is some fine quality good stuff right there. and feels. dont forget the feels
Let Carol turn Vanessa into a super robot!
No not yet but maybe starting a backup plan. In the end they just want to be human again or hey maybe Carol fixes their defects at least
Yeah but he's no protagonist
Vanessa - ok listen. We kno Fudo is shit and is gonna backstab us. This bikki kid is much much stronger and at least nice and we fucked up and we are in serious shit. So we gonna start switching sides here so we dont get even more fucked than we already are before shit hits the fan. In the meantime go grab that lil gremlin alchemist of theirs. We need her and we also gotta make this believable. Oh an off that creepy guy. He looks like a pedo and i dont like him.
Everything shall become hibiki
Only the power of handholding can save the world
Watch him hint song to the location of NR so Basa can kill them
No! She's a wing!
Millaarc is a chuni who took her chuni too far
If she does itll either b bikki or maria. Heck maybe chris
Or maria ends up saying something similar
Ghost kanade reminder her that if she's too tense she'll break
U know that eye patern looks like the mask tiki used to have
Its very creepy looking egg. Looks like it has a one-eyed angry baby face
Lulu Amel is ancient humanity
a silver arm indeed
solid dakka is good dakka
well i mean technically i think chris does it with lasers iirc
everything else was trash
yeah dont remind me of that scene. i just like the mecha
well other option is another yukiyuna reference and she gets a giant floating boat platform with cannons or a valvrave ref with her getting a bunch of mecha arms and their holding guns
its over 70K
or just like gungnir the legend got mixed
it could be? what if Nuada's silver arm ended up being made from Enki's silver arm
well i guess "names" don't get altered in chants.
and then go more meta. if the word "tron" in the chants ends up meaning "love/blessing" like the theories think then part of the chant literally means "silver arms love" therefore Enki's love!
either by a gear or maybe Gen doing the same thing back in S1 for another callback
she tries to kill a civilian and gets blocked would be more likely
just simply hurting/injuring someone during the rampage wouldve broken her
hnnn hopefully i quoted that right but yeah this was it. mindblown btw
```Kerrik52, Bearer of 291 DupesLast Thursday at 8:57 AM

The temple of Bêl, the Babylonian Zeus [...] was still in existence in my time. It has a solid central tower, one stadium square, with a second erected on top of it and then a third, and so on up to eight. All eight towers can be climbed by a spiral way running round the outside, and about half way up there are seats for those who make the ascent to rest on. On the summit of the topmost tower stands a great temple with a fine large couch in it, richly covered, and a golden table beside it. The shrine contains no image, and no one spends the night there except (if we may believe that Chaldaeans who are the priests of Bêl) one Babylonian woman, all alone, whoever it may be that the god has chosen. The Chaldaeans also say -though I do not believe them- that the god enters the temple in person and takes his rest upon the bed.{{Herodotus, Histories 1.181-182; tr. Aubrey de Sélincourt}}

I just wanted to take a second to inform everyone that the reason we don't have a Hibiki in this world is because in our timeline, FINE GOT TO FUCK GOD."```
and speaking of Fine, that bit of myth/hystorical info someone dropped over in Symphogear Discussion a couple of days ago should've been posted here too. it was too mindblowing lol
and continue with the irony that he may have reciprocated her feelings and died, probably assassinated, trying to protect her and humanity and she never knew and never found out and her life ended thinking he betrayed her. or even if she had succeeded in reaching the heavens like she intended then she would've found out he died
maybe
SSJ replicas
it could happen if basa tries to kill miku or something
there is just so many gear vs tsubasa fights its hard to choose which one itll be. i mean yeah probably maria or maybe maria/chris. would love a bikki one too
What i dont get is if she succeeded in getting miku hit by SSJ's light or miku removed it herself. If its the former then yeah sad end. If its the latter then worse end cause miku should also b dead <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
WELP is not like i needed my heart anymore <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
BANG <:ChrisCharge:586320496346529792>
but if you loose control of the weapon it is a good idea to have something to counter it. and obviously only a god-killer can kill a god. luckily since Bikki is Bikki Fudo can't control the Bikki.
but then again gurren lagann in general homaged so much mecha you could probably find something to another mecha in it
all that was missing were the boomerang shades
nah that one was definitely gurren lagann down to the posing and follow up with carol and whatnot. the tekkeman stuff and the getter one are pushing it too hard tho.
didn't realize GG was older than GGG. i just simply looked up the dates and surprise suprise. go fig
but quite a lot of gear moves do tend to be references to mecha or other anime just for extraness and easter eggs and just plain awesome and obvious callbacks to animations the staff worked on too so you can't deny that
raideen does it? ill probably have to look it up cause didnt know
presentation wise anyways
but it is a reference to hyper mode. i assume saint seiya does it but if you wanna go mecha it should probably be G Gundam and not GGG. G gundam is '94, GGG is '97.
the getter one might be pushing it a bit i guess. might as well ref all of chris gundam moves
but it forgot the boob missiles. 0/10!
that is some dang good mecha ref
fair enough
True but the "newest/closest" one would be that one
The 4 arms would be more yuki yuna anyways
Id believe Gen ref Ryona would be more likely than the helmet thing. Big buff martial arts master and even the same dang VA. Nothing like punching dinosaurs you know
The getter one is one id say
If u dont mind the terrible subs then CR should hav it up in like an hour iirc? If u want the good stuff that will b longer
Yes perfect
We shall speak in the language of scream
No one talk about this eps for the next 24hrs to avoid spoilers and only respond with intense screaming if you did see it yet
Just saying anyone who watches this eps should prooobably find a place to scream loudly
accidentally got spoiled. Quietly intense screaming
Gotta break the mind b4 u can take over
Or she is the equivalent if the cranky granpa telling those 3 kids to get out of her house
Carol is there to collect all the unpaid rent those 3 owe
Who will win. Three failed monsters. One tiny miracle killer.
She said miracle. Prepare to get rekt.
She learned a new trick
Wait didnt the silhouttes of the "gods" in AXZ look like SSJ. Fetus seems to hav some tiny horns on the sides of its head
The suit/outfit is sorta looking like Enki's just white/purple
U were to distracted by the hype
Inb4 carol helps the gears or bikki destroy the divine power because nothing says miracle killer than killing the power of god
Who wins. Magic revolver gun or 1 misly finger
More likely bikki and miku loose their divine status
Inb4 carol is the one that looks at basa and just point blanks says in front of everyone how basa has her brain fried. "So weak you let urself get mindcontrolled symphogeah?"
They bullied elf9 and now they have one tiny miracle killing loli about to rekt their whole careers
Yes. Michas changes
Sawblades and yo-yos
Also play on words since dess/death sound similar
Sassy lost child
Eh who knows what crazy things can happen
Inb4 godmiku "curses" bikki so she cant use gungnir so she cant fight since its implied that its because of her curse free state that she can use gungnir
Hibiki is custom martial arts movies
Airgetlam is many things because no one knows what it was suppose to b and slapped a name on it just to code it
Megaman gear!
Buts suppose to b an arm
Yeah for now airgetlam is jackofalltrades
Well basa's dad yatsu is also good once u kno what he tried to do
But do note in the end she does say that miracles and curses are one and the same
Carol hates miracles because a "miracle" killed her father and therefore wants to destroy them all and thus she calls herself a miracle killer
He absorbed most/all the reverse energy backlash from chateu hence y FIS team lived
No. He injected nephilim cells in his arm and somehow became part relic tho idk how the eff that bypasses the fusion problem
He outlived his usefulness. he should not b back unless its either another flashback scene cameo or the nephilim cells were recovered and used in an experiment
Gaijin reaction meme
Someone mentioned something about them wanting to use the autoscorers as the gaijin or something
What really surprises me is that she had daurdabla
Because adam isnt a carol doll
They r in the freaking chateu, carol's castle yeah she's gonna have broken spares
Yeah
Nah adam is dead and already did his cameo
Shirabe came from a good family. At least we kno her possible granpa is a good person
Akira used to b a good dad n then shit happened n he was really a pathetic weak man that couldnt handle the stress of it all
The devil kicks everyone out cause he's tired of all these idiots trashing his place
Gen and Yatsu vs Fudo
Inazuma as in lightning kick from gunbuster
Okonomiyaki woman is actually a retired custodian just living a quiet simple life
Id say maybe good side but thats not gonna stop her from being a dick to everyone for screwing up
She used to sacrifice memories to boost power. She doesnt hav that excess power anymore
Daurdabal is suppose to b a relic combined with faust robe tech iirc. So im surprised its still around
Supposedly Justice card
Well do remember elf9 was doing memory experiments with the helmet so
She might b indifferent but interested about whats going on
oh u dont have rent money? thats ok! ill just tear u apart and dissect u all and use u as spare parts and whatnot. maybe i can use some of u to fix my autoscorers
id imagine his body was recovered and dissected and they recovered samples of nephilim at least
carol so OP and knowledgeable and just sleeping nice and comfy in her penthouse headspace and then this bitch of a fake vampire just trespassing into her head house
cause its cool <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
that face should be an emote
which gives a new perspective on carol and the autoscorers judging the gears singing during their fights
from an XDU sidequest story - she literally drags elf9 to karaoke thinking its some sorta singing training device. elf9 scores higher than her. insert karoake "battle". at the end she swears to bring the autoscorers as well so they too may be trained
worse. ever seen the mac n'cheese scene from courage the cowardly dog? yeah i could see carol doing something like that
Congrats
Well shit, went and DLed the ED theme CD. listened to the third song "IF THE WORLD HAD A SONG" because of a comment earlier. headcanonning hard that chris parents used to sing it to her and maybe even sang it during their volunteer work too and now im freaking emotional imagining it.
Elfnein is small cause u need to expend more energy for the change. Might as well focus it all on major asskicking instead
The full merge could be the real "carol" or as close to it as it can be
Either Carol disappears after some heartwarming stuff with elfnien or they finally fully merge with elfnein as the main personality inheriting everything that was left of carol. Point is closure for both of them
The subbers need to calm down from the intense hype to work and they gonna get extra hype again as they work. They hype train will never stop
It make sense when they share "similar" backgrounds. Both lost parents to bombings/terrorist atks. Lost loved ones to shitty people being shitty. And carry lots of guilt for past crimes
Maria is hanging out with Chris because Basa is being cold to everyone and Chris is everyones couple therapist
Did she just call herself Shem-Ha? Because if so looks like that yes the Gods possess lala lumiel for new bodies whenever they "die" and Enki cursed humanity to fuck them up and keep them away from his precious Fine.
Unless SSJ is just one of many. Like minor replicas if Shem-Ha
Behold the ultimate alchemist
Fair enough
U sure? I feel like they look a lil different. Maybe its just me
They r upgraded
ÀAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA
Let us speak the language of our people!
Yeah assuming the curse is meant to shut the gods up then bikki gonna punch the moon to fix/complete enki's "curse" probably
<:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
After hanging out at SONG im not surprised she learned a whole lot more about hax skills
Maria+Chris vs Basa sounds dang good
Fudou uses this as an excuse to go to war or something, other plottwist is siding with shem-ha until further notice to steal the divine power for himself
Inb4 kiri is another half sibling of basa
No one is gonna die and they will not ascend. We gonna punch shem-ha off of her and then fudou will try to absorb it and then we kill fudou probably
Waiting for METANOIA final attack
So how many new icon ideas u got from this season so far <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Ill giv him that but there was no reason to fuck up tsubasa so he lost all points
Id say the god/nuke strike in axz was the last straw for him
didnt someone reverse the colors in the scene with the miku dress and she pops up as a white silhouette and the background is space
tho obviously would try to rule the world too once he killed the gods
yes. something something wanting the god power to destroy whatever was hiding in the ice
oh and shem-ha looks just like the silhouettes that Adam showed back AXZ too
or it absorbed the the mirror fragments that surrounded the bracelet too
i do find it interesting how much shem-ha looks like SSJ. or should we say SSJ looks like shem-ha. i know that a wielders personality decides their Gears looks but Gears do tend to keep similar aesthetics no matter the user. and looking at them side by side its just too much a coincidence. either SSJ was the closests they got to replicate the god power or maybe it might have been used by minor gods or soldiers loyal to the annunaki
Shem-Ha is the name of the bracelet and the name of the God hiijacking Miku.
ripped a piece of it made one gear. the rest of the mirror kept in storage maybe? lead to believe it was "all destroyed". reality Fudou confiscated the thing
Ryoko found a large ass mirror tho
now hibiki must go further beyond and become a kami goroshi goroshi goroshi!
Fudou wanting to merge the shem-ha with the fragments to give it anti-relic powers therefore countering the god-killer. kami goroshi goroshi!
inb4 elf9/Carol find them dying from blood poisoning and figure out how imperfect and fucked up their bodies are. elf9 feels sorry for them and offers to help them in exchange for them to stop being shits and just tell them who the fuck they work for. try to join but of course Millaarcs mindflay on Basa screws up the team up which may lead to basa leaving
yeah the BD version for GX had all the people erased by the Chateau come back to life
both fine and carol killed people because they didnt give a shit. SG killed with reason. id say Prelati and Cag would kill and not give a shit but they would follow SG's orders first and foremost
carol nearly destroyed the world and the only reason everyone came back to life is because they manage to reverse the effects. bikki still tried to befriend her
carol is gonna fix their faust robes and whatnot cause elf9 will feel sorry for them
to destroy the device that causes the curse perhaps. if the curse really is meant to protect humanity from the "gods" then shem-ha would want it gone. or simply just use it to her advantage because "Enki was a fool wasting his time and ill take full advantage of his stupidity"
anyways in Gear we know that Fine united humanity to create the tower to confess her love to God and was willing to accept her own personal punishment. she says the custodians destroyed the tower. despite feeling betrayed and the hell she went through across the ages she still loved god and wanted to try again no matter what. now in XV we saw the mysterious Enki missing an arm and dying while putting up the curse because he had to and begging Fine for forgiveness
dude chill on the caps lock
in babylonian myth or whatever the annunaki created the lala lumiel to be their slaves and whatnot because annunaki are dicks and thought themselves far to superior to do labor work. they eventually joined together to try overthrow god hence the tower of babylon and so the annunaki [or god depending on the myth] became angry for their insolence and cursed them by taking their mutual language and whatnot. unable to come together they split into groups across the world becoming the first civilizations of humanity.
ancient humanity
shem-ha monologuing how inferior humans are and were nothing but slaves and livestock yet one of the gods had the audacity to think that lala lumiel were equal and had the right to be free and so betrayed them because he fell in love with one. insert a flashback of Enki seeing Fine
and Enki said "fuck no stay away from my woman"
maybe Fine was going to be Shem-Has fancy new vessel
obviously shem-ha or other gods possesing lala lumiel
tho perhaps maybe they did end up coming to understand each other and its just referenced in the CTF lyrics
with a light god could not know <:Ver:336656981144109066>
we can just blame the curse of balaal and simply them getting along because communicating beyond the concept of words
i dont think more episodes were needed but maria couldve just said some lines about how she knows how chris felt about her guilt and feeling the lose of loved ones since she lost her sister and yadah yadah
Apple is used to save Miku
if good writting had happened we wouldve gotten lots of talk of how similar their lives were and bond about it but of course not.
he has a stab wound on his chest and is missing an arm. that and the character bios/description imply that airgetlam may in fact be his arm because airgetlam isnt its real name and just had a name slapped on it to give it one
the credits name him as "Enki"
the mysterious fellow in the beginning of XV-1
Gods=Custodians
inb4 all the Gods were affected by the curse and killed when Enki went full sparta on their asses all according to keikaku but of course Shem-Ha or more importantly her bracelet survived thanks to the coffin and so Enki in the afterlife is going "FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF-"
maybe shem ha wont bring the other gods. if one betrayed her before whose to stop the others from doing the same because she's been gone for so long
of course she will. its on the logo XD
Bikki's way of thinking to reach and connect + Gungnir phylosophical armament status + curse free = God-Killer
plus curse free too
also i think Bikki is still the only one who can use God-Killer because of her unique way of thinking about reaching and connecting or whatever
dont know if it would apply here but in XDU Kanade tried and failed to use Bikki's Gungnir because after its dainsleif upgrade its now custom made for her.
time for some good old fashion copy/paste alchemy!
she's not gone but probably lost somewhere.
Fine helping beyond the fabric of the universe/reality so bikki's hand can connect wouldn't sound so bad. her soul did disintegrate into sparkles of light after all. she can't reincarnate or be brought back. she is gone in the concept as we know her. all that is left is perhaps fleeting memories and feelings of something that used to be
or pull a G gundam ending and have miku break free with a love confession and then they hold hands and together they do sekiha love love tenkyoken please <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
miku's conscience is probably lost in the fabric of the universe. bikki must reach beyond and grab her hand once again
inb4 fudo was a former god and just walks up to shem-ha and is all "hi long lost relative could u do me a solid and turn me into a god again"
Bikki/Basa>everyone
If G had been written properly he wouldve been portrayed as a proper cowardly snake who, while manipulative, was smart enough to tell u enough of the truth.
No Ver please
For LOVE
Metanoia is awesome yes
Regular g-beat opening is like the hero walking through the desert. That whistling yoh. Ignite g-beat u walking through a dystopian burning ruined desert
Ignite g-beat, BtB and TH are ok to me. Ignite X-edge is meh, Ignite airgetlam is ew. And it hurts cause regular airgetlam is beast
No the unisons dont have wub
Airgetlam Ignite is horrible and gives me a headache
B-but put yo hands up
When topdad and ver get mentioned we always get deja vu
Didnt topdad already get his mention way back so we can leave it at that
I guess i didnt mind him in GX because he lived in G and that left the door open so i was mentally prepared and he died in GX. The door should hav closed and stayed closed then
Im gonna at least expect him to pop up in a flashback with him and Fine studying airgetlam but please no lines from him
He already damaged it in AXZ
Crossarm pose!
Ver is a psycho
Topdad was an ordinary man and was in fact weak who couldnt handle stress and succumbed to it by turning to alcohol and raised his hand against his family and left (probably his best decision at that point cause he was turning abusive).
Basa will probably break free once she realizes she's not crazy and that her asshole grandfather had the crazy vamp mind control her
Watch as no one gets to kill fudou because he commits seppuku
The scariest of the brothers dont forget <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Yes there is. Gen did
Carol was already in there. Nearly gone but there. She was just sorta in "life support" and then "bed rest/therapy" when elf9 started her memory hobby. Once she could get going on her own enough she started moving around that brain. And then millaarc fucked up.
She was in that brain copy/pasting and organizing memories. Just minding her own business when this vampire hoe broke into her head house and pissed her off
It might be like Ryoko/Fine too. Their too merged to simply just split them easily. Gotta find the piece that is miku and go from there maybe
Silhouette of miku in the great cosmic void  she's alive and there just lost in the great cosmicness. Its very big
Use ducktape to fix it <:Ver:336656981144109066>
We gonna hav a happy ending. The bittersweet is gear ending
Not saying fine could come back but they could reconstruct a possible memory leftover
Well shirabe was just a tiiiny bit merged with Fine  enough to repeat things only she would know "u havent changed", "believe in the song in ur heart". Shirabe wasnt even aware of it
Reconstruct a possible Fine from the remains of shirabes memories?
iirc one wild arms game ends with ||the heroes as fugitives after saving the world because one guy is a dick tho the people side with the heroes and know the truth||
We do hav that concept trailer for a possible sequel but thats it
No. Their making a tv series based on the smartphone game
Oh and we had a friendly golem too
||nuuuuuuuuuuuuu not devilman ending. please not devilman ending. my heart can't handle that||
Inb4 they use kadingir to fix chateau or vice versa, daedalus end is actually used to reach the frontier spacestation to link to the moon ruins
We got kadingir remains, chateau and the floating piece of frontier in space, daedalus end and the space expedition to the moon
speaking of which i still need to get the 2nd book dammit
Because ships it
Inb4 bikki befriends shem ha and it willingly sacrifices itself for bikkimiku
Im just expecting for gungnir to be destroyed/erased and then reconstructing through alchemy using the chateau, apple with world lvl phonic and belief and philosophy from the song in bikki's heart
Include the xenoblade chronicles x ost too
Y remove a curse when u can control it to control humanity. He also wants a fancy sword made of godpower and hav his daughter as a perfect sentinel
From s1 to s5 its like 1-3 years
And it hasnt been that long since GX
Yeah their gonna take their time
Chateau is some mystical crazy world destroying castle ands sitting very dangerously on 2 buildings
Dude chris parents were volunteers helping refugees. Of course they obviously dont work alone. They hav help. Sonya is one of them. Chris hates Sonya because she thinks its her fault her parents died. Shit happens and she gets separated and sold
Sonya isnt a retcon. She's an expansion to her backstory
Chris story is kinda done. Only thing left is her graduating
And doesnt kill the monster but befriends it <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
U kno this is the part were playing/knowing XDU helps a lil. AUkanade tried to use bikki's gungnir and failed. Because it was modified with ignite
We'll find out eventually hopefully
Unless he cant manifest anymore?
If there are any left. Enki died after all
Not surprised if the favorite dolls become their new bodies
Lala lumiel are slaves meant to obey and do the annunaki's will. They r less than probably cattle and more like dolls.
This whole mess is cause shem ha wanted Fine's body as a new vessel cause she was hot and Enki told him to fuck off
Put shem ha in a doll
Wait... kiri did say she wanted to cut a bit of shirabes soul to break her will to fight or something in G hmmmmm
Problem solved
Just gotta split the thing and find the piece that is miku through reality and then either igalima or chateau the bitch
And handholding. Seriously lewd handholding
Would it really need to when its a coccoon meant to bid time for the ritual to complete itself
A god in gear just takes one of its infinite lives through reality if u try to kill it
Cause he got the "i win" button. Or so he thought cause bikki hax
And once he has Tiki nothing else mattered to him
Especially SG
Adam doesnt mention anyone besides the main 3 cause their more amusing
Their better off to b used in their studies and thats what they show
They were nothing but incomplete failures below everyone. No way they were going to send them to kill the Gears.
Fudou got to them first perhaps?
They did get "mentioned". Something something about an expedition and daedalus mentioned on a screen in... was it GX or AXZ. Cant remember
And "monsters" made by an "evil" organization obviously cant live in society. Either get hunted or serve the highest bidder
The trio arent a problem when that covers what happened to the illuminaty remains. They obviously did a lot of experiments to accomplish their tech/knowledge. Not surprising they did human experiments too
Inb4 enki had kids and those kids had descendants and married a Fine descendant at some point.
History starts somewhere and the lore and knowledge simply forgotten with those who kno it going extinct. All that was left was a song
They dont need to be named. Just some random priestess
Maria and serena are not just Fine descendants but either descendent from other priestesses (Fine wasnt the only one after all) or Custodians
Plottwist shem ha is the god Fine fell in love with not knowing how jerkish she really is and the custodians were the good guys and went extinct sealing it.
Daenslief was destroyed taking the backlash of the alchemy energy in AXZ
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Until carol came to collect
Free real estate
Like we said chateau is a alchemy world destroying castle. Kinda a bad idea to just blow it up
Dont forget Maria, Kirika and Shirabe
Fine, Chris and Murica
You didnt. It was a trail of thought that came to mind. That is all
Only the main 3 would matter because "perfect body". Tho plothole as to WHY SG wouldnt giv NR such a thing after learning how to do so. Unless the perfect body thing is just that hard to make
Nice art
Durandal/Daenslief combination if only <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
AI DESU YO
He doesnt want her to hav friends and become self aware/independant
Strong enough he scared millaarc
He's an asshole who doesnt like the idea his perfect sentinel has feelings
Ver is dead and nephilim feasted on his corpse <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Im surprised durdabla survived but then i also remember that gears and faust robes make their armor/weapons from phonic, or memory burning or some other thing
well the chateau is a floating castle that could fly anywhere and carol and her dolls could warp there. unless it was just camoflauged and was simply in the same place
Just assuming. Unless there are more detailed npcs in other shots that cant remember. We know soccer boy and prez girl went to the concert and died. Both were "amazing people with great futures blahblah". Quick! Find all the suspicious looking npcs.
Conspiracy dun duuun
Those 2 npcs next to bikki are far to detailed. Clearly they must be the popular soccer boy and prez daughter mentioned in keywords.
No no. He survives the stab and after a lil emtional talk or something and headpats pushes her to the side and goes to confront fudo
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Or make it a reverse from s1 final. Basa strikes at bikki and bikki hugs her or maria gets stabbed and maria hugs her
Repeating the scene from gears1. Gen blocks a move from basa meant for bikki. This time he takes the stab tho and just smiles at her and pats her head
Episode 1 was just normal gear building to its ending of showing the annunaki corpse. The minute we see the corpse that meant "the time has come the beginning of the end"
Carol so much sass collecting that rent
The only "madoka" thing we gonna get is bikki pulling miku back to reality and unlike some people she will do it right
Nothing but the most perfect handholding technique for our bikkimiku of course
Genjuro beats his ass and yatsu cuts his political power in the shadows. Of course fudo may or may not escape but still that b great
Named her tsubasa so she wouldnt b a number, went so far to keep her old room "clean", forced her out of the house so she wouldnt become a puppet and follow her dream to sing, possibly blackmailed the world governments to hand over maria so they could hang out together, finally reconnected with her if only a lil bit and they seemed to be doing better. He deserves to also put the old man in his place
I want yatsuhiro to get in the action too. Help take out all of fudous political power from the shadows
And then love love tenkyoken please
Heck id expect gungnir being erased and they use alchemy to reconstruct it by collecting loads of energy/phonic/divine power and harnessing the concept of gungnir with bikki being its source/center because "song in her heart"
Love love tenkyoken please
And that's a best case for it
At most they succeed in getting her conscious back while the thing is severly damaged and she fights alongside bikki for some super move only to loose it from the force
She will loose it because she must
And in XDU one of his AUselves is crazy for scifi and likes tech stuff. Kazanari family secret techniques is be obsessed with something to unlock your hidden potential
Yeah he only started training after ZWconcert iirc
Yatsu called Gen the scariest of his brothers <:Ver:336656981144109066>
And discipline
Action-movies and samurai tales, eating and sleeping
Id b amused if Gen of all people somehow ascends to godhood because getter robo callout <:Ver:336656981144109066>
No one is gonna die except maybe gen in the worst case and obviously fudo and NR... unless by some miracle all or some of NR does get a happy end
And we know chris is graduating. Expecting graduation epilogue unless they put it in an OVA
Kaneko already promised a happy ending. At most a lil bittersweet. Probably just the fact its the end of the show.
Credits would be happy reunions and chris graduation!
Its gear so just give it 1-3 months top
Well the ending in S1 was "sadder" because we and miku assumed she died. This one she would not be. Maybe everyone else might b a bit down or angsty but miku walks around calm/happy. Sees the shooting stars but doesnt need to make a wish because she believes in bikki. Bikki is her sun while she is bikki's sunshine and she will always make it home. You could change the lines to miku smiling with her hand raised to the stars saying "you're late" in a playful scolding manner and then hear bikki's laugh while saying "im home".
They rescue miku but bikki is the one who gets lost through space/time/reality. The government mark her as dead but her friends, especially miku, hold hope because with a smile on her face she had promised to come home to her sunshine no matter what. Time skips with monologue life goes on as normal, miku goes to their special place where they went to see the shooting stars. She smiles and raises her hand to the sky and says "welcome home" as a hand grasps her own and says "im home". The end.
"The End" <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Could also be Fine
also that with each person bikki connects with she became stronger
that event also focused on bikki not liking using her gungnir to kill/hurt people and the "kanade" told her that "my gungnir was mean to kill noise but your gungnir is different. its meant to connect with others"
and we could totally get a kanade a la XDU sun event. if they tap into the "song in bikki's heart" she could talk to her like what happened in XDU
more likely to use the memory machine on shirabe and do something similar to what they did with the maria talking to ver thing. just hav shirabe talk to a figment of Fine made by her own subconscious
thats just a theory
Evil mastermind? Give it to one of aoi's other characters perhaps then
Oh then yes. Just go dl the cd. All b-sides are always in their respective character cd.
Its not in the show yet though if thats what u mean
Praise millhi <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
<:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Time to ultra instinct while listening to the song to find the secret melody
Topdad is just a broken coward. A poorly written broken coward with a terrible written end arc that didnt get a proper "conclusion" or a proper dealing with the consequenses until XV.
Apparently one in Wild Arms 5
Let's see tvtropes... we got some character from Battle Angel Alita, black lagoon, epyon Gundam, Signum in nanoha, obviously ivy from SC and a weapon in castlevania
And berserking
Besides her Sailor Moon/V motif too
Nobel Gundam has a beam whip and does the gymnastic motif thing too
Mjolnir is in XDU but we never see what it looked like and it gets destroyed anyways.
no but play the roll of embassador or appeasing a god to not anger it while he plans to kill and steal its power
inb4 he minds control basa to strike at bikki to "appease" shem-ha for her insubordination
i think so? maybe?
oh and of course the squad i think surprised chris had other friends and just happy for her
chris going to hang out with her other friends. falls asleep gets a call from the squad and they answer the phone for her and let them know how chris is doing
its a minor story
its been forever since i looked up the lyrics so i wouldnt remember anyways
Basa fights DMJii as they show her the true power of teamwork
ok regarding chris friends they do have names. wiki has them as Komichi (ayano komichi), Yuki (godai yuki) and Otome (kaburagi otome) not sure how accurate that is
but you know she's kinda freaking out right now so gotta wait till she gets her mind into GEAR <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
so the god-killer isnt really needed outside of letting bikki's hand connect to where she wants it to
and became his friend
she didn't destroy/kill the pharaohs curse because the mask wasnt destroyed and she didn't put it to sleep because its impossible to reawaken the curse. she simply stopped it at its source and helped free the pharaoh
funny thing is that bikki doesnt really need to "kill god" because 3.5
the recipe was also in the chip
Ver did
but doubtful maybe. bikki's case was pure raw godpower. miku is possesed by an actual god with a relic
just shove some anti-linker into her <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
but it tainted the pendants after one use or something so they required cleaning afterwards. problem got fixed when elf9 got the philosopher stone stuff from SG. hence why bikki froze up during the adam final fight. her pendant was still tainted
it was a counter to the philosopher stones effects nullifying ignite
only gungnir and bikki being the only one to tap into it
Yeah the 1st xdu album has been around since forever
It will but its like maybe 1-2 songs shirt from having another album iirc
Youd hav better luck praying to get a prequel movie because then youd get a fancy kanade henshin and then some
Maria is singing the world is fill with light, has dmjii with her, suddenly serena and mammu r also there smiling and supporting her. An echo of a voice of Ver "See maria it is ai desu yo"
But chances are he'd show up in the bit with the apple song. Maria has dmjii with her and then serena and mammu also join in. Unfortunately ver also shows up to remind us all it is ai desu yo
No
Oh and probably hav cag, prelati and sg saying some lines too during the bit when the people she connected with pop up
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No idea
Sees a silhouette of a miku waiting for her. Bikki stops doubting and Kanade looks at her and gives that big smile. The world is engulfed in light. "dont give up on living" another voice also joins "never stop believing in the song in ur heart"
Starts giving bikki the pep talk "my gungnir was meant to kill noise but urs is different. Urs is meant to connect with others isnt it?" Slowly maybe the scenario changes and one by one the people she has met appear "with every person you connect u become stronger and thosr bonds can never be broken easily"
That gets channeled to bikki and gets mindspaced. She has her doubts and fears, fibding herself in the destroyed ZWconcert and suddenly a voice and a silhouette  "are the bonds you made by holding hands so weak that they would break so easily?" Behold boss kanade with smile on face
I just really want that talk scenario from the sun event but maybe on a bigger scale? Let's see.... like i said before Gungnir gets destroyed/erased. They try to use alchemy to reconstruct it using Apple to unite the world to gather world phonic gain into the Chateau and sacrifice it to also get the divine cutting power, from that light the users see their loved ones standing with them and singing with them too. Carol/elf even get to see their dad working alongside them.
I said simon/kamina. Not yoko/kamina. My poor heart <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>  but maybe that could happen too
We get something like the simon/kamina gurren lagann dreamworld scenario
I think its ok(?) as long as their not blood related. If they were half siblings or cousins yeah theres a cause for concern.
Nah he'd be all "ur my grandaughters wife that makes u my daughter in law. U can stay with us forever as u like"
Too many ways for kanade cameo. Flaming bird silhouette behind basa when she kicks fudous ass with a new attack, bikki or maria or someone saying something that reminds basa of kanade and u see kanade behind said person, gungnir gets destroyed so they reconstruct it by channeling the song in bikki's heart and u get a sorta similar scenario from XDU
that or when carol escapes daudalus end
if they still insisted on spoilering/showing an epic moment in the episode
they shouldve put the scenario when the others were helping bikki punch the godbaby and cut it when she successfully smashes it instead of that scene
and hopefully the only reason kanade didnt get a voice line in the series is that they want it to be an epic moment
unless circumstances were better when she signed up for the XDU stuff
you could put Fine higher too since its her actions that cause the world to get fucked up [well as far as we know]
tbf we dont know how many people fine has killed throughout all her lifetimes
well chris does blame herself for it
no about 12-13k died in the concert but like 3-4k were killed by noise
and since its Fudo mediocracy is not an option.
its possible that Fudo couldve simply told them to get noticed as much as possible and to brainwash basa and well the concert was a 2 birds 1 stone thing
well Millaarcs bio does say she doesn't give a damn about anyone besides vanessa and elsa
SYYYYYMPHOOOGEAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!!! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
that scream is high tier scream
she knew about the locks. didnt expect it was possible to just remove all of them in one go like xdrive
remember the crazy numbered locks
well "shitty" would be the method on how to activate them. they can hurt people and gives u a super powered armor that can fight/surpass regular weaponry by accessing a small fragment of an extinct/destroyed relic by using an alternate energy source. the shitty part is the need to have someone being compatible and having enough personal phonic to work it
but of course couldn't really experiment on her much like she wanted to. then again once she figured out the whole fusion thing she lost interest. i do wonder if she would've still done the fusion if she had had time to find out about the nasty side effects tho <:Ver:336656981144109066>
only other person that ever gave her that "excitement" was bikki
actually i think she could in theory be disappointed in loosing kanade. basa, chris and serena are prodigies so their expected to give good results no matter what. maria, kiri and shirabe were just low tier. kanade on the other hand was the outlier that gave apeshit impossible results despite her low compatibility and low phonic rate. she also may have had the unethical experiments in FIS but with Kanade she had a willing participant so she got away with doing unethical experiments on her because kanade said she could
truthfully Fine didn't care if kanade, basa or both died or lived in the ZWConcert. all that mattered was causing a scene to steal nehushtan. one or both dying was just a bonus tho she would loose a valuable test subject
she wants to destroy the moon to restore the universal language/mutual understanding to unify humanity and is taking extreme measures to do so because humanity didn't come together and fucked itself over and had lost her trust in them. yeah she still wants to confess her love and fuck god even after being betrayed/cast aside
she wont hesitate to kill but she is also practical, ends justify the means, she hates the world and wants to rule it buts that's because she had seen so much shit in her lifetimes that she believes she has to take full extreme measures to handle it all and that humanity needs to be ruled because they have fucked up horrible for ages that they cant be trusted to handle themselves
Fine i guess would be a mix of SG and Millaarc morally wise
oh and about OG noise yeah they were just design to kill only humans. if their none they will literally just walk around randomly and do nothing until they self-destruct/turn to dust
inb4 lydian anthem is used in XV to save the day again
ok ok i gotta stop replaying that scream. im getting to dang hyped in my seat here... ok maybe one more
and i cant stop
rewatching those last seconds on replay now
i mean it doesn't have to be this scene but just a yelling fight bikki face in general
im surprised we dont have a screaming fighting bikki emote for such occasions
Noise r just preprogrammed bots
Ver in G-GX was just continuing a plot thread and finishing it because they left it open in G. Him in AXZ shouldn't hav happened
Akira can at least be the story of a formely good man fucking up life choices and that becoming a better person takes time and effort
Topdad is better
Yeah apoarently everyone forgot how they disliked the autoscorers because they were used poorly in GX. Look at them having some amazing screentime now in XV
Him - calls out ppl for discussing/arguing the out of chatacter moral compass of a fictional character
Also him - complains about plot choices/decisions in show and what characters do in said show because it wasnt how he wanted it
Cag actively tried to kill the gears and civilians. So fighting/killing her was the only option. Prelati was actively avoiding fighting and the gears went full killmode on her so of course she fought back in self defense/preservation
Stealing the show
Linker_k is dangerous, ver perfect linker has no ill effects, elf9 linker apparently could b dangerous on overdose(?)
Millaarc passed her kill count
She killed like 70k people
Saint germain
And she says their her other incarnations and descendants
There was that one scene that showed Fine with a bunch of hystorical figures
Fine probably
And in gear big theme is trying to talk to people
And explaining the difference in the 2 fights
Thats what im trying to say
Yeah yeah 2 in s1, 1 in g, 1 gx and 1 xv
No wait im counting wrong. Its 5 in the show
Well we've only seen 4 basa concerts in show. Obviously she has more off screen
SG kept track of the number of people she killed/caused the death of
In XV millaarc killed 70k+ in the concert attack
Oh in S1 Fine "caused the death" 12k something
Crossed through because gjallarhorn <:Ver:336656981144109066>
People that do know, even if they dont sign an NDA also probably keep quiet/not broadcast it because "its suppose to be government classified so u could get arrested for talking about it". And if you do try to post stuff fujitaka will just edit u like he edited wikipedia <:Ver:336656981144109066>
At least in s1 they showed/mentioned ppl signing an NDA in the early episodes iirc. The school does know about bikki after the S1 final and everytime she ran off afterwards, even if she doesnt explicitely say it because "classified"  everyone is all "there goes bikki again. Must be off to fight noise again. Poor girl cant catch a break. Good luck" and just supporting her, especially the main squad
Their not going to do time travel
Inb4 topdad gives us a cute flashback memory of bikki and miku when they were little and either had a silly fight or something
Oh i got another one. Anyone ever saw the ending to sailor moon star (S5)? Inb4 bikki flies towards miku and grabs her hand <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
praise be to our great lord(s) who have blessed us with such a wonder <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
listening to rikka ryoukan. hype intensifies
We'll probably get her bday in shinais
Id expect a ttgl end for him maybe?
Shhh let them have their moment
Inb4 fudo was never japanese to begin with but simply ended up in japan and the "great nation" took him in and was so greatful he just became so obssesed to show his gratitude he changed his name and everything <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
And not all jp gods look "human". Some look dang demonic
Something something a jp god or something
Dont know if it was a fanpic or not but i seem to recall a pic showcasing the "insides/details" of vanessa's body. And yeah full robot with a human brain. Pretty Kikaider looking actually
Other possibility is vanessa survived and just placed millaarcs limbs close to her so her possible regen can reintegrate them
Millarc could maybe b alive assuming she has some amazing regen. Vanessa cant die until she achives a proper super robot death
Go read it tho
Ill never get my giant super robot Fine combination <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and he didnt die on the moon. he died in frontier
when it hits the kusanagi in orochi's tail the tip of amenohabakiri breaks apparently.
oh wait it says the tip broke off
the irony and poetic justice of the broken and shattered amenohabakiri breaking the murakumo/kusanagi
ame no habakiri in the legend [or at least this one as their are apparently many] was used by Susanoo to cut/kill the snake Orochi. its skin so tough that it breaks the sword. eventually when susanoo cuts the tail of orochi he hears a loud clang sound and when he looks inside he finds the murakumo. he then after some time presents it to amaterasu as a gift of forgiveness for his transgressions and she accepts it. it will eventually be renamed as the kusanagi and one of the 3 japanese imperial regalia
and basa and yatsu finally coming to terms back in GX was also a sorta wish/closure for Nana
but pretty much the relation between basa and yatsu since GX takes inspiration from Nana's relation with her own dad
thanks for the clarification
iirc he didnt like the idea of her singing something else instead of carrying out the family business of singing enka. he passed away before she pretty much got her big debut or something
nana's father died before her big break
kazanari family secret, crazy stretch skills
millaarc watching elza getting lazerd in the chest karma for making basa watch as she jabbed her hand into that other girl
i just want vanessa to live because as a massive super robot reference she must die a super robot death
carol fixes her faust robe problem
either all 3 died anticlimactically because thats how they were suppose to die or at least 1-2 of them survive [probably hopefully vanessa please] for later and they take their revenge on Fudo
btw whats this about some interview saying that topdad hit bikki's mom before the whole ZWconcert disaster? someone in one of the reddit threads was explaining why  people reacting differently to topdad and NR and mentioned that? last i remember keywords say he "raised his hand" against his family after the ZWconcert disaster
both help bikki out in mindspace but she's getting a massive beating. at the deepest darkest despair bikki finds herself in the ZW destroyed Concert hall and gets a peptalk from Kanade who cheers her on and gives bikki the boost she needs. goes back to help maria and kanade and all of them get the sungears and defeat the seed of malice
gears however suffer fatigue everytime they mind jump. the only one not affected is kanade because they figure out that gungnir is important to bikki. kanade also goes and gets black gungnir from her world and gives it to maria
sequel to the recent XD-Quest story. the new villain had given bikki a "present" called the seed of malice that was messing with her head and trying to turn her berserk. bikki was pretty much trapped in her own head fighting copies of all the people she has faced. the gears use elf9 helmet thing to minddive into bikkis mind to help her
note to people - save your account codes so you dont loose your files
sun event is toptier just because kanade ghost
wait which miku gear event? the edgebikki one or the recent xd-quest story?
hey sun event
monster/relic/alchemy shenanigan happens. gears alter their gears into respective costume gears to deal with the problem
and it was the beginning of many events not having stories with them
well the event went up. the event story was pulled. but yes that story was horribly bad.
its a shame it was so horribly bad. the wedding gears are cute
the kanade/basa bath memoria story. cute/lewd pic. turns out the story is sad and depressing
i find it amusing that he has it but hey its anime. only in anime can you see a bunch of random nutjobs carrying sacred national treasures and swinging them around like a stick
he took her father she takes his sword. a life for a life
because high cost and all high cost, except the event shop welfares, are all super power monsters
oh god that chris event. no idea what they were saying but even i wanted to cry
figures out that even if the gungnir in her chest is gone kanade is still there
bikki goes to thank kanade for her peptalk but kanade tells her she has no idea what she's talking about. bikki left wondering if AUKanade didnt talk to her then who was the other Kanade that helped her
#stopbullyinthemoon
so go watch gunbuster/diebuster is worth it <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939>
well if it makes you feel better META the inazuma kick and all its variations from gunbuster/diebuster is a homage to Kamen Rider but above all else Vanesa's dropkick is a homage/reference to the gunbuster/diebuster's variation because aaaall the mecha references
Fine's original theory was correct. she had simply seen too much and had given up from it all
well phonic gain/song was suppose to be an alternative/replacement to the universal language/mutual understanding iirc. alchemy is also the other alternative. so their like multiple backdoors to the same thing and if their generating power from what their doing then their achieving what their meant to do and then some
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/this-week-in-anime/2019-09-03/.150663
Oh right she didnt give them all the info. Just enough to clean. The change happens in Last Ignition. Guess Fool Stone gets fully removed. Too much idiocy contained within it to ever truely harness <:Ver:336656981144109066>
I remember elf9 thanking her for the help
SG gave them the info on philo stone at least. Elf9 showed it on her tablet
Fool Stone is just the opposite of the philo stone but it also had some weird side-effects because it causes some weird taint/backfire. Its not until elf9 gets the philo stone from SG that she works out the kinks iirc.
*listens to Basa's new B-side. supposedly may be dedicated to her father. don't even know/understand the lyrics but still cry a lot while listening anyways*

U mean shirabe's grandad
Well there is bikki's nameless mom and grandma. Basa's mom got mentioned off handedly
Welp, saw the basa bside lyrics further up. Knife through the heart. Its ok. Its not like i needed it or anything <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>  <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

Wait... scorpion black knight.... there was a black scorpion walking over obviously airgetlams arm in the desert...
I think basa was a ho-oh/phoenix, dmjii was a lion and a goat but their kinda joined so maybe a chimera, chris i heard might b a griffon, bikki either just a callback to her berserk days, something like nephilim aand... some other mythological giant monster thing i cant remember the name of, maria a scorpion black knight or something
Didnt someone make a pin of all the comics. Well ima assume it doesnt hav the XV ones yet for spoiler reasons
Oh its iyashikei. Ok now it pops up
^
Funny i look up ishiyakei but i get ishiyaki and i get a bunch of jp table grill/stoves
*looks up ishiyakie because first time i hear the term* hmm assume those are the ppl sitting down and having good food shows?
SoL is good stuff when u just want something chill and when done right
Shirobako is top tier
Plottwist is actually Carol
Obviously either Gen or Ogawa using the measure tape like a whip/rope
Hmm probably shem-ha escapes to the moon in the middle of the chaos. Gotta deal with that  nasty moon. Meanwhile squad trains while they wait for their eventual moon transport
Well sacrifices had to be made for the lovely transformation sequences
Because better to deal with the rocket now and not later
Didnt shem-ha look at the computers in the estate. Might as well notice "ah this strange armor is called SSJ and does this and that"
Humanity was unified without the curse. Enough for Fine to bring everyone together and build the tower. Clearly Enki put the curse to stop shem-ha with the side-effect of dividing humanity
Just hav bikki or someone ask them if a monster and human are so different or that humans and monsters are the same or something
Something about a "a person whose been a villain for millennia cant play hero"
Fine accepted she did a bunch of shit and was wrong and knew full well that her coming back would be a problem
Fine was a broken person with reason, FIS were also broken with reason, Ver is psycho, carol is broken with reason, Alch trio really wanted to save the world by ends justify the means, Adam is a megalomaniac, NR are broken with reason
If basa dad lived her b-song would loose all meaning
Carol was just broken. NR were broken
Adam gets "redeemed" by the fact he was right about sonething horrible coming and would need one hell of a power to stop it. Doesnt change the fact he wanted to rule the world and still hated humans because he was jelly. Ver yes invented perfect linker and "saved the world" but its his fault it happened and tried to drop the moon. He was a psychopath narcissist with an ego or whatever u wanna call it.
Cause mecha family! <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
So getter robo is kinda mazingers cousin
Well ken ishikawa made getter robo but he passed away. He worked in dynamic pro and was friends with nagai. So when ken passed nagai got getter too
He's anime's dirty uncle because he pioneer so much echi
I though go nagai owned dynamic pro <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
And millaarc carried it out because that way the other 2 dont
She comes up with the plans
Elsa is the strategist
Even people killed by her subordinates
SG counts everybody
SG never once denies her actions and even counts the people who die in the crossfire
SG death count is her total in all her lifetime. Millaarc rivaled that in a single night
Nah it would work. Bikki Ignite-XD in GX just fine and that had a possible risk of berserk, a timer [hah] and sadly never/seen heard of again. So Amalgam-XD would be easy and no drawbacks
Also well Vanessa didnt hav much of a choice joining the BI. I mean her parents were already part of it and dragged her into it to. Probably also uses blood cause she edgy and so Elsa and Millaarc aren't lonely. More family bonding by sharing the same eating habits
Smug-ha instead of Shem-ha
Inb4 Carol just shoots it with her castle <:Ver:336656981144109066>
What took Fine 10 years or something Shem-Ha did it in minutes <:Ver:336656981144109066>
No meta - just a regular scene just there for dramatic purpose
A little meta - the scene has some thematic meaning since G had a thing about history repeating itself. NephvsAirgetlam and once again Neph was going to take it with it.
More meta - Revenge. The Neph is a sentient relic and recognizes the Airgetlam as the thing that beat it before and intended to kill it at least.
Bigger meta - Assuming IF it ends up being true. The Nephilim and its brethren were monsters made by Shem-Ha. When Enki turned against Shem-Ha they or this specific Neph fought Enki. If Airgetlam is in fact Enki's arm then this Nephilim could recognize it and may also be followong a bit of its old programming as well as revenge. Thus it has fought and lost 3 times to the same person/thing as well as his descendants Serena and Maria.
But yeah G felt like an "end" at the time but now that we're having all this big picture/story maybe that scene of Nephilim grabbing/trying to kill Maria might have more meaning now if it isn't a coincidence. At least it would be interesting if that were the case.
But GX had a bigger door than G. G felt like an actual end. If GX did become the last season then that wouldve been a horrible end. Besides wasnt there some interview that Kaneko(?) said he planned to end in GX but changed his mind hence why he left the very obvious open plot threads. Then once they got the greenlit not only did they plan for 1 but 2 seasons. i mean yeah AXZ and XV were work in progress/not storyboarded fully but still.
Dont forget that Nephilim is a big fusion and the strongest of the Nephil. monsters made to kill and eat each other until only the strongest remained and that last one is named Nephilim iirc.
Yeah its what I meant. Had a big story idea plan but cut/focused on specific stuff to tell that seasons story so that if they didnt make a next season it wouldnt really need it (S1 and then G but more G cause S1 still had the Fine problem leftover). Also except GX onward cause planned to end it then but changed their mind so it tells you it has a bunch of loose threads and already planned to continue.
I mean G was obviously written without all this stuff in mind. Stand alone end. Could also simply be Nephilim recognizing it as the thing that beat it before [Serena] but if the Yggdrasil and Nephilim "sharing similarities" isnt a coincidence and Nephilim might actually be related to Shem-ha as one of its golem/dolls/monsters and if Airgetlam is Enki's arm then that scene sure has a lot of meaning now. That be interesting. In fact make it be 3 times it got beat by the same thing. First by Enki then Serena and lastly Maria with a full squad cause Airgetlam was just tired of its shit.
But yes lets talk Yggdrasil. That tower has freaking eyes and its color scheme is very oddly remiscent of Nephilim. Nephilim was a sentient relic monster and its heart makes a dang good reactor to power stuff. Maybe it was just how they wrote it in G for story/plot puposes but Nephilim sure loved to specifically try and kill Maria/Airgetlam
and i shall gladly joke about the possibility that since Vanessa is now a "complete" powerful robot and more mecha references then im just imagining more Boob missile variations like in the Mazinger Angels spin-off.
Also more Maria scolding Basa yes and Bikki Leg day
oh and poor miku too. Please give G Gundam ending. Let Bikki express her LOVE with her song and help Miku break free and fly out naked into Bikki's arms!!
Also Airgetlam backstory? AIRGETLAM BACKSTORY?!! please give story. Pretty please.
https://symphogear-xv.com/next/next11_majimenipoemaniki/09@2x.jpg
ok got off my lazy bum and looked at the preview images. Well Millaarc's outfit in her image is fairly Morrigan-ish but with more skin and less bodysuit. in fact I think she shows more skin than Morrigan? https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/darkstalkers/images/6/63/Darkstalkers_Resurrection_Morrigan.png/revision/latest?cb=20121122175731
Or inb4 chris sings lasting song
BikkiChris duet please. Proof of the progress of their friendship <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>  !!!
Mmmm GGG. Good stuff
Vanessa at least can't die until she pulls a proper Super Robot death. Either be horribly torn up while standing like a boss or tear her own core out and use it like a bomb. I can be flexible.
the bracelet was always active and simply needed a new host to hijack. regular relics that aren't active have always been shown grey/fossilized when inactive and disused. shem-ha bracelet was always a nice shiny pretty gold kept perfectly safe in its little coffin prison. probably had some good air conditioning and a humidifier system and whatever else that kept it nice and comfy.
so the bigger question is... are gear users better than the energizer bunny
thought that was a big point since Fine was the one who discovered the "alternate" energy/substitute. always assumed that with enough phonic it simply booted up the main system of a complete relic so it could just do stuff on its own like its suppose to. fragments are to broken to do anything on their own so the user, through the gear system, sorta becomes like an external battery for them.
The implication from that one XDU side-story that Carol got good at singing with karaoke because she thought it was a training tool and didnt like the fact elf9 got a higher score than her the first time. Insists to bring the autoscorers next time to train as well
Because she can and she did
Comes back to life with her Gungnir because it desolved with her
Add bang voice clip
In fact no. Just have her summon one singular ordinary bow, about to shoot one single arrow and a giant gate symbol thing pops up and when she shoots the single arrow a million of them pop up instead
Chris summons Gate of Babylon for amalgam
Slap some ducktape on the chateau. Good as new. Ignore the sputtering and explosive sounds in the back
Im just waiting for Carol to fix the chateua and just go up and pick everyone up from the moon. Just "hey wanna ride?"
The Gears combine to make Mecha Fine!
Gungnir slays gods/divine, shul shagana/igalima reap the flesh/soul, ichaival can shoot infinite arrows or something, AnH idk slash the heavens? We had some convo in sfwart about its real name/meaning and cant remember. Aaand Airgetlam... eh just an arm of a former god i guess
Something something the apple floated to the sky. The apple fell to the ground. The stars were born. The songs were born. The lulu amel smiled for eternity. The stars kissed. The songs slept. Where will they call home? Where will they call home? The apple fell to the ground. The apple floated in the sky.
that emote makes me try to smack at the screen dammit
and punch harder
then just amalgam x-drive
so "override program detected please identify urself?" kinda situation maybe?
as for airgetlam... well its an arm of a former "god" and Maria did have airgetlam around her neck back in G
i mean Maria sang Apple and united the worlds phonic gain/zesshou back in G and we now know that Apple probably isn't ordinary.
perhaps apple is the override program/code
unite the terminal known as humanity
inb4 carol does get what she wants and gets to tear the world apart and then reconstruct it with the chateau to purge shem-ha's influence.
we could get a Nanoha Strikers scenario. Blast her with the chateau [something something cut the divine? its a different definition to gungnirs "kill/destroy the divine"] but probably nah. prbably somehow seal shem-ha in the bracelet again?
either Apple is Shem-Ha's code written as a song by Enki or an override code made and left by Enki. or both.
but im sure apple might have something to do with everything
we know. just having silly fun
BIG GAME! Apple says "the stars kissed. the songs slept" therefore bikki must kiss miku while everyone sings Apple!
Hmmm just realizing that since humanity is apparently some sorta terminal then hearing/seeing kanade and serena's "ghosts" may not have been simple imagination
Inb4 compilations of every gear getting bulli
Lets see series is always 6 discs right? Disc 1 is teamsong/angelic remnant, i expect 1 OST on another, prob elf9/carol songs, dmjii/?, ?/? and ?/?. Fushichio no Flamme cant b one unless its an arrange. Other option is splitting the OST? Still leaves space for stuff tho.
Which means it would show up in the show
We could maybe. Something about needing more songs for the bds?
Just please, if its bikkichris, please give duet song
It makes sense. As bikki is the one who reached to Vanessa before. Chris probably would relate to her and her "goal" i guess... plus hanging out with a crazed maniac
Inb4 some giant ancient coffin does pop up from the antartic <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>
Chris is the missing Gear candidate
Shem-Ha of the mentality that she wants to feel everything and that everyone can understand each other if they become one/hivemind with her. Everyone is connected and she gets to feel all the feels. Win/Win.
If we dont get more Enki/Fine/Shem-Ha backstory then im just gonna fan theory a bit till we get the last 2 eps and stuff. Very weird/anticlimatic that Fine simply "reformed" just from a few words from bikki in S1 (then again was suppose to be 1 season so eh). So what if that maaaybe those words reminder her of a conversation or interaction that she couldve had with Enki long ago during happier times. Probably the reason she fell in love with him (assuming he is the God she loved). Shem-ha could be the snake that got thoughts in Fine's head. "Do this and you can be like us or closer to him" but it was all part to accelerate her plans. So shem-ha came up with everything, gave Fine just enough and Fine unknowingly helped her. That maybe Yggdrasil either might be the Tower of Babylon or maybe ToB was part of the plan to bind Shem-Ha to the Unified Language and probably turn everyone into her. Enki finds out, dukes it out and kills S-H but too late and dies activating the Curse to stop the process unable to reciprocate/explain to Fine. The End.
Fudou gave up. He forfeit the game after only seeing "God". The wimp.
She does (when she can) they just dont listen
Fudo is still alive and Ver was always a twisted a hero who died saving the world (ugh), Adam is a dumbass. What other male villain?
Just expecting Shem-Ha to maybe "reform" by seeing the miracle that the Gears (and maybe the world) does but dies in the process
So teamsong/AR, HY/elf9?, Carol/dmjii? , OST, ?/?, ?/?
Oh right forgot HY
Im wondering if we'll get both aufwachen METANOIA and FC in the show cause Nana album
My poor eyes and brain hurt reading that <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Their not revelant but its a nice easter egg. Nothing to complain about
Keyword explain Ogawa's mad ninja skills back in G and yadah yadah
Ogawabros were mentioned in keywords since G. Youngest popped up in an XDU recently too
Dont have link to the pic but it was posted further up somewhere
Oh and can we talk about the chibi eps12 preview pic. Fine was FINALLY next to Enki. Her wish came true if only in extra art
Movies or OVA/series based on XDU. At least the more relevant events anyways. More shinais
Neph eats the vambrace. The End. <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Inb4 XV Shinais (or the last one maybe) is really AUish all the characters from Gear talking together about the show
Now we gotta wait for when/if XDU lets AUFine know
At least we have the chibi pic of them watching tv
Shem-Ha gets revived and spoilers Fine that she killed Enki. Insert Fine horror face.
We already know its gonna be a happy end
Just have him punch the towers in the background <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Where's megaman exe to help save the web
Aaw nuts
We do hav his AI on the moon tho right
Enki is dead. I dont think he has that gene/language thing like Fine or ShemHa
Chris has her unseen harem
prequel movie but focusing it from Fine's perspective. from the days with Enki to the fall of Babylon and her awaken in Ryoko
i think it was both
the most we could hope/expect is that SONG ran a DNA test on shirabe and had been doing a background check on her ever since G and they find out their related and some family reunion in the epilogue?
there was one XDU story [new year event] FIS squad helped deal with a relic incident at the shrine and more interactions with the priest but cant read japanese and dont remember much of it
kirika is the one that didnt get anything tho
the implication is that the Priest granddaughter and family "died in a car accident" and she probably would've looked/been the same age like shirabe maybe. you also have the shrines name having the same kanji as shirabes. the XV character bio says shirabe was caught in a car accident, suffers from amnesia and was given a name based on the things she had in hand at the time. so pretty straight forward. so that's more than enough
well now that the gears are there she can retreat and focus on the hacking maybe?
visqi probably thinking "this gear train just doesnt stop!"
at least u can save a nice lovely pic of it until you can
Someone should edit that no fear/ one fear meme and put solos name on it
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Total loner with a dark past but a gentle heart and all animals love him/her
Part custodian, part autoscorer, part noise of japanese descent sealed away centuries ago
Too normal. Kazanarari Hino Susanoo Akamatsu Boruto Yami Blade
Well supposedly there are more kazanari children so yeah go full edge
Shem-Ha gonna get some massive amalgamxd godkilling fisting probably
But thats enough mental scarring. Back to XV.
Makes me think of that one alter omegamon digimon from the games. Executioner or something.
Needs more edge tho. Like more scars and internal loathing seeking revenge on those who wrong her probably
Cause they used Kanade's dna to make a clone hybrid thing
||This is your fault btw||
Hmm not sure how to spoiler pics on mobile
Ok glorious edge OC is ready. Could still b more edgy tho
Its the xveps12 preview comic
Should it go here or fancontent?
Do not kno if should mentally scar u all or not
If had some paper would probably giv u an edge OC right now
Do it. Do it.

Also being powered by the combine phonic gain of the universe so they combine their gears into a super robot that looks like Fine
Meanwhile Carolnein is back on earth fixing the chateau so she can make it spaceworthy and then pop up during a climatic moment with her newly formatted space castle.
Then that would be the "get off this planet as quickly as possible before we die" quota which happens when the space train is ambushed and crashlands somewhere
Because everyone knows space train is the only true way to space travel. We'll also make pitstops on other planets and learn valuable life lessons with the power of song. And find that one planet that gets blown up cause we gotta keep an exploding planet quota.
And we'll travel by space train
Pack your bags its time for space travel and visit the annunaki homeworld <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Symphogear XVA - All the Lights in the Sky are Song
"main xdu" stories would get animated as well as the summer event because, even if its filler, it introduces the costume gears and at least 2 costume events also act as "sequels" to the main xdu story and that's gungnir trio and the summer alch events. if other costume events were to get animated they would probably be... christmas, shrine maiden, pirates [pirate fine, pirate fine], sakura blizzard, 1st dragon event, phantom thieves, maybe vampire hunter...
can't forget Sharon event. Oh and the robo shirabe and robo kirika event too. we cant have XDU without the robos
gridman event for giantess bikki, basa, chris and maria <:Ver:336656981144109066>
oh forgot the chris parenst event too. thats a costume event
maybe the genie event too just for a bit of emotional moment for serena
Fine had her eyes opened by MC or at least came to an understanding. Decided to try and believe again. Decided to simply observe instead of fully possese someone. Realizes that people are using her name to do more fuck up things. Chooses to sacrifice her soul for another because even if she wanted to amend she still had countless millenium of fuck ups that simply cant be fixed and people were using her name as an excuse to do more even if she chose not to be around. Erases herself so they dont hav that excuse.
- and is deader than dead
- even tho said character had her soul erased since s2
Im sorry but - doesnt think that all characters need to finish their story arc
- also complains that Fine should b brought back
And we told u to relax. That it was Gear and they would eventually save her probably near or at the end and hav a happy end and that they were simply dramatic for dramatic story purposes
We told u a million times not to believe that cause its gear and of course their gonna save her
And the keywords are "incomplete" till the series ends cause some get continuation because spoilers later on
Dont see why. Keywords were fine
And in S1 Fine at one point said she was more Ryoko for a moment
Standard possesion trope. The souls/person dont get erased but merge in the hivemind of the stronger soul
Yeah its good. Needs a follow up tho
And then Rebellion happens and we shall not speak of that
Madoka points out the world isnt all sunshine and rainbows but it is still worth fighting for.
Meaning its not Fine talking to bikki at the end of S1 but Ryoko's last words
The other thing is they were reaching to the Ryoko part of her. Fine kept sayinh Ryoko was gone. The way she talks in the end says otherwise
The hype was so hight it transcends levels of awesome and AAAAAAA that the brain cant handle because so much hype
Ah the dreaded catatonic hypeness condition. The person ends up in a highly catatonic state due to extreme levels of hypeness from an extremely hype event.
Ur not getting a statue cause she's gonna get dissected chateau style <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
It was always a bit weird that such a giant mirror relic just poofed when u only need a tiny shard to make a gear.
Or XDU content too
Also nothing wrong. Just simply you like/more invested in a specific character more than another that is all
Lack of interaction just proves that bikki has a very dangerous job that takes her everywhere and even if miku gets "special permissions" she's an ordinary person stuck in the sidelines
I dont think they were leaked? Just the scans of the AXZ book since the art for them is in it.
Isnt it the name in the AXZ book?
Tiny considering it fits in the red crystal thing

and elsa's name can also be seen in a screenshot
'Vanessa' is a name that was adopted to refer to a genus of butterfly.
    Vanessa's last name references the Villa Diodati. It served as inspiration for the 1818 gothic horror Frankenstein written by Mary Shelley, who visited the villa with friends to tell stories.
'Elsa' is derived from 'Elizabeth', which means roughly 'I have pledged my oath to God'.
    'Bête' means 'beast' in French. It additionally references the Beast of Gévaudan (French: La Bête du Gévaudan). This beast is a man-eating werewolf that terrorized the former province of Gévaudan (modern-day département of Lozère and part of Haute-Loire), in the Margeride Mountains in south-central France between 1764 and 1767.
the names not that special i guess but the info on the last names is interesting if true
oh they also have name info for vanessa and elsa
'Millaarc' is an anagram of 'Carmilla', the titular character of an Irish gothic novella published in 1872. Carmilla, previously known as 'Mircalla' or 'Millarca', was a vampire who preyed on and made romantic advances towards the female protagonist, Laura.
    'Cranstoun' seems to reference Countess Purgastall Jane Cranstoun, the fiance of Joseph von Hammer-Purgstall, an Austrian orientalist and historian from Styria, the same as Millaarc's origin. Jane Cranstoun was a possible inspiration for Carmilla. 'Cranstoun' is also similar to 'Karnstein', Carmilla's last name.
also from the wiki
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/senkizesshousymphogear/images/d/d3/XVMillaarcNameSpelling.png/revision/latest?cb=20190812235242
yep
surprising the wiki does show a screenshot from the show with her name on a computer monitor
if i remember right only vanessa's brain is organic. the rest of her body is robotic. so yeah easy hijack
not even kiribot knows

SSJ is a mirror that purges evil/illness/etc. Miku wanting to save bikki pumped the purge power to delete relics because she knew bikki had relic cancer and therefore it is evil
^
Inb4 the custodians didnt show up because they were late. The "Shem-Ha escaped alarm" went off but had too much paperwork/preparations to make cause no one updated the protocols and whatnot. "OK WE HERE WHERE THE CRAZY LADY?" "Oh sorry we already dealt with her and she kinda dead" "Wut?"

Hmmm SSJ, besides purging "evil" is also meant to banish demons during rituals iirc
It can also apparently not hurt people when purging if the user decides it that way (miku's ssj light feels like warm sunshine because edgebikki)

Madoka is a far larger multimedia project
But it be best to just end it and simply getting new music cd's during anniversary
We all know capitalism
Thats what oneshot mangas, anthologies, and audio cds are for
Maybe finally give us freaking new figma figures dammit
The series is ending because the story it is telling is ending. We could maybe get spin-offs or more CDs with new songs  plus XDU is still going for the time being. They could make audio dramas too.
Or since humanity is a "terminal/computer" her and serena's data is still in the "system" hence people "seeing ghosts"
Or a cruder variation of telling someone their being a coward
Must avoid for subs and yet 👀💦
Now to wait 2 hours for subs
And even if they do some just dont rate
We get giant fists and oras and whatnot in the show yet the hug is the most ridiculous

Carol used to be human but became homunculus cause kept swapping bodies. Elf9 old body is also a humunculus and a failed broken spare that carol turned into elf9. When they were dying carol merged them and its carols last body their using
NANA WILLS IT
They just needed 1-2 more eps to flesh out a bit the inbetweens and extend the final. That is all
YYT subs 12-13  and releases batch set instead maybe <:ElfneinWeld:586027421296492585>
WE ARE ALL MASTER ALCHEMISTS
Carol MVP
"i know what you're thinking/going to say cause its the same thing i'm thinking/want to say"
that and well shinais maybe
i like what one person said in a reddit post. bikki and miku not explicitly saying it isn't that they deny it but that they both know each other so well and are fully aware that they don't need to say it out loud thus sticking to the theme of people learning to understanding each other beyond the concept of words.
no no its
"i wanna defend the nation!" and "song can't save the world!"
suddenly GOD appears
"yeah f*ck this. its the end of the world and i dont give a sh*t anymore"
meanwhile gears go to fight GOD and use the POWER OF SONG to save the world
shows how weak his resolve to "defend the nation" really was
miku dad showed up back in gear eps1 reading the newspaper but that's about it
and carol's dad
and miku's dad
Fudo was arrested. Basa was visiting yatsu grave

realizing you gotta play Kimi Dake Ni after the epilogue/credits and tadah confession time.
everyone is upset we didn't get subs for the last episode fffffffffff-
dumb question but would it be alright to ask for some mega links of the YTT XV episodes? tried torrenting but just the 1st episode kept fucking up my connection/speed. eps2-4 and 10 i used the mega links and that didn't give me any problems tho.
it is chris
Bad end - they all loose.
End - miku died. Gears sacrifice themselves to stop yygdrasil
Bestest end - miku saved the world is saved
Zoid translated the plot for 3.5 but pretty much the pharaoh's curse slowly kills people and the more people believe the stronger it gets. Curse born from misunderstanding because curse doesnt exist. Just using people's belief/fear through alchemy. Bikki erases/purges the curse by befreinding the pharaoh. Had she killed/destroyed it then the mask should have been destroyed too. But the mask is intact and safe in the museum.
Everyone surprised that bikki "god-killer" could in fact be able to purge and not simply kill when that was hinted at since 3.5 when she didnt kill the pharaoh but purged the curse freeing the pharaoh instead <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Because people got whiney cause someone botted upvotes so now they threatened with downvote
that's curse of balal levels of shenanigans
Yeah i kno 80 is now the big new price point for them. Remembering ancient times when they used to be cheaper
And dont forget the exclusive items
I mean maybe depending on the brand yeah but knowing gear they'd be on the high price scale probably. Still good stuff tho
Pricing... *sees the $80 simple looking figures with almost to no accesories*
Its fine. Some people started by watching a later season by accident.
Miku used to be in track team. She just ran there at the speed of sound <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Well elf9 said they made it on time so yeah pretty likely miku got their by helicopter or heck even a jet. Express wife delivery <:Ver:336656981144109066>

Pretty much that apparently Carol used to work for the Bavarian Illuminati but left. Prelati designed and built the chateau. It was her precious baby and Carol stole it, Prelati is pissed and Carol is a wanted criminal by them. She doesnt remember them cause she burned her memories of them and her time at BI too.
I mean we got more info about carol and alchtrio during the new carol event (still ongoing) and its <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Kirika past for future XDU? This gonna be interesting 👀
Nice <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
Also it could be shirabe and chris thinking of Fine and not just bikki
Dont see how its bad. The data is the remains of them after all. Guess i was right. Mentioned once before that since humanity is a giant terminal that their "data" could still be saved within the system thus letting them still interact as "ghosts"
Because gotta do like a butterfly and metamorphosis properly by housing all that concentrated god power
Ok perfect control debatable because of the mind control. But eventually gets free and still gets more easily punched.
Wow weird sense of deja vu
If they gave it to a doll then shemha wouldve been in perfect control and an easier target for bikki anyways
Some, especially garie, but its mostly cause they use memories for power
wait they opened a new site? *goes to look at it*
Just joking cause she tends to copy/have similar moves to the other gears. She be megaman
That leaves shirabe, maria and chris. Not many good choices for them. Coco for chris cause gatling gun? Velvet for Maria cause copy move? Kanade as Pyrrah for reasons?
Bigger question is who is ruby if bikki is yang
Oh tsubasa also good choice
Chris maybe?
Never liked oc/canon when the canon character already has a canon pair in the canon story and "writers" just break them/dont make them a pair for their own weird drama.
Lol
And blake/yang is pretty much canon iirc
Thats not meaningless either
Vanessa makes faust robe ssj. No one else can
Nonsense. They also existed to mentally scar tsubasa, be decent decoys, make super robot references, make faust robe ssj and piss off carol enough to wake her up and then die bringing the gears back to earth.
besides shouldnt complain about y not duet songs between different characters when we have CTF, Fuugetsu and Hitsuai
they do have a dmjii duet song
no there isnt. not in the game
The cut was the heart and s1 ref like bikki's and it was added later in another episode iirc
Gears get the most sprite changes ingame and characters comment about their new gear looks after every Gear catastrophe <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Or if the SRW game is 2 parts then S1/G/GX in the first and AXZ/XV in the 2nd
Srw 3 part game. 1st game has GearS1/G, 2nd game has GX/AXZ, third game has XV
genius!
oh of course
CoMyCuDa"ma"
and then make a shorthand name for it... CoMyCuDama
disappointed. in this modern age it must be a super long ass title. "Press Conference on My Cute Daughter and Maria who shall obviously become my future daughter in law because they both obviously like each other but are to shy to admit and I will gladly blackmail the world governments because I fully support them wholeheartedly 100%"
and obviously supported BasaMaria since he apparently blackmailed the UN(?) to hand her over or else.
multi copies of CDs too
we all know that he not only kept her old room perfectly "clean" as she left it but that he secretly had a room full of Basa memorabilia at home. every. single. basa. merchandise. all of it.
Only now realizing that CR posted the Bondage, Reentry, Over Brave and Metanoia scenes. rewatching bondage scene and Carol having every intention of saving Miku because she says she already finished analyzing humanity and simply needed to classify any "impurities" as a "god" and purge the shit out of it but lacked enough deus ex machina memories to do so. good times.
EVA ref
71) Make everyone listen to your song
oh Macross in there too
like i said. this is super old and just a random funny i found ages ago
probably Gravion
not anime but still
Megas XLR
New Gaiking too
G Gundam, EVA, Gurren Lagann, GGG, Mazinger, Getter Robo
there is a bit of everything in there really
yeah. not mine. just found it and saved it

ah found it. it is very old and probably outdated with new stuff somewhere. but im sure lots of this applies to Gear
where is that thing... i should have that thing saved somewhere...
and maybe some other letter
along with X and Z
rules of mecha G is the strongest letter
XV= Xtreme Vibes. song name drop. AXZ was something representing the beginning from A to the end Z. GX at the time was suppose to be the end so slapped an X on it or something. G=Gungnir iirc
well curiosity looked at the CR episode again. they subbed the Over Brave song part and the Xtreme Vibes [the one in yggdrasil i think its what its called] not the ending song though
with a mortal wound
or they fought in what was the sahara desert  then he freaking travels to the pacific to Frontier?
where was airgetlam recovered? israel? i know they got it with shul shagana and igalima
yeah its like. shem-ha wouldnt have revived if the moon blows up. but the coffin comes out, Fine defeats the coffin maybe? they get the bracelet and the first dumbss to put it one gets f*cked and instead shem-ha
and she's still being worn by a corpse at the time anyways
something something about Apple helping linking humanity and reviving shem-ha. so maybe destroying the moon wouldnt wake her up but you know the firewall would be gone and if juuust the riiiight things happen instead shem-ha wakey wakey
well if everyone is free from the curse then maybe better compatibility rates afterwards so why care about disposables when she''s making an ion cannon to deal with eveything
plus i think the study of the gears was more Ryoko than Fine. unless Fine was planning to continue the study more freely once the moon was blown up cause no Curse of Balal afterwards and her line about if the curse was gone then the zesshou could possibly be used better or something
super late to conversation and catching up <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>
oh and yeah iirc its a mix of lack of proper gear users and actual compatible relics that they never had more gear users.
yeah. airgetlam was already cracked. it got super charged on phonic gain and the stress of the whole reactivation and fighting eventually breaks it in the end
Vanessa i think freaked out when everything activated too soon or something
So they did the setup, were prepping everything. All systems linked. Maybe use vambrace energy to complete merge and then slap the thing on miku? Vambrace said "eeeh let's skip the wait  come here my pretty" and just absorbed all the things while taking miku because eeeh it was already linked to it all.
Maybe the ssjfr wasn't going to be completed without vambrace activation. Dont Faust Robes need like a lot of energy to make or something?
Shem-ha prepping that dress while in coccoon form cause gotta look damn good when she comes out
Uuh scene with her arm raised. Seem to recall miku screaming in horrid pain with arm raised and then the tendril thing out of her hand/arm and then god coccoon in the sky.
No. They left miku in the room with the vambrace. Cant look at episode right now but point is she still gets it on. Wasnt it surrounded by ssj fragments too to contain it
I mean whole point of bikki and miku is that their curse free. If shem-ha could posses without the vambrace she should've taken either of them immediately. I think she was sealed in the Vambrace and until a curse free idiot puts it on she will still be stuck in it. She also needed to activate Yggdrasil to get the system going too
Blame Apple. They funded it
Didnt Apple revive Shem-Ha's conscious from the depths of nowhere or something and she was stuck in "limbo" afterwards cause of the curse so she was sorta waiting around till a good host came along and put the vambrace
Also if we follow the lil info from the carol event in XDU, carol is a wanted criminal by the illuminati. Probably be busy fighting each other or something
Shhhh let me have my wild arms
Thats either half-way point or near end of a wild arms plot
Shem-ha cant posses anything until Coffin-kun gets defeated and some dumbass puts the bracelet on
The moon gets destroyed, fragments of it crashing around the world, tidal waves, mass destruction, all hell breaks loose. Coffin-kun wakes up because of it all and travels around the globe causing more mayhem and ordinary tech does nothing to it. All the destruction forcing humanity to start somewhat from zero. Soon enough people rebuild and create a  fairly wild west kinda lifestyle. Fine who had died as Ryoko during the chaos reincarnates in this weird era. Insert some new Wild Arms plot <:Ver:336656981144109066>
explains why it had its shield up and it was still running
apparently so. maria was not tripping when she saw serena
ah fair point
at the very least would've expected a bikki/chris duet and a chris/dmjii trio song
But a full tl of the whole story with all the dialogue no i dont think so.
Zoid summarized the story in his blog iirc
Impossible cause 3.5 is canon at least and its XDU exclusive <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Not really. Its bikkimiku. Hell in XDU the 2nd summer event shenanigans is caused by them, especially miku because she couldnt deal with bikki going away for 2 weeks for a mission. So everyone got stuck in a timeloop until she accepted it <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Unless they did come back and it was never shown for shock value. Keywords mentioned they were marked as dead to hide them until the government cleared the whole legal mess and whatnot iirc. So reality they did come back down, tearful reunion, are later told they hav to play dead for a bit because government shenanigans, "sad" goodbye/see you later. That whole visiting the grave was just miku keeping the charade but depressed as f*ck cause misses bikki. Reunite cause everything got cleared out. The end.
Also that moment you finally realize Basa isnt smiling in that manga page cutting Fine. Its her freaking neckcollar covering her face and the tiny "smirk" sticking riiiight above it is blood splash.
In fact i think they changed several bits of dialogue and such in other seasons iirc but cant read moonrunes so cant really tell. The change in S1 end was more obvious tho for obvious reasons.
In XDU they did change the ending in the S1 story with bikki, basa and chris coming back down immediately after blowing the moon fragment and reuniting with everyone. So no grave scene end.

well looks like my local government has decided to install a "curfew" because of the coronavirus thing. everyone to be home from 9pm-5am. stores should close earlier so employees can make the curfew or something like that
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
Or become just as strong/special of course
Online friends are no lesser than "IRL" friends. They just have their pro/cons like everything. "IRL" have the advantage of being close by/easier physical contact. Online while not impossible takes effort. Either way people change and even IRL connections can die out just as easily
Ah the parents traditional "their not real friends if you meet them online"
At best/most you'd make 1 "life long" and/or "that one important close friend" during school years
<@238855496797257729>  I could but i dont have/want an Xbone and my laptop is old shit so it wouldnt be able to play PSO2 <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
It doesnt matter if their online or IRL. The point is whether you connected/made special connections with the people you met no matter where. Those are the real friends that matter
Meanwhile made several friends online during my old PSO days that i considered special. Lost contact with most of them but wouldnt turn them away if we ran into each other online again
Of all the people i knew in school i only keep contact with 1. The funny thing is we knew each other since we were kids but only acquainted. Then she moved to another school, then moved back and then we became bests buds the year before she moved again (the power of anime and games i tell ya). Either way our interactions afterwards were by phone/text and very rarely if ever saw each other. Made plans to go to the same college and did. After graduating back to phone/text/email. Havent talked to her in months because life but if i did that be an instant "hi what crazy shit u up to now" like the dumbasses we always were.
Havent seen/read any yet but couldve sworn i read somewhere that the LN isnt as hyperrapey (it mentions it but doesnt get super sexually creepy or something) and that the manga is the hyperrapey one and the anime bases itself on that and thats a point of division for LN/Manga/Anime reader/viewers
Isnt that also one of the themes of the show? Because "their weak" the stronger parties/organizations ignore them when they know that ordinary people and/or weak adventurers cant and that is not ok because it leads to the bad shit happening that shouldnt have happened in the first place. Vicious cycle repeats
In a situation like that you try to keep calm and observe the situation and see if anything could be possible. If not then you have to wait it out
Wikipedia cause why not - "A straw man (or strawman) is a form of argument and an informal fallacy based on giving the impression of refuting an opponent's argument, while actually refuting an argument that was not presented by that opponent. One who engages in this fallacy is said to be "attacking a straw man". 
The typical straw man argument creates the illusion of having completely refuted or defeated an opponent's proposition through the covert replacement of it with a different proposition (i.e., "stand up a straw man") and the subsequent refutation of that false argument ("knock down a straw man") instead of the opponent's proposition."
You're not considering the fact that terrorists have an agenda to spread more fear and pain. You and the other hostages are just that. Hostages to hold back authorities while they carry out their bigger agenda, which is inflict an even greater pain/fear
Same
Ah yes
Pardon for the example but one example would be one of the 9/11 planejackings. One was intended to hit the white house iirc but was veered offcourse because the passengers and crew worked together to stop the terrorists. They knew they wouldnt make it no matter which way but they chose to stop a greater tragedy from spreading.
You cant save everyone.
Terrorists hurt others to inflict terror and pain. Thats why their called terrorists. Taking down a terrorist to protect people doesnt make you "the same as them"
Morally grey is acknowledging that while one wants to talk things out it doesnt deny the possibility that it wont always work and the need to take a stand when needed
Morally grey is taking a stand when needed
Strength when used incorrectly is violence. Strength when used correctly is true Strength.
Even jesus threw a table iirc
You're lumping legitimate self-defense as "evil"
In a situation like that they dont care about the wellbeing of others. Most cases they will not listen to reason because their insane with the singular purpose to spread pain
Their preprogrammed to kill humans only and not harm natural things if possible. If left alone they could wonder about a forest and do nothing (unless they sense humans then they move in that direction)
More like preprogrammed drones with a hivemind if there are more of them
Nephilim truely best villain
Nah they failed to showcase how bad it was to justify her decision (at most u get a glimpse when Serena died). At least XDU showcases better that she's dealing with some serious political BS in the background among other things
At most u know that she was around during/after the curse of balal and implied she saw the worst of humanity throughtout the aged and lost faith in it so of course she would think "f*ck it all"
My only reaction to that was "what the fuuuuuuu- <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505> ?"

Know the feeling. Perhaps has to do more with whatever your parents say or the way they talk. You know them so long you recognize their specific patterns in the way they "talk". The kind their not supportive or being condensending or being passive aggressive about something. You know the one that makes you go "here we go again"
Dont forget apparently admitting he was hoping he wouldve killed more people <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
And you kinda walked into that one when you started spouting some stuff earlier even if it was sarcasm or some such when the conversation was already heated
No one is upset about "violence is not tge correct path". Everyone agrees with that. Ideally we all would like things to be solved peacefully but when that doesnt work and people are still being brutalized then that's just waiting for it to explode
You know there is so much people can take before all hrll breaks loose. And it did so again
We arent against the "its not ok to destroy business". But this is just one big thing blowing up all at once again
Point is there have been peaceful protests against police brutality for years. Sometimes it worked but most cases it hasnt with many of said cops getting away wuth a slap on the wrist or nothing at all. That has been piling and piling. Now here we have another person being murdered and again recorded and the cop getting away. It blew up with riots and damages and only NOW is tgat cop arrested.
they can easily say he was to high on adrenaline/fight&flight/whatever to think straight or some nonsense.
Go lay down, go take a nice relaxing shower, anything else really
Probably just stop until microsoft gets some of their shit together because woooooo they fucked it up so bad
You also gotta accept that some riots/destruction of property happen not cause it was people protesting but some jackass trying to rile shit up for the laughs and it just makes things worse because tension was already there and people not knowing who to trust
And again peaceful protests have been done, they didnt work, the voices were not heard, justice was not served, etc. The resentment and anger thats been building up blew up yet again. Tragic though not surprising in the least.
Pretty sure attacking a Target/Any Store is a morbid showcasing of "look how fast they respond to arrest someone and look like heroes but they dont hesitate to cover their own asses when they murder someonr even when their caught on tape"
One of the replies. Not sure how legit it would be though

Because for all we know they couldve meant "pandering type yuri that goes nowhere and is just there for otaku bait" or something because it sure is hell of impossible to make an all-female cast without them bonding and gotta twist your eye sockets to call even the smallest friendly smile as "zomg evil yuri blargh never watching this again" <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
The question is what anime did they see that "didnt have yuri"
and according to the responses - on Pride Month on the anniversary of the Pulse Club massacre. So much "winning" ugh <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>

oh wow <:HibikiOhNo:586337444597596202>
People please calm down. Let's remember written text tends to not convey well and can have mix context
The "define understood" one
if it helps a little, you are understood. not 100% perfectly cause that is not possible for people but bits and pieces, here and there. even if its a little bit, the concept of the frustration of not being understood, it is understood. missing context but everyone wants to be understood if only a little. have a hug <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170>
not the Curse of Balal in action but simply humans being ass because they can simply refuse to understand.
that moment you do make a perfect diagram that explains things perfectly, simply and directly yet they STILL don't get it or dismiss you right off and still ask you to explain and you just want to bash your head in because FFFFFFFF-
hugs for everybody <:ZweiHug:672455346949980170> <:Zababies:672238628398956594> <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455> <:HibiMiku:432007202136391690>
iv missed out on those other times when they happen but i catch up on reading when possible. i know the feeling of not being understood or those moments when you can explain clearly and yet the other side just doesn't seem to get it at all. what do they need a diagram? so frustrating and just uuuugh
Not denying that Cocoa
The whole sequence of
- never understood
- define it
- case in point
- you never tried
Is literally just asking to be misunderstood on both sides and could be taken wrongly
to be fair you could see that happening a mile away. not surprising in the slightest <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Lol
language and how you phrase/say things
tone it down please
that was something. yeah
most ordinary people dont
or overthinking too much
It is the government/state/etc fault but also uncaring people for not taking this seriously enough and thinking it was a game/hoax or whatever and just not handeling it accordingly. Now we're stuck in this weird back/forth that should never have happened. Lives arent some toy you can just trade off like nothing. There are ways to deal with the problem and dumbasses just refused to do so because they dont want to and are just "fuck everyone else". Bad mindset
Other option "the madness of it all has reached such a point that im indifferent now"
Sounds like "the illness hasnt affected me or someone i know personally but the lose of income has so i think the illness is less important to me so its outcome to me doesnt matter because it hasnt affected me" or something like that
did anyone tell you how amazing you are? because you are and i think everyone else here just did. let it be known that you are loved and appreciated <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>

So according to the news just now Trump tested positive for Covid.
Oof
And war doesnt give a shit what country you belong to. You want JP or China invade Hawaii to "kick the US out" but JP/China would very likely enslave Hawai people in a war cause your not japanese/chinese/eastern/etc. Careful what you wish for
Puerto Rican here. US treats us like shit. Dont go wanting a civil war no matter how much i hate US thanks
Which is another topic debacle in the "state or territory" thing
Mmm im not very well versed (hate politixs like the plague). Mmm I think it depends? Yeah we have some benefits and dont have to pay or pay less in certain taxes for being a territory. On the other hand we pay more on others and getting shafted in other ways
Yeah if the voting and such was overhauled/amended to include US territories etc people would probably just want to stay as a territory. Really its just people not having/loosing/having less US Citizen rights/etc just for simply living in a territory/here. Although meanwhile Virgin Islands next door you can get  them all if you live there iirc so its like <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344> <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344> <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Yeah dont remind me  <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025> . Its 3 choices. Become a State, keep the status-quo (colony/US Territory) or Independent. Obviously the first 2 are "favorites" cause people have crazy imagination we'll end up with a tyrant government if we go independent and/or too scared to loose their "US citizen perks" among other things. That and our econony is fucked up so people think we wouldnt survive on our own. The "big war" between being state or territory is more about joining the big US and gain all the rights as such and probably be treated as equals but loose our individuality or keep our individuality but keep getting some of the perks but still get treated as shit because as a territory you're pretty much "second class citizen". In the end its always dependent on who leads cause people keep being stupid enough to ALWAYS vote for shitty candidates that they KNOW are corrupt (and have FAILED so many times) out of political loyalty.
Tl;dr politics and stupid people
comrade <:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>!
yep. you too?
when being born on the island yes you are a certified citizen and all that but because we're a territory, not a state, you can't vote here and have lesser rights/can't apply for certain things if you live here. all intents and purposes we're second rate US citizens
can't vote on the island but if you already finished moving somewhere else and are register yeah you can "vote somewhere else". he actually said that once iirc and i can tell you this, despite how shitty we know he is, despite how shitty he's treated us i wouldn't be surprised if people vote for him. we keep picking shitty leaders and i mean just look at the people who are stupid/crazy enough to vote for him anyways <:TsubasaYareYare:407397617451139073>
is it wrong of me to imagine that people would vote for Jo Jorgensen just because of JoJo <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
i know wiki isn't a good source but it has a table of the presidential candidates
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_party_and_independent_candidates_for_the_2020_United_States_presidential_election
looking up it says his VP candidate is someone named... Michelle Tidball
i thought he quit running?
ew wtf <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
i end my 2cents
they suck ass
aaaaand despite our differences we can all agree that politics suck
2cents. blaming green for voting green is not cool and going about using variations of "voting X is a waste. you're just voting for trump" or "2nd round of Trump is acceptable then" is fairly passive/aggressive, insulting and guilt trippy no matter how nice you're trying to put it. especially if someone gives their clear/reasonable reasons as to why (whether because feeling uncomfortable or preferring their green candidate, etc). we all know its a candidates responsibility to win voters over and we can blame the party leaders for putting shitty people as candidates too. I cant vote for the presidency because of where i live. thinking about it id probably vote Dem, "lesser of 2 evils", but that's because i don't know/not informed on other candidate/parties that isn't Dem/Republic. if i was and if a green/independent caught my interest more than Dem/Republic then i'd go for them instead. still though there is no reason to loose ones cool. everyone has a right to vote for whom they believe sticks to their believes most.

yeah wait on passing judgements. my brother was being insufferable when we had to constantly remind him that those are only like 10-15% of votes in X area, etc. <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Holy shit
Final act of 2020 and a "nice" way to start 2021
Fair point
Someone posted that tweet further up actually <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Trump talked. Of course still insists the elections were rigged
<:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
i remember hearing they found a bomb/homemade explosive during the whole debacle but it wasnt clear 100% at the time. guess its fully confirmed now
Yeah we've known/been warned about that trashfest since it was announced
Only saw clips of the anime and read the manga. I like the character interactions and them trying to help GS pretty much learn to be human again. Its the goddamn rape porn that ruins it
<@99695384296701952>  yeah that
Or at least that's what i heard
Another show you can imagine doing that is Terraformers i think? The human insect people one
That was an excellent piece
But yeah there are other thematic problems/showcasing in GS than the goblin threat
Yeah. Its when they get smarter that it becomes a problem but its apparently uncommon
They do small encampments little by little as decoys. They hide easier and then get bigger so they can then target bigger places eventually.
Well the other thing is that most of the common goblin attacks happen in small poor villages or small homes in the outskirts. Small numbers, easy targets. Nobody would care.
At the very least they later explain their not suppose to be so organized. Such a level means some sort of proper strong leader/structure and the propagation is implied to tie in with the possibility of the Demon Lord returning with high rank generals commanding in the shadows by strengthening/helping the stronger goblins to lead their clans and letting them run amok
So yeah the goblins "nonexistent" threat isnt a consistent theme when people know of the horrible shit that can happen if their left unattended but people still insist its not a problem so <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344> <:HibikiWhat:336656482907193344>
Well to be fair they didnt get any advice. It was "oh its a goblins nest of assumed maybe 5-10 goblins even though there is no proper info so it'll be an easy clear" when people have the horrible habit of forgetting they get smarter the larger the group/the longer they live and it wasnt just 5-10.
But yeah people/adventures ignore the mook adult goblins because their "weak" even though the basic civilian cant fight them very well. Several ordinary people vs 1-2 goblins sure. But against 15-20 (and their not idiots) its a disaster
Well the thematic isnt consistent in that. Its the base mook goblin that people say arent dangerous and ignore. Which lets them breed/propogate into full clans and actual strong monsters which end up causing more havock. There also seems to be a corralation of goblin propagation with big evil plot schemes of dark lords returning. Like the coming of a bad omen
And it doesnt have pages worth of rape focus
You know its also a waste to say that eps1 shows why GS is the way he is when they later show his backstory which does a better job anyways
Yeah my understanding is the anime adapts those scenes from the manga which is more explicit in said content than the LN
Are you talking about the 1st or 2nd impeachment? The first yeah he was impeached but he wasnt convicted. Wasnt the 2nd one delayed to feb or something or thrown out the window?
<:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>
I got the story i can tell you
Anyways just cause you like AdultMaria one way doesnt mean you have to like ChildMaria the same. They are technically "different people". I was iffy on ChildMaria because obvious money scheme obvious "lolify the adult and ooh she's actually 22" bullshit but i did end up liking her as a character in her story and she had an emotional moment with ChildSerena. She ended up being a badass. I like her cause she's cool and that's it.
What's your reaction to ChildSerena and AdultSerena? Reminder ChildSerena is 13 but had she grown normally she'd be 20
Just cause you like AdultMaria doesnt mean you're obligated to sexualize/be sexually attracted to  ChildAUMaria. You can find AdultMaria sexy and ChildAUMaria cute
what you don't know is that the dog actually had psychic powers and mind controlled the cop and/or telepathically pulled the trigger. anyways that's what he gets for trying to hurt a good boi

id say the most the mother would have a choice in that situation is whether she will have or not the child. if she chooses to carry the pregnancy then she should have her parental rights revoked. at the very least either her own parents or a relative would have the right to decide. the father should be given the choice to keep/revoke their parental rights and whether they would raise the child themselves or not. if no one wants the kid then he/she ends up in foster care/adoption
Me and one of my bros didnt get anything from either shot but my dad and older brother apparently got a bit of a headache and mom got a lil ill from the 2nd shot. Dad's headache went away quick enough. Mom and older bro took some panadol and that helped. My sisters bf i heard definitely got hit hard with it though. Drink plenty of fluids/gatorade/juice/vitamin c. Staying hydrated helps

ok TikTok seems fine. at least you can access the main webpage unlike the other things lol <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872> so probably people overreacting or influx of people or something else.
so short version is that Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger (and any Facebook related products) are all down because someone fucked up. TikTok might also be down too or at least having issues <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

It was complete incompetence/ negligence. Something something real guns are used for certain scenes, close ups etc for realism i guess(?) but all guns (whether real or rubber) should be treated as loaded and always checked no matter how many people say its not.

If he wants to do whatever with Julie-Su thats on him cause he owns the rights (alobg with a bunch of other characters) iirc (fucking sucks goddammit) but he shouldnt be doing anything with Shade cause she's SEGA iirc
Condolences. We didnt interact but i know she was a good person by the little i seen around.  R.I.P 🙏
Going through somewhat the same right now. My cousin and her youngest child got covid because some jackasses at her job got covid and didnt tell anybody. By extension her husband, her eldest child and her mother (my aunt) are under watch. They gotta wait to get their tests done. Normally my family takes care of my grandmother during the week and my aunt (and their family) takes care of her during the weekends but that now falls to us. Yay more stress.
Also a limit cause of health complications when the pregnancy is practically over or some such
You wanna know how to deal with a knife wielder? Tase them.
Also if you need a "gun for protection" pretty sure a normal person would just get a simple handgun and not need an AK-47, rifles and whatever the fuck fancy else
By human logic everything and anything can be a weapon even if most things have a secondary useful functions BUT guns are just plain simply a weapon to kill.
Oh right background checks for history of violence cant forget that
In an ideal society we wish guns would sieze to exist. Sadly people are fucking stupid. So gotta deal with baby steps. Strict gun regulations, age 21 restriction, mental checks, ban a bunch of guns that arent necessary that an ordinary schmuck doesnt need for "home protection" etc etc etc
Besides a home owner would have their guns secured with no easy access (so people/kids SHOULDNT get to them easily) so youd still be screwed against a surprise gun robber anywayd
its an hotel on water i guess
correction modified sawed off shotgun
wtf close range with a fucking shotgun holy shit
Reminder its not the same gun from the attack. It says this one was recovered from the killers home
We're all vaccinated. So far brother just feels/seems like he has a very annoying cold. Parents very light on symptoms though they just started
Well shit. One of my brothers caught covid. Been showing symptoms friday. He immediately quarantined himself and kept distance but looks like our parents caught it too. They all did the home test and tested positive. Sister and nephew who live elsewhere caught it a couple of weeks back. That leaves myself and eldest brother and possibly/hopefully grandmother <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Jokes on you. Crocodiles would probably be better teachers
well, dad got some more home-tests while he was out and me and my older brother tested negative for covid so that's something at least <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

covid is a bitch <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
update on the covid thing. of course everyone in the family got covid but everyone is on the mend and doing ok with minor coughs. no one dying. it was a much more annoying inconvenient cold. grandmother also caught it. i think she's on day 3. luckily she's ok despite being extra elderly. im on day 6 and going on the mend too. its now just a cough and mucus. first 3 days were shit. only got a minor soar throat but got hit with the bodyaches and heachaes and fever. obviously downed panadols like a nutjob (joking i followed the instructions properly). still felt heated and pained and sweated like a pig. disgusting. forced myself to eat despite lack of apatite. downed so much juice and water. still cannot smell or taste anything. covid sucks balls. do not recommend.
Same. My whole family still has this damn annoying cough that doesnt want to go away

Doesnt help that no one else is talking either to avoid drama or because of NDA and people getting peeved because of Kamiya's standard troll twitter blocking thing... despite being something EVERYONE should know he's been doing for years (even being a kickstarter reward/goal for W101) and yet people are somehow pretending they dont know. This is a mess
Tl;dr From "source who wishes to remain unnamed due to risk". Apparently Taylor was originally offered 15k for 5 sessions. She wanted more. So they recasted and got Hale. Offered Taylor a cameo 1 session for 4k. She still said no.

Hey hey dont forget the one thing in S2. Dont forget
<@139432096023183360> Nuuuuuuu <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
all i know is that they fired the original director because of BS and treated him like shit and then they started to treat the show in general like shit and retconning the heck out of S1 and people just hating everything because they were all pissed
it was just a simple series that ended up having a bigger plot in the background than originally thought
same
true
at the very least u would think they would fire the guy in charge of screwing up the whole deal and then some. or demote them
i take it google didnt help much or at all either then
and it will be worth it
great now i wanna watch YuYuYu all over again and punch something
well ||the crow sorta answers itself later on. you just don't get the full meaning/impact if you don't read NoWaYu.|| so yeah like Gunbuster/Diebuster. stuff from Gunbuster being implied/shown in Diebuster. it sorta explains itself just enough but you don't get the full meaning/impact without watching Gunbuster. what was the other YuYuYu novel? KuMeYu? that one is a side-story to events in YuYuYu but doesn't really affect the story. it has to do with a person in Karin's past before/after she became a hero and with the exception ||of the cameo and color meaning in the final|| can probably be skipped.
Its like watching Gunbuster/Diebuster. Diebuster can hold on its own but watching Gunbuster beforehand just adds more impact and the easter eggs/lore all over.
Technically you dont need to read NoWaYu to watch YuYuYuS2 but reading it does give the massive impact to it. And well YuYuYu is a multimedia franchise so lore everywhere
Oh and just in case YuYuYuS2 first half is the prequel story WaSuYu which was also released as a movie trilogy which will also break you <:Ver:336656981144109066>  . YuYuYuS2 second half is the newer content thats after S1.
HAH if you think YuYuYuS1 made you cry then the prequel novel NoWaYu will break you <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Still hoping for NoWaYu animation yet it will probably never happen no matter how much we wish for it <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Aaand now you know the full titles and why we simply call them YuYuYu, NoWaYu, WaSuYu and KuMeYu. Its just easier
YuYuYu - Yuuki Yuuna wa Yuusha de Aru (Yuki Yuna is a Hero) - main story with main cast
NoWaYu - Nogi Wakaba wa Yuusha de Aru (Nogi Wakaba is a Hero) - prequel novel of ||the first hero team||
WaSuYu - Washio Sumi wa Yuusha de Aru (Washio Sumi is a Hero) - prequel novel before the events of the main series which was made into the trilogy movie that was split into episodes in the 2nd season
KuMeYu - Kusunoki Mebuki wa Yuusha de Aru (Kusunoki Mebuki is a Hero) - side-story novel taking place inbetween the main events following ||the failures known as weeds||
I liked the ending. It did what it was suppose to do. And more satisfying than S1 because 1-2 years to get a freaking answer. There really is nothing left to say/talk about in the end there really. Its just not having NoWaYu animated that leaves us hanging a bit because reasons.
And i can guess at least maybe two of them being ||Susanoo because of certain abilities and Bishamoten for Gin's symbol||. That last one even more emotional for myth/symbolism reasons
They say ||its all the earthen gods but they mention some heavenly gods also sided with humanity||
One think i like about YuYuYu is trying to ||identify who the gods in Shinju could have been|| by identifying the heroes powers and whatnot
But it does make sense? ||it turned Yuna into a sorta God.|| and they reference the whole maiden sacrifice story how ||a pure soul/hero can create miracles|| so what do you do ||when even gods believe in you|| also she didn't do it alone ||GIIIIIIN *cries*||
At least YuYuYu explains the ending and gives a legitimate reason even if it took them forever to do so in the sequel. Gear is magical music deusexmachina cause music and ai desu yo
The one thing i am left wondering is what happened to Karin's brother. I do recall that he was apparently a high ranked official in the Taisha because he was a prodigy or something
Don't forget that ||most if not all the dumbass taisha are also gone so house cleaning is done||. I think even the creators said so iirc that ||the fight ended so everyone simply starts over|| so nothing else to really write/make. Maybe an after credits SoL one-shot thing but that's pretty much it. Please give NoWaYu <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
not one for reading novels and extra materials most of the time. but it was short enough and well i was already highly invested in it <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
and since the novel was already TL already i just went and read it instead. first time i did something like that too
huh didnt know the manga finished. last i remember it was still ongoing and still being translated
is the manga finished?
things will get much worse before you can see the light again. after you're done watching the YuYuYu prequel go read the prequel prequel novel before you watch the yuyuyu sequel just for all the extra extra emotions and more tears. it'll be worth it <:Ver:336656981144109066>
no. 12-14 depending on which series
Nobunagun is good stuff
Been forever since i saw it but ended up liking it overall. Maybe give it a rewatch sometime
And it would work
AKB0048xGear XDU crossover when
How do many things in CLAMP connect? One example is the marshmallow fat rabbit in the rayearth manga is none other than ||God|| which gets cut/changed/removed in the anime because original content. Then the manga Wish introduces a bunch of angels and whatnot. One of them is one tiny bunny with a flower who pops up in Kobato and is ||kinda God's messenger and is very powerful and can fuck you up|| so don't piss it off. Think i read somewhere that the sakura and lee in TRC are related to CCS Sakura and Lee but uuuh much crazy shenanigans and whatnot to explain and im not familiar with TRC.
Thing about the animes sadly is they tend to cut out some easter eggs and connections so they can stand alone i guess
Did someone mention CLAMP? Cause besides rayearth and cardcaptor sakura u also have Chobits, Angelic Layer and Kobato for some anime. Plenty of manga   and i guess in the mangaverse we got the multiverse and everything connects because of Tsubasa Resevoir Chronicles among other things
*sees the spoiler and INTENSE SCREAMING INTENSIFIES* AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH
I need to get it to replace my old dvds but ima keep the old physical stuff. Booklets and reversable covers.
Has a manga but i think the anime is better but they both hav some different story elements/twists than the other that i like from each.
<@99695384296701952>  pretty much angelic layer is a CLAMP work slice of life. Sorta a bit of busou shinki where u make some dolls n fight in tourneys but the dolls arent alive like busou shinki but controlled with a headset. MC moves to live with her aunt while looking/trying to meet her mom and her new daily life there. Ends up getting into the new doll game Angelic Layer.
no. we stay with database
dang good song that haunts your brain
lazy or genius?
and now DATABASE is running through my head again
as for log horizon, dont know how accurate the info on the wiki page is but the last jp novel publication was march 2018 with the english version being jan.2019
yes apparently so. just mentioning it cause he wrote both novel series
looked up about the log horizon author. there is an old reddit thread about it. says he didn't go to jail. he was simply put on house arrest because good behavior and paid a hefty fine and that's about it. he also writes MAOYU too btw.
Discotek is love. Discotek is life.
I think they confirmed english dubset first and then jpset later
Oh and dont forget the 3 versions of the chant songs
@Cypher Agreed
True fact Cross Ange is called Cross Ange because its a pun/silly word use because Ange is always Cross. Said so in one of the NextEp.Previews <:Ver:336656981144109066>
Also known as the "Nice Guy"
Didnt discotek license it iirc? Cant remember if its out yet or not
<@90164247643828224>  saw the movie when it aired and some of the series eps beforehand so it was nice to catch on things i missed too. Spinel's style and song was great. Love the retro they went with her. Also "dammit rose!"
oof then isn't that kinda hard when like 99.99% of anime has fanservice and whatnot. haven't watched granblem but heard its good. u might as well watch it before you show it to her just to make sure you can
Well u also gotta remember that besides the training regimen he also fought every single monster that crossed his path and had no idea about their "threat levels". He was just "dont know, dont care, its there, punch it." Also doesn't that one evil scientist from the very beginning that survived and opened a takoyaki shop with his gorilla cyborg talks about it if very little. Something something yes its a shitty training regimen but it was also Saitama's way of thinking/doing at the time and sticking to it or whatever (and still does despite his "loss of emotions") and by yes a mix of that and god level luck he broke that limit. It's nothing complex. It just is. So a lil serious but still gag. In theory yes anyone could if they could.
Oh and Toonami is going to air Demon Slayer in Oct.
Caught up to the recent demon slayer eps (well at least to free viewers in CR anyways). Good stuff <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
b-but crossovers and cameos so we can make crazy fan theories
yeah but im surprised we still dont have any gunpla LL yet. so inb4 LL modeled/colored Gunpla in the next Build Divers or something
inb4 love live gunpla
a feels train of course <:Ver:336656981144109066> <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
At least i think there was one scene in the anime that sorta made it seem that way but its been forever
But wait i couldve sworn MC WAS aware of all the girls feelings. He was simply avoiding it like the plague because "nope not gonna provoke the hornets nest. Pretend to b stupid"
Rakugo is great. Fight me. IS is trash no matter what tho. We can live in peaceful harmony in agreement.
*Hugs my Dai-Guard Chogokin* precious poor child
please give love and respect for the poor lovable paper mache robot who gets into lots of paper work trouble because his pilots are stupid but loves them nonetheless
someone mentioned/posted Dai-Guard opening earlier and just noticing that CR added Dai-Guard to its catalog. at least that poor fella can finally get some more recognition
So yeah just watch whichever precure catches your atention the most
So far behind precure viewing. Only saw 4 seasons. OG/Max, SplashStar and Heartcatch with a few eps. of 5 and Fresh but back then they werent finished subbed/got dropped
And i think the recent seasons had some oneshot special crossovers because of the crossover movie promos iirc
All seasons are about 48-49 eps give or take. Almost all of them are standalones. The only ones with sequels are OGPrecure/Maxheart and Precure5/5GoGo
Never saw vehicle. Only know of it cause of clips and pics. And my brothers telling me about it. Voltron i knew cause they had 2 eps recorded (supposedly they USED to have ALL of it recorded on VHS but my sister recorded over them with a goddamn soap/novela and only the first episodes escaped that horror which is all levels of BS) but then saw most of Voltron on Toonami
Ah true
But yeah thats just crazy
Excuse me VEHICLE voltron. Dont forget to westernize.
Voltron became its own thing and even got "adopted" or maybe more loved but doesnt stop GoLion, we can still get Yamato (speaking of i need to get the manga) and well then u got the hellhole that is Robotech/Macross
True. Its not like hatehate robotech just the HG (and i guess Tatsunoko) being dicks that irks everyone really
True
Maybe it was me but i think i liked MaxHeart more than OG. OG wasnt bad. It had some good points but felt like it dragged and MaxHeart felt better paced to me. Then again its been forever since i watched them.
Its a 48+ eps series of a large franchise for a young demographic yeah its gonna have M/VotW format but its not all bad. Some do it better than others. OG has it rougher for being the first and testing the waters but it has it great points when they hit.
Yeah OGPrecure is just very very rough early on. It is the 1st Precure after all. It does have its great moments from time to time tho.
Among other old anime eps were lost too
Big soft spot for J-Decker
If GGG isnt your type of Brave you can always try one of the others too
Gimme the sequel fffffff-
People hating on FINAL cause we didnt get our sequel
Iv been meaning to. Along with a giant backlog of anime. God haven't finished l-gaim and since i cant remember anything ill hav to start over
For some reason i could never get into Fighbird tho
That is probably the one thing that just made me go eh? Everything else is great tho
Lol true
What thing? ||the alien thing? Or the ai thing?||
And that's sorta the simple version of it i guess
Also possible time travel/au timeline shenanigans involved as well
And so the factions get split into Azur Lane and the Crimson Axis iirc
Plot hasnt really been touched much. But something something everyone used to work together to fight the sirens and then some turned traitor, because idk tired of "peace" or trying to prove whose superior idk and joined the sirens or accepted their offer for power and others followed them out of fear i guess?

With Symphogear you'd only need the show, the Shinai/OVAs, the keywords and the songs. With Nanoha its the series, movies, various mangas and drama cds to keep track

Hmmm looking about some sales were in March and April then DDay in May so yeah maybe around those 3 months
I sadly don't remember <:HibikiWhoops:585839808115507222>  but im assuming it was around the time when they announced the Symphogear license give or take.
Should save and wait for Discotek Day when Discotek put their stuff on sale. If you're lucky you'll buy almost everything available from them for $400. Or at least that's supposedly what someone calculated during last Discotek Day <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>  but obviously more new stuff incoming so it'll be more than that <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
I say buy everything except Rail Wars and Triage X <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Magic of Stella, Locodol, Godannar, Mitsubishi Colors, Hanayamata, Kinmoza, Kawai Complex, Sakamoto, School-Live, Flying Witch, Nozaki-kun. All good stuff. Oda Nobuna i think was good/nice. Beyond the Boundary... i dont remember much? Sasuga effects/animations as to expected of course tho. Rail Wars was meh iirc. Isn't Triage X made/related to one of the creators of Highschool of the Dead or something? Havent deen it. Haven't seen the others but i heard they were good iirc.

you'll understand don't worry <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Uncultured. You mean through the power of HANDHOLDING <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Soo what do you think are the chances of YuYuYui pulling a Gear and go Global. One can dream right <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Oh wait link works now. Had to wait a bit to load <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not working for some reason <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Oh and about the phones. Isn't it more about the app than the phone itself? Don't remember if Dess reached that part yet so just in case ||They have to get the app installed into their phoned to join the Club. Cause Club policy. Don't remember how Fu sold that to them but eh. And KuMeYu i think explained all candidates had it installed cause Shinju chooses who will be its heroes through it. So hey blame Shinju too.||
YuYuYui is the smartphone game right? Of course we get more or slightly better lore details/explanations in it that fills in stuff and not have TL for it Fffff-  I mean i know NoWaYu explains ||Takashimas BG from getting lots of divinity from visiting the shrine but just assumed she tapped into the reverse clap on her own and not an actual kami gift and that the other Yuna's "inherit" it because its natural to them. Eh close enough I guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
<@!297542051057238017> might wanna spoiler tag that cause Dess is watching YuYuYu and ||yeah Yuna is mentioned to have the greatest hero potential and any child who performs the reverse handclap from birth gets named Yuna. The reason for the tradition is "lost" but it is still done.||
Fu loosing her sight is probably being unable to see her sister
oh yes. its going to be sooo dang painful to watch <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>

You hold it in until the episode ends <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>
Seemed easy enough to follow (just gotta time ur pauses for them instant dialogue moments). Its just MC getting caught in supernatural shenanigans and keeps getting involved in them and all them crazy girls he knows/meets getting into trouble with them supernatural shenangigans because of their emotional baggages from XYZ reason and needing to uncover the puzzle/connection to solve them problems
Yes
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Note that Fuu tried to kill yuna a bunch but fairies stop it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Shhh wait for reaction. He gone quiet now
Good stuuuff
Ah yes the good stuff
She hasnt given everything yet after all <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Gooood stuff
Nah ||Togo is more special than that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ||
Also spoilers if we do so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
No
You'll find out eventually
Every family works for the government <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Time for more good stuff
Shinju gifts humanity
Yeah before they talked about a "virus" and Shinju saved humanity. They couldnt go beyond its barrier because no life could be sustained. Well those last parts werent lies <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<:Ver:336656981144109066> <:Ver:336656981144109066> <:Ver:336656981144109066> <:Ver:336656981144109066>

Soon SOOOOOON
<:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
It can take the power but hey if u still believe to be just then it wont i guess or somethibg like that
First half of S2/Movie trilogy is before. Second half of S2 is after S1
Bests lies are with a hint of truth <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Speech-to-text is failing
Because its fun <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Time for episode 11 <:Ver:336656981144109066>
ITS FINE. ITS FINE <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Everything is fine <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Its fine
ITS TIME
Well those names arent given in the series but in the prequel LN so no one would know
Itsuki <:MikuPraise:585839808765493249>
Nogi Wakaba is a hero Light Novels
I think it makes sense considering the prequel and the one important thing
The best hero is the self-sacrificing type apparently <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
2 eps per movie iirc
She's killing them faster and less painless i guess
HERO PUUUUUNCH
Their suplemented in Hero. So she just has to stay in hero mode at least
Note also after the fight. The girls get bathed in petals. Yuna does not
Offerings can be given back after all
Also note the fact the girls get their offerings back is hinted back when they were at the hotel when Fuu thought if eating the offerings iirc
The role reversal of the girls walking by river with Togo pushing Yunas wheelchair
Its fine. No worries at all <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
STAND PROUD <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Pay close attention to the end
Not by the power of a god or a miracle but the power of YURI <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
||probably||
Something about "connecting to the otherside" and thats where the vertex will enter from
Gin <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
I know. Damn you schools for ruining the immersion <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Too bad he's gonna skip the NoWaYu LN. I was looking forward to him punching the screen when he catches the hints of it in Season2 <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
Hmm that chart shouldve been all Haikyu for extra meme power
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Yeah next 2 movies are a ride
Cause reasons
"Only one" you say <:TsubasaSmug:585839805737467920>
that moment you play Azur Lane and recognize Zuikaku <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
well i mean Sonocchi says that line but still applies <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Gin is cute in any clothing!! <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
LET'S ENJOY KAGAWA LIFE!! <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
oh good. time for some good stuff then <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
ROOOOOCK <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
no other reason
simple answer is they hate humans and wants us dead. complex answer they are fed up with humans and want us dead
ah so u saw episode 4 already <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Yuki Yuna is a Hero - Washio Sumi Chapter movie trilogy (also known as the first half of S2)
Yuki Yuna is a Hero
now go cry <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
TRIVIA - the guns name is Shirogane. it is written using the Kanji for Gin
Shirogane
if i remember right its the bridge incident that killed Fuu/Itsuki's parents... or was that the Gin fight before
and yet they still didn't tell them. but hey its like how Yuna said in S1 its no one's fault (except the gods of course)
there is an assumption that once they wiped humanity they would fix the world and make it perfect/ the way they want with no humans in it
they destroy the world so humanity doesn't have anywhere else to go
gods are spiteful bastards. Shinju did call them hypocrites after all <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
no. they want us extinct and they want Shinju dead for siding with us <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
okey dokey
well there will a be a scene with a laptop monitor. HOPEFULLY your subs have that TL so you can read it. unless its too hard to read for you cause tiny text but its very important and hint-y. when you finish Movie 3 we'll give a small summary of NoWaYu and maybe a pic of the MCs for very important reasons <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ah ok
halfway?
u started movie 3 yet?
well a bunch of shit happens inbetween before we get to this point but thats about it <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
they are fed up with us, find us as abominations who think we are above others and we don't respect the gods and the order of life. they find us to be assholes so they want us dead. Shinju be saying the Gods are a bunch of hypocrites so it sides with humans and here we are <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
was working on that but not finished <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah go ahead
id assume it has more to do with her lost memories and taking advantage of that to get Yuna
And now i think you are ready for YuYuYuS2. Get ready for some good stuff <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Now someone donate a pic of the NoWaYu team and the KuMeYu team for visuals cause im on the phone and everything looks shitty <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Redactions <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
TIME SKIPS TO YUKI YUNA - TRIVIA remember i said that Karin ||was "carefully selected" right? That means there are more candidates besides the Yuki Yina Hero Club. There were A LOT. In fact there were "Hero Clubs" in other schools. All of them had the Hero app installed so Shinju could pick its chosen. It picked the Yuki Yuna Club. The other Clubs/candudates were deemed failures.|| The Taisha after S1 ||pretty much call those failures "Weeds" since they didnt become "flowers". Still had their uses tho. They made them into soldiers/sentinels with far weaker powers than Heroes identified in green armor to go beyond the border and investigate the outside.|| There is an LN of it called Kusunoki Mebuki is a Hero. KuMeYu. But you could skip it. All you need to know is that there are failures called "Weeds". But their still just as heroic. So dont look down on them lightly <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
Wakaba and Hinata did succeed in becoming high ranking people because their families the Nogi's and Uesato's have extremely high prestige but of course probably a lot of bad Taisha decisions happened after they passed away.
So the Taisha covered it all up, went into "hiding" but also controlling the government and information
More stuff happened afterwards which is explained in the YuYuYui smartphone game like ||because of their fear it lead to a faction of humans worshipping the heaven gods and tried to assist in killing Shinju||
What else am i missing... ah right 2 things of course. There are reasons WHY in Yuki Yuna the government said humanity is killed by a virus and the world is uninhabitable because of it. They altered their history and covered it all up. ||Firstly back when the Gods attacked some of the surviving humans developed a fobia of the sky called Sky Syndrome. Chikage's mother was one of them as an example. Secondly cause of the population's fear and distrust of heroes which lead to them turning against the heroes back when Anzu and Tamako died.||
Their reasoning for the decision was to protect the Heroes reputation.
As for ||Chikage, her worst fear was being forgotten. She hoped even one person would remember her. Of course fate decided to be cruel to her like that <:MikuSad:336657015961026560> || At least Wakaba and Hinata arent gonna let that happen to easily. Heroes are stubborn. Fuck the Taisha.
Yes. Oh gotta clarify something about NoWaYu ||Wakaba and team NEVER met Utano in person. They talked by radio or something. It was the only way to make contact with the outside. Utano and Nagano Region slowly made less and less contact until her last message when she leaves everything to Wakaba.||
Because part if the deal ||was for humans to not  use god powers anymore. AKA Hero system. Wakaba and Hinata and the Taisha had been working on making a new hero system in secret. It took 300 years. And guess what happened in WaSuYu||
Oh now that you finished Washio story we can mention the ONE freaking detail they forgot to freaking put in the movies/tv version and i just remembered <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>  you can read this ||Ok SO Gin died but her body was recovered. They got her transformation terminal back. They UPGRADED it too and after "careful selection" passed it to another hero candidate... that was Karin. Karin uses Gin's transformation terminal. Now go rewatch Karin's big fight from episode 11|| <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Oh right forgot one more big detail about Takashima Yuna. You can read this once you read the summary above ||Because she was merged with Shinju she became "divine" and the Taisha now worship her and any baby girl who performed the reverse handclap at birth was to be named Yuna in her honor|| What that means is explained a bit more in the smartphone game but wont go into any more detail until you finish S2 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!471416654346321930> here's your terribly made summary of NoWaYu because I derp. if you have any questions let us know
wait is overdess still around
ffffff-
and missing some details
fffff- so many typos now that i notice
obviously skimmed over stuff.

but ok. lemme save it real quick then
aaaaw but then we don't redact it <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
ill spoiler it just in case too
Nogi Wakaba is a Hero summary
OK got the summary ready as best as i could
just a bit more <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
almost done with the summary <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
speaking of... the Kizuna movie isn't even out and they gonna run a reboot of Adventure01 in... April i think it was. do not know how to feel about that <:ChrisDespair:607743600545234970>
DIGIMON ARE THE CHAMPIONS <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
sailor moon for me which lead to my descent into anime life/fandom and i blame/thank my brother for introducing it to me <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Do not know if Shirabot complimenting or not. Also Shirabot predictingNoWaYu trilogy or being evil <:MichaWhat:336657148627124225>
well to be fair i hear Interviewers anime spiced it up more than the manga version? then again considering the other licenses Funi has idk what to think of it. havent watched Interviwers so idk
i believe so
pretty sure they stole dororo <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
they still get stuff i think. and other licensing companies also use them as an extra platform from time to time
well some think it might be related with the Funi license since they are the ones who had it. like they might have made a deal with Amazon to stream it there too. but who knows

yeah i think so
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
Weird. The image of it isnt in the wiki anymore?
Well maybe not exactly "female" but that Rising in the manga has a far more leaner body frame making her look more feminine. Probably since Rain pilots it  and the whole Rain vs Allenby thing going later or idk. Yamato Nadeshiko thing going probably.
You know, with the recent use of manga versions (Shin Mazinger Zero, Crossbone i think) you'd think it be a great excuse for SUPER Nobel Gundam and female version Rising Gundam <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
CHAMBER IS A WONDEFUL BOT <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>

<:Ver:336656981144109066>
same <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
must be mixing it with some other show or something <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and yet delicious. looks like chocolate. i want dammit <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
must be imagining things <:GarieWink:336657101273169921>
<:Ver:336656981144109066>
and then after you finish S2 i can link to the Matsuri Live reading of the EXTENDED final episode. someone posted it on YT with subs
these 6 episodes are still <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>  though
she acts spacey cause she just wants to chill and enjoy kagawa life <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
they pretended to collapse to scare her. it backfired on them
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
Nogi being so chill about not having any fairy protection
it makes sense when you realize it sucks up Shinju's energy
karin passing her bad habits to itsuki <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Sono-chan got "mad" and made them hand them over. dont mess with Sono-chan <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
hnnn some fan speculating the blank gravestone is for ||Washio since she "died" during the Bridge thing|| it would be weird if it was for ||Chikage since she's suppose to have been erased and only the C in the mural is suppose to be representing her||
yeah. this episode. dont read
i assume its the ||Togo thing||. on the one hand it has to do with her ||her unhealthy loss of Gin|| on the other its a bit much
this train doesnt stop <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> !!
its fine. ITS FINE <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
it only exists if you believe in it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
its only a curse if you believe it is <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
schrodinger's cat <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
some of the music during this part reminds me of Shin Sekai Yori
must be their holy wavelength powers <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
so yes Sonogo is a beeeaaaast <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>  and our wonderful airhead <:MariaWhat:672245553920344080>
yeah all so ||she could see if they would be able to survive/deal with the wall breaking which leads to the stuff in S1 final||
but let's go back a bit and talk about how badass Sonogo is. implications from extra material and the PSP games that she ||planned the events of the S1 final (telling the truth to Togo which would then make her snap and destroy the wall) to cause a coup against the Taisha and Shinju to "teach them a lesson" about lying to the heroes about the Sange system|| and she did imply back in S1 ||that as she was back then she could easily take down the Hero Club if she wanted to.||
next 4 episodes are gonna be one hell of a ride
https://yuyuyu.fandom.com/wiki/Hero_History_Apocrypha
ok yeah we getting a new book trilogy but its all extra content about "the people who don't fight". 3 volumes with stories taking place in 3 different moments. collectively called "Hero History Apocrypha". the first story is called "Uesato Hinata is a Hero" with the 1st chapter out recently and already TL'ed online.
but yeah everything is prequel and or side story
well apparently there are going to be more books? its listed in the wiki
ah yes when the Taisha tried to give Sonogo her Terminal and tried to ||guilt trip her by using Gin's name and literally called BS on their antics|| <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
i know. just hyped right now
b-but the train <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
nooooooooooooo <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580> !!!
well i mean you can't ||loose your body if you already lost it and got it replaced already|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
this train is accelerating even faster and its not stopping <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> !!!
ah shit the Karin part always gets me
Togo has well trained fairies <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
when you realize that in the extra materials and looking back into S1 and WaSuYu it's implied Togo's constant guarding of Yuna ||is caused by her loss of Gin||
this train doesn't stop <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> !!
hmmm perhaaaaps
fair
aaah ok
that whole scene hurt <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>
and like this plan wouldn't backfire at all <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
you'll see what they mean soon enough <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
i mean it could partially be gay. we don't know the full list of ||gods that make up the Shinju|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
oh shit just barely made it to see dess continue YuYuYu
this is a ||300 year war|| coming to an end after all
maybe since you didnt feel much for the spirits popping up?
at most its just some extra dialogue and thoughts of the characters but its still there
and now go watch this live reading of the "extended" version of the Final <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> 
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wa3kH2YbzrU
HERO CLUB FIGHT OOOOOON <:MariaYell:336657352264646657> !!!
she did promise to support future generations after all <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
then no. thats not washio
that wasnt Washio
pretty much ||the ritual wont save humanity, only those who undergo and believe in it will "ascend", you wont be human anymore, you're just merging with Shinju, the Heaven Gods still want Shinju dead||
your just turning into a plant. a nicer bigger target for the heaven gods
the ritual wont save humanity
salute Togo ship <:KirikaSalute:620069889838809089>
and her family is descendant or was saved by the white hair hero from the mobage. hence why she is her amazing senpai/one-chan/etc
yes she is
the game story isn't canon but the backstory for the characters are canon
(Shiratori and the 2 from the phone game but i guess since they never met them they dont know what they look like but they do have graves)
of course. they would never erase a person from the records. not at all <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
ah yes how strange the Nogi Wakaba mural has 4 people. how very strange. Hmmm what is that weird looking C shaped shadow? it looks like a 5th person could fit in that spot <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
note the 3 murals in the monument gravesite are the 3 hero groups Nogi Wakaba, Washio Sumi and the Yuki Yuna Club. You can see a clearer image of them in the OP sequence <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and that wasn't explained either in S1. all you know is that ||the world got fucked up by the Gods yet SOMEHOW humanity had lived this long somehow and the YuYu Club just stopped the most recent attack and miraculously recover and nothing changed at all||
the novel shouldve been made into an anime
the ritual that protected the "promise" is ||the same one Togo was going to do in S2 but that needed like 6 or so mikos||. she was more valuable and more effective than the first original ritual because ||she was both a hero and miko|| so she alone would've been enough for it
nope
they just got more info on how to fight the Vertex. that's it. and back then, after S1, they didnt talk about a possible sequel or anything. just prequel books stuff to set up the Background info
^
even worse when it kept getting compared with Madoka at the time
plus in the end nothing changed ||the world was effed up|| so people complaining about cliffhanger ending
when ||they got their "offerings back" and yuna miraculously recovering||
to smart people it makes sense. but people complained about the "deus ex machina" ending and blahblah and took like 2 years(?) before S2 came out because they were publishing the novels, etc
haha you'd think S1 did. you have no idea how much complaining happened when S1 ended. that was something <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
at the very least the NoWaYu, WaSuYu and KuMeYu LN covers all the necessary details for the ending of S2
i know. but YuYuYu was promoted as a multimedia franchise so it was gonna have lots of extra content outside of the tv series. at the very least everyone wants a Nogi Wakaba anime but of course we never got it <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
not really out of nowhere. the plans Aki talked about are mentioned and tested in KuMeYu and after Togo ||blew the hole in the wall||, ||Shinju dying|| and ||Heaven Gods|| being extra extra pissed so there was nothing left.
Other possibilities would be the Mazinger Z Infinity movie, Mazinkaiser OVA and the mini short Dynamic promos that came with the Shin vs Neo Getter that were meant to introduce Mazinkaiser. Oh and Mazinkaiser SKL too i guess. The good thing is that they are all short. And dont remind me the Shin Mazinger didnt get a sequel fffffff- <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
also the amusement that MAO, the VA for Vanessa in Symphogear XV, is Papika <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
HMMMMM true
coin flip. best 2 of 3
and im happy it did get its sequel cause even i knew Yuna wasnt ok in the end of S1 so their story didnt end at all
hey i like the show, but i am telling you about the complaints that it got. yes its about the YuYu Club but it has one heck of a complex background and you got this team of girls caught in the mess. in the end they survived it but the world isn't saved (at the time) and since there was no info for a sequel and how morbid the situation truly was that meant that all they did was for nothing. and of all people you had to "trust the Taisha". like if they werent going to put another group through hell and back or even worse than the YuYu Club
all got their stuff back because it was hinted shinju could do that and he gave it back, you can tell by the petals, yet yuna didnt have any petals and just "wakes up"
yeah they did but just that they attacked and hint at the timeframe of 300 years but nothing else. just here is the most recent people fighting it out. they stop it but loose their hero titles and nothing changed. but hey they survived it and they are healthy so that's good. no real answers or plans per say for the future. and like a said, they didn't talk about a possible sequel at all back then.
NoWaYu has so much stuff that it needs its own anime. even so they would probably cut stuff. they cut the WaSuYu detail about ||Karin getting Gin's terminal|| for example
you were talking about details that should've been explained in S2. im pointing out they werent explained either in S1
ah dammit now i notice the pun <:MariaYell:336657352264646657>
well considering proto-maria was blonde sure go ahead and put a mask on her <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
hell go ahead and put a different mask on Fine, Ryoko, Maria, Kiri and Shirabe (put Serena in there too) for the extra memes <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Ok but just letting u kno if u ever decide to continue and watch ZZ
iirc
Wouldnt u still be forced to watch the Zeta TV series because the movie ending is different
While i havent seen Golden Kamuy yet one quick google search shows she's the MC girl of the show. Literally on the covers/posters/etc. and assuming a badass or something
did someone say groovin magic. i heard grooving magic <:TsubasaPeek:623246193002151938>
dat stop motion yoh <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Yeah i saw some pics and liked a few of them but my money is now elsewhere <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Not at home so no pics. Poorly built and no paint but hey i was a smol and no idea how to gunpla. Brother helped too. Still love my good boy nonetheless <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Good culture <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
I still have my model kit rokusho even if he is a bit beat up <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>
You sure Digimon isnt a reboot? Summary i saw last time talked about the beginning plot and changed the whole thing. Unless your confusing it with the Tri shorts that were promoting the movie that are posted on YT
It was iirc. Plot was based on 1-2 of the games
oh nothing much ||was traveling about with the aliens that saved his life|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Rokusho SPOILERS ||he gets his partner back. he wasnt dead after all|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Well like i said rewatched S1 not too long ago. So much silliness <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
A good badass rogue with a bit of an existential crisis on his search for the meaning of his life and has a robot parrot for a friend <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>
So stylish
Pepper Cat
So the ||champion wins. Yeah victor. Forgot his name|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Its ||WarBandit||
A bunch of characters ftom S1 just get axed in S2
Rokusho is NOT S1 Rokusho iirc
So no Phantom either
Along with the clerk guy. Arcbeetles human. Whatever his name was
Mr referee is not in S2
Worse was no Mr.Referee. how fucking dare they <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
English boxset is out iirc AND a JP boxset will be out sometime too
Also discotek licensed Medabots
<@238855496797257729>  aaw missed out on the medabots talk. Anyways, nice giant S2 metabee. Got home so here's my old Rokusho. Funny, recently marathoned S1 in english in YT. Shenanigans happened at the finals so the match and the whole thing got postponed. After things got cleared up they got their rematch and episode ends when they about to fight. Credits and then S2 imply that Ikki ||lost||. Finished S1 and tried to start S2 but goddamn the dub and changes were so bad i stopped on the 1st episode. Gotta prepare myself mentally for that if i try again <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> . Lots of people say watch S1 and pretend S2 never happened.
Thanks for the heads up <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
That Pokemon news wtf. Nope. Nope. Will not believe until i see actual video <:FineShocked:672430513025187840>

good times good times
and then he scared the shit out of us by dying but then he was an egg so it was ok
the funny one is holy digimon. we getting angemon(seraphimon)/angewomon(ophanimon or magnadramon) right of the bat <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ?
<:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
he was being a "edgy loner dude". he ran off as soon as tai suggested working together or trying to introduce himself, etc. he was being reasonably smart and not letting it get in the way of the big picture this time tho <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
im more wondering if hikari gets ophanimon or magnadramon. betting ophanimon
also obviously matt having issues so we might not see omegamon again until later. yeah sure a nuke forces him to join forces to help save his family but anything else nah
possibility omegamon runs out of power and "dies" so agumon and gabumon reincarnate in the village of beginnings maybe

weird im not finding anything about this being 13 episodes....
its possible? wasnt tai getting ready to go to camp anyways before the whole shenanigans happened?
its only 13 episodes?
well to be fair S2 onward they didnt need the physical crests anyways. they just didnt digivolve properly cause of plot reasons at first
doesnt seem that way? yet? i mean right off Tai and Matt had the symbols on their digidevices and Hikari/TK had thirs pop up when they touched the feathers

Altered fights/events/endings
Gurren Lagann movies should be watched tho
Nah. First 2 madoka movies can be skipped. On the one hand they reanimate/make some scenes more fancy. On the other they cut a whole bunch on stuff from the beginning. Ex. The opening sequence from eps1 and Mami interactions. At most you could watch the ending song from the 2nd movie (not sure if its the same in the 1st) because of the last tidbit at the end. Either way it plays out like the series.
You can always try watching the movies even if they do change some events <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Day Break Illusion was interesting at first. Didnt care much for the ending though

<:MikuCry:688397678584791074>
And i guess the rights passed to Go Nagai/Dynamic Pro because they worked together in Dynamic Pro and were such bros
Oh and the original Getter Robo Saga (manga) is fully TL so you can read that too... and suffer in never getting a proper ending like the rest of us because Ken Ishikawa (the creator of Getter) died <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
"Shin Getter vs Neo Getter" (4 eps), "Getter Robo Armageddon/Change! Getter Robo The Last Day of the World" (13 eps), "New Getter Robo" (13 eps). Aaaand of course there is also "Getter Robo Go" (50 eps) but we do not speak of that.
Also Minerva 👏 deserves👏 more👏 love👏
The manga is "incomplete" tho. The first story "Shin Mazinger Zero" is fully TL already thankfully. But the sequel story "Shin Mazinger Zero vs the General of Darkness" hasnt been TL yet. The group that finished TLing SMZ did say their planning to hopefully work on it at some point tho.
Yes please do <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
Which Shin Mazinger? Because you have Shin Mazinger Impact (the anime) and Shin Mazinger Zero (the manga). Both having completely different plot/story and focus even if it is Mazinger Z tho SRW does try to combine them somewhat <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Either way, let us pray... NoWaYu Anime please <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>
Their 3 different stories taking place in different times tho iirc. The first in the NoWaYu era. The 2nd would be years afterwards ||post-nogi death iirc|| and the third... in the present iirc(?) Or something like that
Yeah
Which we do have at the moment. Some side-story publications going iirc
Inb4 more novels then <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Inb4 its an anime based on the phonegame which... would not be bad cause all the Heroes interacting would be <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>
Years begging for a NoWaYu anime and nothing <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Go watch <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
But anyways YuYuYu is great. Great characters and interactions. Lots of silliness... so the feels hurt more <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Expect the usual "they have super strong bonds" thing but they dont hook up
You asked me if it had yuri. I gave an honest answer. It has it but not what you'd hope for
HibiMiku is pure canon and you gotta jump through hoopsto deny. As for YuYuYu girls have scenes and feels but because whether because of story or "reasons" they ||never really hook up|| so yes id say its yuribait.
Well if you like Gear, Madoka and  magical girls in general then you will probably like this too so go ahead
Nogi Wakaba Yuusha de Aru (Nogi Wakaba is a Hero) is a prequel novel to the Yuki Yuna is a Hero anime. Magical Girl Heroes defending the last human populated place in the world from "monsters" (spoiler reasons). Hmmm i guess it does have some yuri/yuribait and feels. Lots of feels. The <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> kind

welp decided to pick up on watching some PreCure. decided for one i never finished because of lack of subs and/or interest so went with Fresh!PreCure. last time was years ago and it only had 4 subbed eps but i just couldn't seem to get into it anyways for some reason and no one wanted to continue subbing it at the time so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095> . noticed its fully subbed now and decided to restart it cause why not and actually enjoying it this time. guess having a FRESH start helps <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063> . already at eps.6 and wooo that episode is kinda morbid when you think about it. the monster being ||a chalkboard that erases ANYTHING in real life that gets drawn and then erased on its board... so of course it erases all mothers including Love's mom and she sees it happen <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206> ||

oh wait no. thats eps.21. not 22 but still
misleading or spoilery? cause Eps.22 iss ||You are the Fourth Cure|| which is the ||haha PSYCHE no 4th this episode<:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>|| and Eps23 is ||The end of Eas. Cure Passion Appears|| or something like that which is the ||the reveal||. hmm maybe its because i'm already spoiled that it didn't affect me but the title i guess is a bit misleading and if it still is then it did what it was suppose to do. trick us all <:HibikiFingerguns:688429715836502063>
Fresh!PreCure eps.23 - to be fair i was already spoiled long ago on who it was going to be and the lead up doesn't hide it very well (the title card doesn't help either lol seriously Toei <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187> ) but still really well done on the introduction *chef kiss* <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
emotional ||pet episodes|| also get me every time <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>

im not gonna judge its dancing CG since i think thats the first time they did an ED like that so not surprising its so rough. and i guess i was more complaining that the title screen for the new OP is just the main three posing and a giant floating head of the 4th Cure and then at the end during their "big fight" against the monster the 4th Cure just pops up in the back doing nothing. what? at least they had the decency to reanimate the end sequence when Chiffon jumps into their arms at the end. <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Ep.28 Fresh!PreCure - Goddammit another emotional episode. Freaking pulling the old ||emotional memories of grandparents|| card <:HibiMikuCry:586026583870013455>
continuing FreshPreCure watching. noticed they finally changed the opening. its lazy as hell. those edits yoh. at least have the decency to make something good <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> ED is nice though. like the 1st EDsong better though
A mighty NEED <:Germain:421434126856486912>
watched a bit more of Fresh!PreCure. Up to ep.34. kinda obvious the identity of the big mcguffin of the show but ||man those dead soulless eyes freaked me out at the end there. creepy soulless eyes <:HibikiDespair:688429715450757206> ||
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-01/mayu-watanabe-retires-from-entertainment-industry-for-health-reasons/.160121
Fresh!PreCure Ep43 the freaking monster of the week being freaking ||Biollante||. good culture <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>  also ||tiny baby Chiffon kicking ass and taking names. such a good lil baby fairy. she's grown so much. so proud of her <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>||
Its not my favorite but it was good. Heartcatch still my fav tho only seen that, Futari wa/MaxHeart, SplashStar, a bit of Pre5 (which ill probably rewatch from the beginning again anyways whenever) and now Fresh. Have a lot of catching up to do <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-02/2nd-seitokai-yakuindomo-film-delayed-due-to-covid-19/.160206
Finished Fresh!PreCure. Ah yes welcoming our ||evil computer overlords|| and of course Cure Peach ||gets the more distinct outfit change in their final form <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>||. Also of course ||the mystical magical voice that saves all is "Cure Cure Puripu!"|| Truly magical words. Also ||Hohoemina! Nico Nico <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>!||. Ah yes ||Love not giving an answer to the poor boy at the end. Sasuga Toei <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>||. Also the biggest MOST IMPORTANT lesson of this show is that the TRUE salvation ||of the multiverse|| IS ||Donuts <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>||. Oh and the final episode i saw included a "Get your happiness" counter. A total of 32 times apparently though i feel like it was more than that <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. On that note Fresh!PreCure was pretty good. Cure Berry and ||Cure Passion|| being my favorite transformations and I'm so proud of Chiffon. ||That's my lil baby fairy kicking ass and taking names <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>||. Ended up liking it more than I thought. Of course starting FRESH and in the mood to watch anime helps <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
Umaru is the one with the "perfect" sis turning into a lil chibi snack eating, game obssesed, lazy gremlin right? It has its cute moments, relatable when surrounded by delicious snacks and gaming and having a good time but my god she could get reaally unlikable and i was thiiiiis close to dropping it a few times when she was being unbereable. Only saw S1 so far and its been a while tho
well you can blame the main bad guy for the ||institutionalized racism|| and he's a whole other level of f*cked up cause <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
don't forget the whole just ||killing/using none magic people as disposable soldiers|| among other things
OK i have decided and prepared myself mentally to watch PreCure5 (and then GoGo so yaaaay 100 eps <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> ). OK let's get started- Oh hi Guy Shishioh. I see you're playing a baddie this time around. Unacceptable <:MikuDelete:661660028410920990>
but doesnt have that big of an oomf in english <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
closes equivalent would be something like... "goddammit"
much cussing yes
uuuuuh not argentinan but do speak spanish. do not repeat what Hectan said <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
for reasons the big main plot of the show doesn't get covered until later. also as a multimedia project it has at least 2 novels that act as prequels (1 that gets adapted in the first half of S2) and a side-story spinoff that goes into more details.
yes
i saw fansubs for S2 but i heard about the horrors of the amazon subs <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
of course Guy Shishioh is defeated by the flames of COURAGE- i mean FRIENDSHIP <:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
ok PreCure5 eps2 - wtf Okuyasu you're here too <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
and hey at least it eventually gave us Ange hanging out with the Mazinger/Getter crew in SRW games and them having a hell of a good time hating and telling the bad guys to f*ck off <:Ver:704169051391524875>
but hey Ange at least ||helped her sister in the end|| remember? by ||threatening for her to either get the fuck up or die||. good family wholesomeness <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

because people have no tastes <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Oh My God
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interest/2020-06-05/pokemon-kids-tv-releases-looney-tunes-inspired-anime-short/.160290
enjoying the show so far though. better than the first time i tried watching it.
at ep.12 of PreCure5. ah yes more of the crazy reporter girl cause we gotta have at least 1 of these characters somewhere and a little meta amusement park show... at TOEI Amusement Park <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> also as for earlier episodes, show please stop ||awkwardly trying to set Nozomi up with Coco||. its just weird as hell <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Ep.25 - Finally they ||start getting some wand weapons|| and Cure Dream ||blasting them in the face|| Good job <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
At PreCure5 Ep.24 - ah yes ||just summon a giant fucking butterfly wand shaped platform, stand on it, spread some magic butterfly wings, ram it at the enemy, kill them and then just fly home||. Sasuga PreCure <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
at ep.19 of PreCure5. Gosh dang ||Urara's Mom episode and bringing in the water works. Dad and Gramps are lvable dorks too. Such a sweet family|| <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
If its the same review i saw that was both hilarious and morbid. Poor show going through so many big oofs in its lifetime <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
yes she is and just wait till you get to know more about the others too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>. gotta make sure you get attached to them after all <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
PreCure5 Ep.34 = Jiiya still such a good lovable caring granpa butler <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>. Also Karen channeling her inner sakimori in defending the sick by ||duking it out with the enemy in a spear vs water blade fight while riding a white horse|| <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765>. Actually, Charlie ||the horse|| being an MVP and a boss. Putting him on my ||best horse companions list alongside Fuunsaiki|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> .
yes
you're 2 eps away from finishing S1 anyways <:MariaWink:688836868736811148>
i look forward to your reaction to eps11 <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
don't forget the OP also adds ||Karin once she joins too|| and the ED is sung by different characters and has minor changes depending on the eps iirc too<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-09/crunchyroll-adds-mon-colle-knights-anime-to-catalog/.160441

Yuna ||subconsciously didnt want to fight and gave up|| meanwhile togo ||as crazy as she was being was still fighting and truly believed it was for the better||
perfect. such a lovely picture <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
spoiler <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Finished PreCure5. that's uh some way to end it. Didn't expect ||Bunbee to just get killed off with no fanfare||. On one hand kinda disappointing but on the other kinda in character to what was going on at the time. ||Milk getting despaired was intense even though i knew she would be ok because FRIENDSHIP and PreCure|| and ||Kawarino getting what he deserved by Bloody's hand was a chef kiss|| but the biggest surprise was ||big bad getting talked-no-jutsu||. Wasn't expecting that. Pretty good Cure season. Will start PreCure5GoGo after i take a break.
<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
you also have kekko kamen and the abarishi family. which ryoma? getter ryoma? he and Getter in general are not in Zero iirc. every cameo is from some other Nagai work. can't name them all though
also can't have a Nagai based series without some other Nagai series Cameos <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830>
i just love that Minerva gets some freaking focus and development... after being shelved or ignored or literally FORGOTTEN *cough*OGMazingerZTV*cough*
its Nagai. every female character has it rough <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
oh hey they also have the Getter Saga in their list if you want some Getter. go read that and suffer like the rest of us who've read it <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
note that group DPS tled/co-op tled a bunch of Nagai works so you can also look at their list and see what else catches your eye
read again. it says 5 "volumes". not chapters <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
let's see.. OG Mazinger Z by Nagai, OG Great, OG Grendizer, Angels, Otome, God Mazinger, SR Retsuden, Z vs Transformers and a couple of oneshots i think are tled in english
https://mangadex.org/title/5911/mazinger-z
have you read Mazinger Angels? i think its a pretty good spin off and gives the main ladies a chance to shine as MCs.
fuck yeah <:Germain:421434126856486912>
all i know is that the same group that finished TLing Zero said they also plan to do MZvGGD but they didn't give a date or anything at the moment. they have other projects and Zero in general was apparently tough to edit/etc. not surprised. it went through like what? 2-3 other groups before it was finished
i know <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
<@!279341087494242304> yeah it hasn't been TLed yet
thought this was a nice article

ok so ANN finally posting about the Shaman King remake and apparently article confirms they will adapt the whole manga. also reprints of the complete ED manga and reruns in JP streaming sites. i hope it gets license rescued for EN. i want that complete ED manga <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>  https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-11/shaman-king-manga-gets-brand-new-tv-anime-next-april/.160544

Also yes i remember that one article the author said he wanted the old cast if they ever made a remake. So either he got what he wanted oooor they made a compromised. Also LET THERE BE LIIIIGHT. REVIVE A SOOOUUUL~ <:ChrisPresents:672578363176517642>
Excuse me, what? Shaman King remake what? 2021 what? WHAT? AAAAAAAAAAAH <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024> <:Germain:421434126856486912> <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714> <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760> <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625> <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870> <:ShirabeAwe:698939825113268306> <:KirikaMegane:585848185847676939> <:MariaYell:336657352264646657> <:MariaBliss:688836867390439585> <:Euphoria:688429724032172116> <:ElfneinAAA:672437636362665984> <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> <:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
And depending on story he's a prick to everybody until he gets his ass properly kicked anyways so we skip all that to when he's already friendly <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
And Tetsuya is soldier boi with daddy issues anyways <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Well the OVA was suppose to focus on Kaiser cause "the new strong replacement thing" and another bajillion retcon/alter story so not surprised. And Great did come back at the end iirc? Plus then the KaiservGGD movie and since this is an alter story kinda thing im not surprised. Didnt mind really. Now Z STILL getting shafted and thrown in a museum <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
And dont remind me of Mazinkaiser OVA. That was painful to watch the first time and my brother developing a strong "dislike" for Kaiser. Same way I had a strong "dislike" to Getter G because of the Armageddon story. It worked too well <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Z and Great have always been punching bags once a "new stronger bot" shows up. The old "passing the torch to the next gen bot the painful way". Their both punching bags to Kaiser. Z less so depending on his story and that he now has his super forms TrueKaiser/Zero. So Great became everyones punching bag because getting left behind. Until we finally got EmperorG in SRW so now he has that. Still a punching bag tho <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Nobody likes Great anyways <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
That... that went too well together <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505> lol
ep.5 - DAMMIT i know this series is older but I just CAN'T unhear/unsee Okuyasu (JoJoDiU) being a little shit and trolling Dio (JoJo-SC) <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
at ep.3 - Mailpo is an adorable diligent lil mailbox. Gonna deliver aaaaall that mail and NOTHING will stop him!
oh and that suspicious evil guy in ep.1 sounding a bit too much like Dio and I looked it up just to make sure and I am no longer surprised as to why <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
started up PreCure5GoGo. just finished ep.1. i see a familiar face in the opening. Guess i was wrong <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. As for the rest of the episode, ||god dammit nozomi what the fuck. just reach a whole new level of stupid and just show off the god damn rose pact to the OBVIOUS evil suspicious guy why don't you. by far the most dense shit you had ever done in your life holy shit||. on that note they raised the budget on the transformations. looking very nice <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>. also recognizing some very sailor moonish poses in said transformations too, geeeee i wonder why <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> *cough*Toei*cough*
well Devilman isn't a happy picnic either but wooo Lady and Jack take it further
OGCutie Honey has no proper manga ED iirc but it and some of the spin-offs are fully TLed. The shows are also fully fansubbed too iirc. Devilman is fully TLed. It has 2 alter "sequels", Devilman Lady and Violence Jack but you dont need to read if you dont want to. Lady is fully TLed. Violence Jack is still being TLed but you have plenty of material to read though VJ and Lady are very fucked up stories.
<:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Super Robot rules - you do NOT go after the MC's loved ones in some sick twisted game of cat and mouse. The brutal death they will bring upon you later will be 1000% more painful than you think and you will wish you didnt
not sure how it isnt. the whole point of the movie was taking place some time after the OVA. Koji already had Kaiser, Lori and Loru are around and get their proper mecha because the Mazinger Army was built during the timeskip and Sayaka got a "new" Venus (this one more based to the one from the OGmanga) because she ||lost the OVAVenus in the OVA||. GGD knew of the shitfest that happened in the OVA and so did a sneak attack to try to kill Koji and everyone around him so he couldnt get to Kaiser. Of course that backfires horribly on him
gotta remember KaiservGGD movie is a direct sequel to the Kaiser OVA <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
that's cause he never really had an extensive backstory. they were just ||2 people Hell experimented and spliced together and was just loyal to him and that was it. Failing to do his job and being comic relief and even though Hell mistreated them he did in fact care for his incredible loyalty. Asura was always his favorite minion than anyone else||. No they and Hell weren't in KaiservGGD. ||they were killed in the Kaiser OVA||
yeah i loved his new backstory. one of the best things done in that show
this was published alongside the MazingerZImpact anime iirc soooo <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
checking. not to long ago actually. Mazinger Zero was published June2009-december2012. MZvGGD was Feb2013-Jan.2016 while ||Pacific Rim|| came out in ||July2013|| so pleeenty of time to get ||that cameo||
i dont remember if he was ever told or talked about it though. i think he did and he was <:TsubasaJoy:688191716620238870>
because of course ||he inspired them all|| whether because ||they wanted to fight along side him (Getter and other SRs)|| or ||hated him and wanted to subvert him (Gundam mostly <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> )||. i also love that among them was, at the time, the recent ||Pacific Rim Jaeger|| because the director mentioned that he was inspired ||by MazingerZ because he used to watch him when he was younger|| so full circle and wishes becoming true <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> .
yeeeeeeeeees <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328> <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328> <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>
just an offhand small summary that my brother found years ago because someone sorta explains what happens in the final. don't know the inbetweens but its more ||time travel/alter AU shenanigans|| because the end in Zero was ||not as happy as we thought it was|| because of course ||Zero is a bastard||.
And Boss Borot being MVP of course <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
Well that was the point. It was a sneak attack that they failed to kill the ONE guy they were suppose to kill. Otherwise the fight wouldve ended in like 5mins as we see in the end. Well maaaybe it couldve lasted a liiiittle longer if Koji wasnt so fucking RAEGMODO at the end because they done goofed <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
gotta remember that S1 is well S1 and with each passing season the animation gets better. also Toei <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@279341087494242304>  so much EEEEDGE. Note it has a prequel manga iirc but i dont remember if it was TL or not
Oh didnt know how many were still left. Thought it was more <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Also says it'll be 12 episodes <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

reading it right now and already that 1st volume is so much better than the OVA. much more goddamn info and backstory <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
looked up about the manga a bit. its called Mazinkaiser SKL Versus and its apparently both a prequel and sequel. its on MangaDex and fully TLed but in spanish. even shows when ||Scarlet, the red head captain, used to pilot the Wingle like a badass and used to put the 2 idiot pilots in their place when they were being idiots||
but hey at least its nice to see we get a new main female bot that isn't Aphrodite/Diana/Venus though her uuh "specific design choice" was questionable as hell <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> ...
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-17/the-tatami-galaxy-novel-gets-sequel-16-years-later/.160732
yeah in a way
Finished PreCure5GoGo. They ||SAVED CHRISTMAS! PRAISE!|| On that note, ||they didn't get some costume changing super forms. Just some fancy butterfly wings. Also finally the Cure5 getting a proper final boss fight after what happened last season. Bunbee living this long and turning good wasn't too surprising but WTF KAWARINO WAS FUCKING ALIVE?! HOW?! WHAT. THE. FUCK?! WHAT?! <:ChrisShock:620077681484103680> And he's also turned into a sorta lazy bum not listening to Bunbee lol||. For a while I thought ||Syrup was going to be the Director's son with Flora before he turned evil/lost his way or something but nope. It would've been good drama but oh well||. I liked their costume design change for the season. Rouge's transformation still being my favorite of the group because dynamic exploding fire <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>  with Aqua's being 2nd though Aqua and surprisingly Lemonade's attacks were my favs this time. The others were pretty good though. Mint ||getting a proper attack as an energy disk instead of the shield is good but kinda sad. That one time she used her shield attack in S1 as a super offensive move really left one hell of an impact of what she could've been capable of with it||. I was hoping ||they were going to get some new single attack moves with the Fleurets but nope|| and ||Milky Rose's Fleuret attack was just a shinier version of her regular one. Reminds me of how only Dream got a new animation attack for her Crystal Shoot in S1 but everyone else just did the exact same thing but just add the lil item. So lazy <:GarieOhYeah:688429715769262187>||. I miss the ||Cure 5 Explosion and its giant butterfly though||. Overall good season. Since I've seen the first 7 Cure series I'll probably continue in order and tackle Suite next at some point.
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-18/tokyo-revengers-manga-gets-tv-anime-in-2021/.160780
who is the evil mastermind behind such an evil video
started watching Suite PreCure. At ep.4 ||ALL THOSE TASTY TREATS AND I CAN'T HAVE ANY! WHY MUST YOU TORTURE ME SO <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>!|| Hummy ||being such an airhead trolling Siren <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>||. For now I like Kanade more than Hibiki though ||Hibiki was the reasonable one and put on her big girl pants. Her earlier complete unwillingness to communicate and just doing this kinda dickish attitude in the previous episodes irked me. Especially Ep.1 with
accusing Kanade of being better than her when she simply asked her to to have some goddamn manners and ASK for the cakes instead of STEALING them, being the first in calling their precious record as something useless and calling Kanade a deadweight after their first failed fight wooo that was something but at least she's already getting better thank God||. Good so far though.
think ill stop there for now and continue tomorrow
ep.10 ||Even Siren cannot resist Ouji-sama's princely charm, also GORILLA DANCE <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>!||. Ep.11 ||Masked Cure appears and Siren is nowhere to be seen. SUUUSPIIIICIIIIOUUUUS|| Ep.12 ||When you have perfectly good Cure candidates but obviously aren't. DAAAAAMN Tones just having no mercy on Hummy with them sick burns ouch <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>. Dammit Toei reusing an OBVIOUS 80's Mazinger Z sound effect again! It was used in PreCure5GoGo too and every time I hear it its the first thing that comes to mind <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>!! Ah road caution sign. Truly MVP hero. Giant flaming heart attacks gave me this weird image of mixing Sailor Moon and G Gundam. Take this! My love, my anger and all of my sorrow! HMMM pushing Siren=Masked Cure too much. You're not tricking me Toei <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>!||
doing a lil more Suite PreCur watching. ep.7 ||Otokichi is awesome old grandpa and his lil purse doll is cute. such good grandkids <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>|| ep.8 ||Sirens friend stealing plan backfiring by getting attached insteads though could it be foreshadowing perhaps? HMMMMMMMM||. starting ep9 ||"you get a Berthier and YOU get a Berthier! EVERYONE gets a Berthier!... except you <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> " Kanade - <:HibikiShock:336656371611074580>. Later when she does get the Berthier - does finisher move and just cutely walks offscreen with a giant explosion in the background like a boss <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>||.
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
oh forgot ||slight tune change in the OP (i think more strumming because Beat perhaps?) with some new scenes and new ED and dance <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>. Also liking how they mixed their transformations together and all of them posing in the FINALE attack||
think i'll leave it to here for the day. Suite so far has been fun
Ep.24 ||Sand sculptures and warm fuzzy hugs the episode <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>. Sorry Hummy but imagining everyone as you kinda backfires <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>. Also loving that the Fairy Tones are just chilling enjoying an ice cold drink while the girls are building their sculptures <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>. Sorry Hibiki no year supply of cupcakes for you. I would've wanted it too <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>. Ellen afraid of hermit crabs or specifically creepy moving shells. Adorable <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>. On that note ELLEN👏 BEST👏 GIRL👏||
Ep.23 ||Can't be a coincidence the Negatone looks like a giant yellow doll of CatSiren. EXCUSE ME she just strummed the lil hair sticking out of her head and it fucking rocks a tune! Badassery levels have gone through the roof wtf <:HibikiWow:614268629952757760>!! Lol Minor Trio puling a failed G Gundam Master Asia technique of the undefeated of the east <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>. Cure👏Beat👏Rocking👏Them👏Tunes👏 Fuck👏Yeah👏Let's👏Go👏! EXCUSE ME she just pushed her hair back and more rocking tunes came out. Why must she be so goddamn cool <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>!! Otokichi - "Tears make up the smallest sea." Later Ellen crying <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>||.
Ep.22 ||Aaaaw she can't turn into a cat or others anymore? It would've been funny for random things later on. At least Cure Beat brings some rocking tunes <:MariaSunglasses:336656798687690752>||
Ep.18 ||Otokichi badass gramps <:Germain:421434126856486912>. Also dammit Muse they probably could've finished the damn thing already but of course she works for Toei and can't let it end so easily <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>!|| Ep.19 ||Just give in already Siren. You know you want to eat those cupcakes. You can't resist <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>!|| Ep.20 ||When the Fairy Tones were smart but Hummy still hands them over <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>|| Ep.21 ||reminder from ep.19 i think - Masked Cure saying "Now if a NEW PreCure just so happened to be born". Ep21 happens and tadah <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. On that note I loved that she was so goddamn shocked that she ran away. Previous times its always "oh I'm a Cure time to save the day" and they take immediate action before leaving but here she was just so lost and confused as hell that she couldn't handle it at all. Also totally didn't tear up when Hummy was tearing up and then singing <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>!||
uuuuh isn't that pic nsfw <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ....
Ep.15 ||I want cupcakes! It's not fair <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>!!||. Ep.16 ||Kanade - "No!", Hummy - "No more paw for you then", Kanade - "<:HibikiShock:336656371611074580> ". Hibiki - "Never", Hummy "You get to eat cake", Hibiki - Let's do this shit <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>!". Hummy after manipulating them like a boss - <:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>  smug levels over 9000. How to beat the MotW? By following good old Ghostbuster logic, crossing the streams or more specifically crossing weapons <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>||. Ep.17 ||Emotional happy Hibiki and mama episode. I'm not crying <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>!||
continuing Suite PreCure. Ep.13 ||Yeah Siren being Masked Cure would've been too obvious. How generous of them to clear that up so soon <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> but oh look she used to be a good person and is being brainwashed. Time to plot that eventual future rescue||. Ep.14 ||good old classic evil doppleganger trick||.
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-06-20/healin-good-precure-anime-resumes-new-episodes-on-june-28-after-covid-19-delay/.160877
Little bit of Suite PreCure. Ep.25-29. Let us continue praising ||Cure👏 Beat👏 Best👏 Girl👏! Poor girl afraid of ghosts and so nervous on her first day of school but she's so adorable <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> . Ellen please don't take Hummy's advice so seriously. She's Hummy, even if she does mean well. Also Hummy please tell us more silly/adorable things about Ellen. I will give you cupcakes if you do <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>. Otokichi being an MVP granpa getting Ellen her school uniform and stuff and just being supportive <:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>. MinorTrio may have also gotten powered up but at least their still idiots <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>. Magical Girl/Hero problems - nothing like saving the world in 30mins and just BARELY making it home in time to save the cupcakes in the oven <:FineShocked:672430513025187840>. Also Adventuring with the Fairy Tones! Them helping Hibiki waking up on time and their little training montage and being tiny little badasses <:KirikaCheer:689614085402525830> but poor little guys working themselves nearly to death because they felt guilty/responsible for loosing the music notes <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>. Damn you Minor Trio for hurting my little fairy buddies <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>! When the evil guardian made Hummy cry and pissed off the Cures - Insert "Carol's 5 seconds to slaughter" here <:MillaarcSmile:672845884135833610>. The key to open the door was creepy but at least they have finally gotten the magical mcguffin artifact of magical power. Good job <:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>. And look at that, the "evil guardian" of the mcguffin uses those same ear covering noise producing things Minor King used on Minor Trio and Siren. HMMMMMMMMM foreshadowing perhaps? Who knows <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>||.
Or you can read Shin Getter inbetween Neo Getter for reasons iirc
<@279341087494242304>  The animes? Most are standalones or loosely based on source (just needing base info) so you can watch any. The exceptions being 80's Getter and its sequel Getter G. Neo v Shin Getter is a loose interpretation of Shin/Getter Mangas. Uuuh New Getter is probably the most complete adaption/interpretation taking several elements from the various manga arcs. Armageddon is Armageddon of course.
As for the Manga the order is Getter- Getter G- Shin Getter- Neo Getter(Getter Go)- Getter Arc.
Suite PreCure ep.30. We continue with more ||Cure👏 Beat👏 Best👏 Girl👏 . Though Nishijima is also really up there too. Hibiki just magically summoning her out of nowhere by whistling <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872> . When the mcguffin artifact tells you not to cheat <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164> and likes a little mischief by playing random sounds to make people smile <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>. Also Hummy being surprisingly sadistic showing Kanade and Ellen's perfectly blinding test scores... I probably would've done the same yeeeees <:MillaarcSmile:672845884135833610>. Otokichi being mysterious as ever <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>. Random MotW is random but then realizing how many MainCures or MCMagical Girls would've failed against it when you think about it <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>. Another surprising twist in a PreCure series, failing to use the mcguffin's finisher move. Good writing choice. Baddies getting blasted every other day yet they failed to name the attacks in the quiz. You fail as mooks <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>! And Melody doing everything possible to not let us see her test score <:Ver:704169051391524875>.||
Imagine Discotek getting the license and just releasing season boxsets
I like the one guy in the CR article saying that if you think Avengers was nuts just imagine a bunch of crossover magical girls ripping into a monster like a bunch of wolves <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
We cant have magical girls kicking ass in CQC ala DB and teaching the importance of friendship and believing in yourself and being good role models for young girls. Too violent for them or something... oh wait
And its kinda BS their choice to dumb it (PreCure) down for the kids when they intentionally also promote it for adult diehard fans (Figuarts and statues anyone)  and guess what fans in the west are the ones asking for it
Thats why i mean
In the old days that was common because old ways yeah but nowadays its a stupid decision to do and people/bigger fans are still asking for the uncut/unedited versions of the old shows even if their subbed only
And when they do they make the stupid decision to cut/edit when fans dont want that (Glitter Force anyone)
Their just not thinking the type of fan/market they have in the west, etc. If their concerned then they could have just streamed it. At least the hardcore fans already buy the merch
Its a weird mix of asking lots of money, license the whole thing or nothing, its a kids show but insist on editing it even though fans dont want that, not promoting enough or at all
And make stupid decisions
Though you also have the... canadian english dub of PCS1 iirc which they only changed the names and thats it iirc.
Because they want more money <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
To be fair CR does have Pretty Cure (S1). But yeah Toei just NOT licensing for west. Gotta INSIST on americanizing it (Glitter Force) or something cause idiots
Holy shit <:FineShocked:672430513025187840>
And its better. So much better <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
No no. Thats Kaiser v GGD. You also have the 80's Mazinger vs GGD
Oh and i guess Grendaizer v Great is sooorta canon. You could throw it somewhere inbetween Grendaizer
That moment when arguing with bro if Mazinger v GGD movie is/isnt canon when its obviously an ||extended/better version of the Mazinger ED|| <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980> <:CarolYandere:424047704826707980>
Really mostly just crossover fanservice
Asking bro uuh says movies are mostly all standalones but ud need to know who are the characters because retcon AUs.
Truthfully the Shin v Neo OVA was just meant to sell some mini short Dynamic Robot skits that were included with its release in JP (abd NOT in the US <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>) of the Dynamic SR fighting/joining forces just to introduce ||Mazinkaiser|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> ...
||Yes but one of his most heroic badass sacrifices ever|| and its more based ||from the manga||
Shin v Neo is only 4 episodes but that eps1 beginning is both <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328> and <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>
i'll leave it to here. hopefully i can finish tomorrow <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>... if no interruptions happen <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
aaaaand only now do I realize Hummy is dressed ||like a cupcake <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>||. Lol ||Dodory tattle-telling on Muse <:MariaChuckle:672465496515411984>||
Sorry Cure ||Muse|| but you're too soon in trying to pull Heartcatch PreCure Cure ||Flower||'s ||doppelganger technique||. "A" for effort though  <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>.
and the ||musical transformation earrings set is complete <:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>||
more about ep.37 ||THIS IS HALLOWEEN! THIS IS HALLOWEEN <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>!! How DARE these fools interrupt a Halloween Party. The Pumpkin King will visit them for their transgressions soon enough <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>!!||
to be fair ||Mephisto is as tall as Aphrodite|| too so probably the good old "people shrink when their old" trope <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
Ep37 ||The enemy is the NOISE. OK! Time to bring in the Gear Squad <:TsubasaAngry:692141154531016765><:ChrisDJ:690470897194369034><:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548><:MariaConfident:336657338729627658><:KirikaMad:688188152891834417><:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792><:MikuDelete:661660028410920990><:KanadeAngry:672861874966233118><:SerenaMunch:661660046370799697>!!|| Oh and ||Otokichi being confirmed as an obvious badass <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>|| Of course editting some more cause I hadnt finished the ep yet ||Mephisto such a silly doting Papa <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367> and Ako getting embarrassed <:MikuCute:672908542763859968>||
Ep.36 ||Happy family reunion <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>! Didn't expect that other guy to become the next big bad though <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>...||
Ep.35 ||WELL that happened <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>. Also love the fact the girls put 2 and 2 together with Beat remembering that important tidbit. Well she was dealing with a bunch of things and stress back then so I wont hold it toooo much against her <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. She's still best girl <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>||
Suite PreCure Ep.31-34 ||More Cure👏 Beat👏 Best👏 Girl👏 . Ah good old training montage leading to mastering the mcguffin technique of ultimate power <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>and more Otokichi giving Beat more books and her taking the info in them too far. So cute <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>. Open a little vending stall. Put VERY IMPORTANT items that are NOT for sale near or ON the stall and NOT put a "NOT FOR SALE,DISPLAY ONLY" sign on them. Have people constantly ask if its for sale. God I hate it when stores do that <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>. Oh look at that more Cure Muse and putting focus on Ako. HMMMMMMMM I WONDER WHY. AAAAAAAAND Muse done goof and he stole ALL THE NOTES. Goddammit Muse <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>||.
To be fair everyone in anime has "bad luck" when they always end up getting involved in something. Depends what number they roled in the dice <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
With that done taking a small break before tackling SmilePreCure next. Not only cause its next but because Suite PreCure told me so <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>.
Ep.48 ||<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>. Yay, Hummy was ok and everyone is safe. Hummy singing was lovely too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>. And Trio Minor missed you so much Seiren <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>. "<:KirikaWhat:671948299179130885>???!!!!"- this emote expressing just how Otokichi and Crescendo felt when they saw Pii-chan <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>||. See ||you can tell he's good cause he's fluffy white now <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>. I'm still watching you bird <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>||.

With that Suite PreCure is done. It was a fun watch overall. The beginning was rough but the journey through it all was worth it in the end and made it all the more worthwhile. BRAVO BRAVO 👏 👏 👏 !!  <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Ep.47 ||"Hummy have an errand to run." HUMMYYYYYY <:ShirabeCry:671887081026617345>!! "This world is one big suite." <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>. Fairy Tones! FUUUUUSION! Super PreCuuuuuure Crescendo Modo <:ElsaCharge:690470897559011328>! Noise has been defeated/saved PreCure style <:ElsaSmug:688429724443213903>.

The beginning of the episode was a bit of a whiplash. For a second I thought I had some episodes in the wrong order or something but then they showed the modules. And of course the evil little demon hellspawn let them go cause its a sadist <:ShirabeStare:582381430915596289>.  Well, it's not so little anymore <:ShirabeConcern:586404485598019604>. And so 4 new Heart G Clefs have been born and  a new melody begins. Onward <:Germain:421434126856486912>!||
Ep.43 ||Mephisto, Bassdrum, Baritone <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>. You evil EVIL bird <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>!||
Ep.42 ||Poor Bassdrum and Baritone. Stupid bird <:ShirabeMad:688188118087499792>||
Oh and finally we get the final OP version because too busy promoting the movie in the previous several episodes <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>.
Ep.41 ||When the whole world is 1 Note away from destruction and Fari, Fairy Tone that rivals Hummy in airheadedness, is the one holding it <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>. We all movie star heroes now! Fairy Tone Bunshin no Jutsu! Thank you Waon <:TomosatoSalute:688199574749446203>. Seika-senpai so cool <:KirikaSparkle:698939825876631714>! Ouji-sama and his knights coming in for the capture . Oof death by fanbase. Brutality <:MillaarcSmile:672845884135833610>. Fari please <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>.

Suite PreCure Ep38 ||Happy Birthday Otokichi <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>!! That chocolate looking cake looks delicious <:ShirabeDrool:688429716557791326>. I want it. Not fair <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>. On that note look at the cute little weird bird bonding with Muse. Such a cute weird bird... its the evil demon hellspawn and we gonna have sads and feels. Calling it now <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>||.
and that's that though i do hope that whole ||"getting tired after using the finisher ONCE"|| passes soon <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Ep.6 ||Team Assembled Party! Candy please... Miyuki's luck strikes again with a book to the face. Oh hey OP promoting the crossover movie. Hell yeah look at the old squads being such badass. Back to the show, Candy's bro is named Pop... Candy Pop... Cursed puns. Easily flustered when called cool and manly. A yes the secret code to the secret library, right, left open middle. Even bad guys like a good game of cards from time to time. Impossible code to crack! Peace sticking the landing. Yay  PreCure fairytale story time! Blahblah save the queen. Got it. JOKAH! Creepy Joker is creepy. This monogatari has only just started. Evil monsters, Bad End, revive queen but none of that matters! Gotta come up with a catchphrase! Priorities! That Akane/Nao and Miyuki/Yayoi synchronicity with Reika being the tie breaker by reasoning. FIVE PRECURE! Godammit Miyuki ending up int he South Pole- WTF ARE YOU DOING GOING OUTSIDE?! USE THE F*CKING BOOKCASE! Finally come up with a catchphrase. Perfect execution and pose! Get's blasted. Sasuga MotW. Aniki has transformation no jutsu. Turns into a giant pressing machine and goes sumo followed by holding the enemy down. OK. Pop is good onii-chan. Books - the new method of transportation. Aaaand Candy stomach ruining the emotional moment||.
Ep.5||When they actually do tell someone about the PreCure thing and ask them to join and believe them even though she's a bit skeptical until she sees the talking lifeform and rejects on account of responsibilities. Aaaw a cute montage of them working together to put the story stuff together... see Candy once again almost getting caught. Candy please. Rock, paper scissors! Everyone failing. Reika's inner rage at seeing the paper doll getting stepped/kicked on snapping her out of it. Proceeds to take charge and just Henshin! Cure Beauty! Just accepting and carefully analyzing the situation calmly and finds the real MotW no problem. So cool. So chill. I like the snowflake that pops up during her attack. With that the team has been assembled||.
Ep.4 ||Just casually remove those ribbons and uncurl some super long ears and then just bend them to make them look like bunny ears. Totally understandable Red Oni. Freshly clean/washed clothes are great. Bitchy students alert. Of course they listen to the handsome president. On that note, Nao-chan so coooool. Gets surrounded by fanclub. Ninja vanished when they cleared out. Teach us your ways Nao-sama. T-that's a lot of siblings. The rock paper scissor thing being something she does want to do and changing it being intentional and Red Oni and Candy just getting caught up in it. Sasuga Peace. DAAAAMN Nao's ball kick strong enough to make the MotW flinch/fall back. Henshin! Cure March!  Intense courage and she's the green PreCure. I see someone goes to the school of the King of Braves GGG. Oof too much intensity there March. Crashing into that wall. Magical soccer player recruitment success! I see Miyuki has bad luck with things hitting her in the face||.
Ep. 3||See Yayoi sketching, relatable character spotted. Hello Red Oni. Nice one putting the poor girl on the spot Akane/Miyuki and without consulting/asking her. I know what the staff was going for, their good girls, it's done with good intentions, Yayoi did want too but it irks me to no end when stuff like this happens. Huh one of the art students looks quite a lot like a shorter hair Tsubomi from Heartcatch. Yeah you better help her after nominating her without her permission. Candy please. Someone kindly and not so politely punch those art students. NOOOO HE CRUSHED THE POSTER! I LIKED THE POSTER! Aaaaand failed finishers. These girls really need to work on that spirit/focus. Yayoi snaps out of it, guesses Happy is Miyuki, Miyuki panics and exposes identity yet again. Miyuki please. Inner rage awakened! Henshin! Cure Peace! Hair makes bubble POOF noise. Rock, Paper, Scissors! Cool pose against her opponent... NOPE'D hard. I see someone may have learned Sailor Moon's "crying will unleash secret attack" technique. Casually mentioning Peace power is lightning. Sasuga Candy. PreCure Peace Thunder! Peace should take some lessons from Sailor Jupiter or Great Mazinger about thunder attacks. Oh wow went back to check but just noticed that the main character starting the ED dance changes to one of the others. Nice touch||.
Ep.2 ||Miyuki and Candy on the same happy smile wavelength. That is one giant strawberry. Where's the chocolate for it? I'd be worried if it was just Miyuki only too Candy. Huh, for being the baddies world its fairly picturesque and I like it. Ultimate sports technique! Ball to the face! Hino likes volleyball? She should watch Haikyu!!. Sneaky bush sneaks. Scolds Miyuki to hide the PreCure thing. Proceeds to almost expose herself. Candy Please. Still, what would be the chances that the 2 people Miyuki went to first could EVER become PreCures. Impossible right? Well Miyuki, nearly getting yourself killed falling was one way to help Akane get her mind off of things. Oh hi creepy clown face, we meet again. I see Happy is going for the most failed Finisher Moves. Just realized Akane has X hair pins. Perhaps she and Kirka exchange styling tips. Henshin! Cure Sunny! Yes set the powder thing ON FIRE with a snap of your fingers. And exploding hair too. Hot bloodedness is not complete without an exploding fiery BG. Never leave home without it. That self awareness of her own Chunni and then embraces it after getting complimented. See all that volleyball training truly paying off. Look at that burning spike go||.
Ep.1 ||OP - Smile! Smile! Smile!  Ah yes Miyuki, the old mysterious destined encounter at the corner. A classic trope indeed. Weren't expecting a flying book and a fairy slamming into your face though did ya. Nice to meet you Candy. You got some big shoes to fill after the great fairy companions Hummy and the Fairy Tones (and a few others in from other seasons). Hello everyone's good friend, the internal panicking self. Hello obvious color coded future PreCures. Ah yes when you unintentionally open a magic portal not once but twice and go from a magical place to the middle of town. A lamb and Wolf. First thing that came to mind was the Ringing Bell movie. What a waste of perfectly good black paint. Bad wolf! Henshin! Cure Happy! Well I guess Miyuki has the most realistic terrified reaction when she realized she transformed and was informed to fight. NOPE'd so hard. Why must the MotW have a creepy clown face. And first time someone failing their first finisher move on the first try. You need MORE SPIRIT and GUTS!  Smile - "So tired". Candy - "Oh yeah it useless a lot of energy". ORLY? ED - Let's go! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! The little scenes in the background monitor are amusing||.
started up Smile PreCure. Sadly the place i was normally watching PreCure only had the Dub Version. Just <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>. Luckily found it somewhere else. Streaming is laggy tho for some reason so this might take a while. Saw the first 6 eps. (oh and out of curiosity i saw the first minutes of the dub afterwards. Spoilers and cringe. Just <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097>). Anyways reactions cause why not.

But i know what you mean. I liked the beginning but the ending... hmmm been a long time since i saw it but i guess i didnt care for it much? Needed more something i guess... No Getter ending tops Armageddon ending to me and probably never will anyways <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Mostly Getter, Shin and Arc stories and uuh maybe Neo/Go. I know it was the first time they used stuff/plot from Arc in any getter anime adaption iirc
It was pretty much a retelling of the getter manga plot while taking some liberties and mixing elements from each story arc (ex.  Benkei in New Getter mixes Benkei and Musashi's name, Benkei Musashibou, but his appereance is Baku from Arc). And as for what it was trying to do in the end, something something ||multiverse, space-time, time travel, parallel world shenanigans and the true form of getter rays and Ryoma|| or some such.
but not a focus... until much much later in GGG novel/manga sequel
and of course some characters from Betterman are related to ones in GGG too
as wiki puts it action/horror/mecha. maybe slap some mystery/suspense in it too. spin-off series that takes place in the same universe/timeline as GaoGaiGar (which is hotblood/mecha/adventure/awesome). you don't need to see one to see the other though later GaoGaiGar materials either references stuff from Betterman and eventually have them intersect/join GGG
iv seen it but in EN. man that brings back memories <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

Mentioned in the interview materials for the movie and you can read them in the Wiki iirc
Its true
CardCaptor Sakura <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Homura should have learned from Hibiki. She did a better job of ||bringing down God and winning all the things|| <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
NO! Its Entropy <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Homura <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Ah yes talk. Talk to the one motherfucker why doesnt she <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Speaking of i need to finish Thunderbolt Fantasy <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Besides its still Homura's fault because she ||didnt destroy the shield and told Kyubey everything about Madoka and the old world instead of keeping her mouth shut about it|| <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Besides what's going to happen when Madoka has to ||"grow old and die" in this new world? Reset endlessly?||
She did alter it. Madoka is now ||the "new transfer student from out of city who doesnt know anybody instead of Homura. And Homura is the reliable senpai||
Yeah and manga and AUs show she can react better
Besides Homura didnt just ||give Madoka a "normal life" but she also altered her and Sayaka's history to separate her from Sayaka||
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Yeah ||dont throw soul gems over bridges||
Also yes that little idea from Madoka mom. Do something wrong to do things right or whatever. Remember Madoka's first little impulse afterwards was ||throwing Sayaka's gem over a bridge|| iirc. how did that turn out <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
No one is against her trying to ||give Madoka a normal life again or protect her agaibst Kyubey|| but you cant expect shit to not hit the fan for her little stunt.
And "better" is questionable because we only see the "good aftermath". We still dont know the consequences for it. One of is still || that the world is unstable and Madoka trying to go back into GoddessMode||
Except its now ||Madoka may not have been happy but she wasnt goibg to turn her back on her choice. Homura is now shouldering everything and doesnt care/trust anyone. She will destroy everything if necessary||
Considering the concept hinted other ||magical girls coming to help?|| i guess that could tie in with Magia Record somehow or something <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
Yeah and still no ||"WarGod Mami"|| or whatever idea they had going <:CarolPout:617039564313198602>
the weird part of anime again <:ChrisRead:688429724334161987>
Symphogear is just ||another reset|| after magical girl #1365324677 got her turn <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
The wonders of lack of communication and trust and other things <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Homura may love them but she doesnt trust them enough. Enough to ||have them kill her|| but not enough to tell them the truth that ||she did it to stop kyubey from taking Madoka and giving her a proper normal life because she shouldnt have to be locked up in eternity||
<:TsubasaNote:689554460044820608>

Nobody knows <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
Yeah they just upped the animation/etc in the recap movies. Plus they cut early stuff anyways (removed the OP sequence and sacrificed Mami interaction time iirc). mm the only thing you could probably watch is the ED credits for the 2nd Movie for a "hint" of sorts
All hand crafted stuff i believe
Specifically those crazy witch/nightmare style BG was made by 1-2 people iirc not shaft related. Uuuh Inu Curry i think they were called iirc... yeah Gekidan Inu Curry
But keep watching the movie <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
If you want post-world/pre-rebellion you'd have to read the Rebellion manga

<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
I guess Nanoha could be considered "dark" if you just focused on the backstory stuff cause its pretty depressing/sad/rage induncing buts its mostly a hopeful/happy show
oh and dont forget the "concept movie trailer" AFTER you see the Rebellion Movie so you can suffer like the rest of us <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

yes probably <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
id say its great and all but it would've been better if it didn't exist than having an "open end" and implying a sequel to it that we still don't have <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
YT
the author was gonna go for a regular ending until SOMEBODY suggested what we got instead
we were SUPPOSE to get a sequel but nothing
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
needs more fist fights and chair throwing
Madoka ||doesn't need to be invited. she has an all-access vip pass to all soul gems becuase of her wish. Homura just happens to have a loophole card and steals Madoka's card||
||yes. how else do you think she got in the first place?||
even Homura later realized ||Bebe's presence made no sense and recognized her form||
possiblity is ||Madoka powers were used to manipulate Mami into thinking she knew Bebe and she says she knows her and Homura just takes it at face value||
well ||cause Sayaka/Bebe/Madoka knew Kyubey was up to his old shit again and were just observing the experiment too and waiting for the right time to rescue Homura||
||Well Bebe does say she has some foggy recollection of Mami. probably because she realizes she killed her when she was a witch. saw a lonely person and didn't want to leave them alone||
||sayaka also didn't forget. something something both Bebe and Sayaka carrying Madoka's power/memories so Madoka could stay low/hidden or something because that's how the Law of Cycles normally works or something||
Also Dancouga BD Set - TV Series+2 OVAs. And BD A Thousand and One Nights

Madoka's ||system worked fine. the thing is that the Witch System produced far larger and more quickly but brought greater despair and suffering while Madoka's, though it produced slightly less, was a compromise . of course Kyubey would want the bigger/faster method||
BAM 4th movie plot <:TikiPraise:672430544381935625>
I just had a crazy thought. Since ||Homura brought down the human half of Madoka. Could this Madoka make another wish?||
On other hand if Homura ||had gone with Madoka then she wouldve become her ultimate archangel, wouldve gotten infinite time powers and whatever other crazy godly abilities and Kyubey would probably never get her anyways||
Hell ||her familiars are throwing tomatoes at her because "stop fucking lying and acting all evil bitch"||
Id be more ok if she just said so to Sayaka and the others or something like ||"What i took was her human half. The Cycle is still in place. I did it because Madoka deserved to be with her family and friends like everybody else and not be dammed for all eternity like some sacrificial lamb for you hypocritical bastards who think that was "right". Kyubey was also aware of her now. How long do you think it will be before he catches her and starts the witch cycle again? Do you think you can come up with something better? Go ahead. Until then you get this.||

managed to hear the tail end of the stream during the question/ask. regarding shows they have that are DVD only. they would like to make SD-BD releases but their hands are full with just all the new stuff they keep getting. so i guess a Mazinger Z BD set wouldn't be out of the question per say.

im finding it funny that its Maria as Yoh against Kanade's Hao (and if Yui and Nana were to reprise their roles then Maria will fight Serena and Basa is watching her girl marrying someone else <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> )
looking at the list now. oh snap your right
if Maria is Yoh now and Kanade reprises Hao then whose the 3rd Gear VA?
lol
and Kamina <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
shit didn't know Amidamaru's VA was Volfogg in GaoGaiGar, and that was his debut role <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
for the ones who cant moonrune
Yoh: Yoko Hikasa
Amidamaru: Katsuyuki Konishi

mentions GaoGaiGar but not all the other Braves. they deserve love too. mostly J-Decker <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
and if you don't want giant robots fighting it out in mortal combat then i could suggest Iron Leaguer for tiny robots duking it out in mortal combat... in hotblooded SPORTS <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
and then the big fight. throw all the things. im still trying to figure out how the hell my brother managed to spot this one very specific monster that only pops up for like a split second in the corner <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
still seeing some image/scenes from the old 80's show redrawn in the opening was nice.
all Braves are standalone except GaoGaiGar Fina which is a direct sequel to GaoGaiGar. Diebuster could be watched without Gunbuster but then you'd miss out on the hints so better watch Gunbuster beforehand. All Getters, except the 80's TV shows/movies, are standalones. All Mazingers, except the 80s shows/movies, are standalones. however some of Getter and Mazinger work under the impression of having basic knowledge of the franchise. the recent Mazinger Infinity Movie acts as an alternate sequel to the old 80's tv show.
ask away
but yeah finding out that Betterman was connected to GGG was something <:ElsaWhat:689195325621141505>
i hear Gear Fighter Dendoh was sorta also a spiritual Brave successor
well read the available manga chapters in mangadex and im liking it so far
RIP GGG/GGGFinal anime sequel which we getting in the shape of a novel and manga
some saying that that even supposedly affected the ending of Might Gaine which was <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
eventually they became their own thing of course. especially when Takara and Sunrise had their falling out
when Transformers was dying out/loosing popularity they made the Braves to sorta keep it going. Exkaiser, the first Brave, actually reuses designs from some Transformers.
yes
all Braves are good in their own way. its just their mileage may vary but id say J-Decker and GaoGaiGar stick out most.
its just there is one other Brave show, Goldran, that had the hilarious ep of one of the MC giant bots becoming a dad. literally <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
<@!149704282793443328> yes that's the one
yes thats the one
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
what? j-decker? think you're confusing with Goldran
well Shadowmaru is proto-volfogg anyways
im still mad that supposedly the MC child was changed from being a girl to a boy. not sure how true that was though
J-Decker is good. i love my precious police robo cop children <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> if any harm comes to them there will be hell to pay <:ShemHaWhat:727010581722431499>
i think Da-Garn was another good one... cant remember. if you something more sentai-ish you have Dagwon
You got OG1977Yatterman, the remakes 08Yatterman and Yatterman Night. Saw Night. It was interesting/good iirc

oh and the cat monster whose name i dont remember but my brothers reminded me he existed and he got revamped
Anguirus and Jet Jaguar. But more importantly Anguirus. FINALLY he gets some love. now if this turns out to be done well 👀
Yeah the movies are their own continuity. S1 and 1st Movie are somewhat interchangeable. from there you either go for A's(S2) > StrikerS(s3) and 2nd Movie > Detonation > Reflection. on the other hand you can also watch S1>S2>S3 and then the Movies because metawise the Movies are propaganda in the Series <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yes and it was for psp <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
yeah its like... its so simple/ordinary. i feel like i could've seen it before but nothing comes to mind. and i cant find anything else either. you could find a character with one of the 2 things (either the ponytail or side ponytail or the side hairstyle) but not both <:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>

she just has a ponytail on the back and some drill/curly/whatever loose hair on the side and thats it


whose the character btw
https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2020-10-26/netflix-reveals-spriggan-anime-series-new-teaser-trailer/.165629

oh hey comments mention the guy who plays as him in the live action version is gonna voice him in the anime too 👀 ?
apparently the level in which each one of those people got befriended by Nanoha laser.
and is a perfect Grade A graduate student in the art of befriending.
Bikki went to the School of Nanoha <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
... no <:YumiStare:688429724065988721> ...
Really wish i was on pc for better clarity <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
And some other screenshots cause why not

Yeah yeah. Brain derp <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Ok sorry. Bro confused here and so was i. Manda is the serpent dragon, Ebirah crab. Kamakura mantis
From the short pv.
He did see Ebirah. The lobster monster
Bro says manda is the mantis. There was no mantis
Rodan used to be a pair in the old movie (or three cant remember) a male and female. So they killed them so they wouldnt reproduce
Besides it would fit with the old story that Rodan wasnt only 1
You got a giant cat monster thing and a mutating whale with arms/legs in the process. Birds mutating into large armored pterodactyls would be normal <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
So you either have ancient hidden world where the mist is also locked in with surviving prehistoric creatures, they pulled a jurassic park and cloned them or mutating birds by red mist
Now i just need Mothra <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
Oh and we see a horde of birds covered in the red mist so im guessing a giant flock of rodans <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
People think the giant "whale" is either godzilla or titanosaurus during mutation process. On the other hand the japanese painting shown for a split moment shows a black colored fish going through mutation in the red liquid so it could be depicting godzilla so godzilla could already be around
Obviously the weird red mist/water is mutating them
You got overhauled catmonster, anguirus, rodan some people say Titanosaurus and Jet Jaguar
Somebody fucking license ZERO so i can have it dammit <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
It is <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Its not just an honor that Pacific Rim got cameo in Mazinger ZERO but pretty much a dream come true since the Director Guillermo admited he was inspired by several things like Iron Giant but also Mazinger because he used to watch it when he was a kid. I think people showed him/told him about the cameo. He <:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
Or flock of rodan with the 2-horn is the alpha
such a big franchise it has to have its own category <:YumiPoint:688429724103344164>
they didnt touch any of the other streaming sites either (wakanim and cant remember the other)
other shows also added. dates as follows
 The titles will launch on consecutive Fridays in November:

i liked StrikerS too
Well ShinvsNeo "adapted Go/Shin" and did its own thing entirely so i wouldnt be surprised if they did
But hey they insisted on constantly making alternate adaptions and now just skip all that and go straight to Ark <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Easily S1 couldve been Getter/G. S2 is Go (with Shin in the middle). S3 is Ark
<@259212156396896272> it be interesting if they made a Getter Zan anime or at least a manga about them. Never stopped them from making the other hundred alter timelines. Weird that they havent already. Oh or maybe could make a Mazinger Angels anime and have the Getter Zan team be in the same universe maybe. Thinking about it that was a missed opportunity in the manga. Give ALL the dynamic girls some spotlight <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
And now i go sleep or try to.  Goodnight <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Anyways hope its not too short. Armageddon and New Getter were OVAs so maybe itll be 13 eps like them. Then again ShinvsNeo was 4eps
<:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Or more specifically the real Shin Dragon
They used his Daikessen version
Aaaw dont pick on the poor Shin Dragon... even if I agree with you <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
The animation reminds me of New Getter though they use Heats from Armageddon as the promo song. Inb4 sequel to New Getter. Could probably work. Or just actually adapt the thing. Either way Hype Hype More Getter Hype Gimme <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
believe in the getter rays! they will answer someday <:Germain:421434126856486912>
hopefully <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
on the one hand. after 10k years its finally happening! HYPE HYPE HYPE <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>! on the other hand i am worried about that CGI. also them literally skipping ALL of the previous Getter story arcs that were never fully adapted aaand wondering what they'll do for the ending <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>

from the wiki. "The film is set in a parallel world, which took place after the Three Kingdom's Era arc."
looking a bit its just good old fashion cameo shenanigans apparently
well to be fair arent both inazuma eleven and danball senki animes based on video games belonging/made by Level 5. it might not be just a coincidence
we got Layton vs Phoenix Wright so im not gonna question weird shenanigans. its just rule of cool

Cure White/Black will always be top tier Cures <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
plus its the first PreCure series so not surprising its a little rough with its format
dont worry it eventually picks up. primary focus early on is working on their friendship/teamwork for obvious reasons that they were never friends/etc and they have no fight experience not to mention how their transformation gimmick works iirc. been a long time since i watched Futari Wa

but yeah Amazon had exclusive rights to ANY anime from the noitaminA anime block
anything that couldve been a possible Sentai license (or others) back then was taken by Amazon because of their co-op cause Sentai falling on hard times (Funi/CR having their co-op back then). timeskip Sentai was probably doing better financially, licensing stuff, opened HIDIVE and slowly/surely began to move stuff there instead
dont remember but i think amazon getting UmaruS2 was back when Sentai was going through hard times iirc
Land of the Lustrous was one too
ah Made in Abyss too
let's see.. i have a list of anime here.. old so idk if their still exclusive to Amazon or not uuuh let's see... Happy Sugar Life, Magical Girl Site, Wotakoi, Banana Fish, Dororo, Killing Bites, Umaru-chan S2, etc etc
yeah
and Yuki Yuna S2
those are just some of the other problems <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
cause of the Sony buy <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
i mean yes both Funi and CR are primarily US companies so priority streams to that but at least CR TRIED AND DID license to other regions (mostly applies to new streams. cataloged shows rarely if never did). Funi i think has maaaybe gotten better at it maybe? then again it doesnt matter with them now having Wakanim and AnimeLab... and now CR
and then there was the thing with them expanding to other regions but when they licensed shows they didnt get the streaming rights for X region
the problem with Funi was that at one point they were getting GLOBAL licenses for shows when they as a company were limited to US
it was hell of stupid. that Strike thing was US ONLY. anywhere else you only needed Amazon Prime
ok quick check to make sure but yes the exclusive rights that amazn had for Noitamina and nimeism had expired hence why other people are getting the animes now
remember Amazon trying to pull a DOUBLE PAYWALL for anime <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
so yeah it as a very very dark time for official stream and a bountiful harvest for yar har. cause if you think CR and Funi were bad then you have never seen Amazon Prime <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
oh an Inuyashiki
i think Amazon also had Kabaneri of the Iron Fortress too
hidive is sentais streaming platform
well he is a very good role model after all <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>

Dont worry. Anything important in Madoka gets explained at some point. The only thing that never got explored in anime was the Mami/Kyoko relation.

most romantic shit i have ever seen <:HibikiGay:670494484701773845>
i was looking forward to goldy pond arc goddammit <:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>
because dumb stupid decisions. idk. really the Goldy Pond arc is great. its certain stuff afterwards with the following arcs that people have issues with. at the very least you would think they would adapt that and then go original afterwards but nooooo
im hearing their not only skipping a whole damn arc (which is the ONE arc everyone was looking forward too) but because of that CERTAIN characters that people wanted to specifically see have also been removed. their going full original for S2
Yes. I think its mentioned in the description of the official trailer iirc. Well one thing is mentioning and another thibg is if it becomes reality  <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Zero was made before Frontier right? So that might explain the connection too
And Zero was just meant to showcase more stuff about the ||Ancients|| on Earth pre-Macross event considering what happened to Earth during Macross so thats "lost history" <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Ah thanks i always forget where Plus goes
And put Plus inbetween somewhere too
Because Zero > Macross > 7 > Frontier timeline or something like that
Macross Zero is pretty bad. Its not mysticism but ||lost advance alien|| stuff. And the thing is it ties in to Frontier background slightly.

big family <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> and dont forget the dogs <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
bros watch anime so they wouldn't care what id see (they dont watch as much as me but its their fault im into anime anyways). if anyone is watching something in the living room then anyone else who passes by ends up watching too if they want. dad and sister would be the dicks that be "blahblah waaaah why u watch dis stuf watch something else". mom liked a couple of Studio Ghibli films that i was watching in the living room and doesnt mind anime/cartoons/etc. im sure i could watch some anime/movies with her but probably avoid any fanservice/graphic stuff. so yeah variety in this household
if i go further backi was exposed much earlier without realizing it. like bro watching some old recorded episodes of Mazinger Z and Voltron and such and him telling me more about them (he had more episodes recorded... which sis recorded over them with a goddamn shitty soap drama 🗡️ <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> ) and forcing my parent sot rent My neighbor Totoro. you wont buy it for me? then ill make you rent it till its gone <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> !
and then pokemon and digimon <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
whenever bro got me addicted to Sailor moon <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
8 i think
fair. dont worry. my first exposure to parasyte was when i was kid and a manga magazine that my sister got me (in her dumb glory. cause it had sailor moon n it) had the 1st chapter in it and well tiny little brain of mind just <:HibikiShock:726645026725167114> i kept trying to carefully skip the pages each time i opened it. my love of moon was stronger than any fear. many years later when i got older and saw the old Borders bookstore (<:KirikaCry:674720015047720961> ) brought the volumes i decided to finally read the full thing. ended up loving it. then years after that came the anime and watched it too.
parasyte... been a while since i watched it but i dont think it was too gory. yeah sure bloodbath here and there but eventually it cuts down? need to rewatch <:MikuWorry:672908523495227432>
haikyuu is good culture!
watch Ushio and Tora <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158> !
you made your 7yr old cousin watch parasyte. well it is good culture <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Gunbuster and Diebuster are both good <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594> <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>

Oh god artbook 👀 👀  oh wait its only part 1 though. Discotek has both part 1 and 2 and so much extras. I think it brought everything the old dvd singles had
I still have tge tokyopop manga boxsets (3 volume box including art booklet and mini comics). Shouldve considered getting the Dark Horse Omnibuses. The new Hardcover books are cool... but their expensive as f*ck

i hear they also removed/edited dialogue from that too
well if MC explains it herself and reflects that such actions were wrong and changes her ways to reflect that then i dont see a reason to remove it because important character development and respecting people
anyone who read the fan TL could probably help better with this
according to the article MC does explain and reflects that her actions were wrong, she feels guilty and changes her ways or something

regarding Utena. its by Kunihiko Ikuhara, aka Mawaru Penguindrum, Yurikuma Arashi and Sarazanmai. He was for a time co-director of the OG Sailor Moon anime (from S2-S4 while also doing stuff back in S1 and was director for the movie SMR) and (according to the wiki) unhappy with not getting enough creative freedom with it he went and made/directed Utena. Utena is a classic god tier but lots of visual metaphors happening all over the place cause Kunihiko. also Yuri.

he got karma'd when he said "taxes are easy to do i can do them myself just fine no prob" iirc
yeah and people who accidentally fuck up do exist too.
i thought it was said he wasn't necessarily evading but that he fucked up his numbers (think he mentioned he did his own taxes) and well the law is still law and ya gotta pay/do the time
or suffering from hiatusness. i don't know. i haven't kept up/checked <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
now all the sequels he made for SK afterwards yeah those i think got cancelled
and now years later we finally getting the giant omnibuses <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
and instead of publishing those last chapters in regular manga volumes to finish the old print run they decided to just re-release it all in the giant fancy omnibus volumes and not finish the original manga run... which fucked up the US release which was the original manga volumes. i should know... i have them all <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
it wasnt cancelled but that the author went in a 10year hiatus <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> he did eventually come back and finished it

That or Walpurgis has NOTHING to do with Movie4 and the trailer is just symbolism cause Walpurgis represented the ||tragic eternal stage of MGs|| and were going back to more Meguca suffering
<:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Madoka the Movie 4 ||Homura/Consequences||
My theory is ||Madoka made MGs/Witches happy. Homu took a piece leaving Godoka incomplete and left a "hole" where it should never exist... again. Walpurgis is back for vengeance and ooh boy she has infinity power now||
someone quick. since its been what 8 years since Madoka Rebellion, how many ||timelines|| would that be? <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

now quick post the one with subaru from nanoha with the gaogaigar transformation edit <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
ok that Maple story vid was making so much gaogaigar callbacking <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!740195087895756820> letting you know watching the godzilla sp eps. finished ep.3. Jet Jaguar <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>  also Pops you crazy old man <:YumiStare:688429724065988721> ill probably try finishing tomorrow <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!740195087895756820>  oh also when ||jet jaguar "stopped responding/died" when Pops fell out and Rodan pecked at him and when he realized he wasn't moving anymore and he starts boasting. i can hear the obnoxious starscream "jet jaguar has fallen! i RODAN am the new king!" biiiiiiiiiiiitch <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>||
add him to the list of crazy awesome old people <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
i thought it was agreed that if you were gonna watch the OG Gundam that you should watch the compilation films and only watch the TV Show for "historical purposes" <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<@!740195087895756820>  continuing my watch of Godzilla SP ||ANGUIRUS NOOOOO! GODDAMMIT! LOOK AT HIM ROLLING JET JAGUAR LIKE A TOY. HE WAS A GOOD SMART BOY YOU FUCKS <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>!! He really does remind me of my own dog <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>. Also Aquatic Godzilla being a smug little shit by showing off his aquatic parkouring skills by jumping over a boat. Show off <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>||
oooh fuck ||ashihara was alive all along fuck. dumbfucks what are you doing. goddammit now i gotta wait for S2 <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>||
oh wait we getting a 2nd season? oh shit there was ||extra in the last ep credit. fuck didn't know. oooh shit mechagodzilla. goddammit this nutjobs. well that whole plot with the bones really didn't get thrown to the side/forgotten after all. fuck <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> ||
i liked it. i am a little disappointed that ||anguirus horn didn't amount to much besides a cool lance. i was expecting it would play some bigger role|| also that change to 2d animation for certain shots/scenes/fights during the last episode. kinda wish we had more of it early on. also all that science/philosophy. thank god i watch enough anime/movies to paraphrase it to ||space and time travel shenanigans being involved in this|| <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
<@!740195087895756820>  just finished Godzilla SP ||well guess we did SORTA get a Mothra reference with the horde of moths. heh "symbol of war/battle" <:Germain:421434126856486912> . JET JAGUAR! PERO-2 <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961>!! and oh god my poor brain from all this philosophy and whatnot. of course it was the damn song all along<:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>||
Your wallet will scream either way <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
you can always try looking up to see if you have any "small cons" around. iv gone to the local "big con" here which yeah it was expensive (both trip and the ticket.. and of course the shopping lol) but i went to some small ones. nothing fancy. small venues (one was even at a school. one happened at my local mall). entrances tend to be cheap (or free). they were small but fun... and still much money spent <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> its been a while though now my mall has an anime store so i aint complaining (shit i keep forgetting if he could get some Gear merch and he still hasnt stocked the Anime colored Sailor Jupiter Figuart. I neeed it <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>)

Dammit dont have that one doujin image of Emperor galaxy sized fighting angel gods or whatever <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Shhhh no physics and science. Only brrrrrr
TTGL Spiral is still the same as Getter Rays. Its not good either. Both are eldritch horrors but they dont deny people from fighting fate. Its how they like their living organism. Defy everything even if it still ends bad and all that
You saw nothing <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Technically you could also read Shin inbetween Go
<:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
No. Shin and then Go and lastly Arc
same but gotta remember most early opinions was based on the promo art. plus since it was a magical girl show one would wonder how far they would go. either maybe touch on some themes but not much/not go far or stay normal and just have fancy art direction.
and to be fair the first 3 episodes were mostly just info dumping and "regular magical girl" fighting/friendship building until the end of ep3. at least for me i agree that the atmosphere was too off putting and i was wondering when the ball would drop if it ever did

all it mentions is that they were both just close friends (even going to her concerts) but that doesn't mean they had a romantic relationship. he had depression and just tragic stuff happens. also uuh didnt know she was hated? that's new. then again i dont keep up with VA backgrounds so <:MikuShrug:689743224855724095>
that i know of no? never heard that
Basara is his own tier <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
👀
Also that uuh surprise that ||Hayato was engaged. RIP and poor Hayato in the end. He had to stay.|| <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Yeah. But hey at least he gets better iirc (been a while since i read it) cause of Sho <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Yeah he was. The fact i saw armageddon before reading Go (cause it wasnt or still being tled) was sorta whiplash cause he's obviously toned down in the anime and he gets better <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

demon slayer also has a pair of loving siblings that learn to kick ass to protect each other with no goddamn incest tones and of course best boi inosuke (and i guess some other nice/cool characters with little to no pervy fanservice). what else do you need. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720> (well maybe some less crying/cowardly zenitsu would've been better <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>)

the "concept trailer" is a concept trailer for a possible "4th movie". dont watch that until after you see Movie 3 - Rebellion. though we dont know if they'll use any ideas from it since they announced Movie 4 - Walpurgisnacht Rising recently but its a neat thing to watch

Iirc she ||described them as wild and hard to use but it wasnt that she "didnt/couldnt/etc want to" but that it didnt "feel right". Like they "didnt belong to her"|| or something. You know them ||spiritual feels|| <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
You would think they wouldve idk shown ||in the WaSuYu final credits a Taisha (probably Aki) giving a ceremonial box (maybe with the 3 circle symbol on it in a corner) to Karin or something||. iirc extra materials mentioning ||Karin can summon the sword-axes and doesnt feel right using them|| <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
But they did show/hint/explain ||why sonoko got better though? We knew she was an "unnamed" Hero who went Mankai a lot. The  heros get their offerings back so naturally she does too. She is shown briefly at the end of S1 with the last bandage falling off||. It was a matter of if they continued the show ||when was she was joining the party||. And we did get ||emotional crying reunion with Washi, Karin freaking out and Sonoko mention she's the hero who fought in x fight||. They animated WaSuYu so i guess its implied they all talk about it slightly offscreen. Now them not hinting ||Karin's terminal is Gin's is a travesty||.
To be fair ||they technically didnt get them back. Shinju gave them replacements cause God but it couldnt give back the originals||. Its not covered in anime but extra materials ||has them suffering "phantom pains/sensations" iirc||
YuYuYu having a disabled magical girl who used said magics to help with said disability ||though temporary i know|| to kick ass and take names was an amazing thing

the good thing about the extended stuff from the live was ||the inner thoughts each of them had during all the events of the final, the extended togo/sonochi visit to gin's grave, itsuki becoming the new club pres and the newly added 6th tenent||
yeah YuYuYu S2 was picked up by Amazon and was stuck behind a paywall <:KirikaDisgust:688431636043268097> timeskip to now the licenses expired all around and now Sentai has it all
yeah Pony Canyon were stingy with YuYuYu. i guess maybe the 1st season didnt sell well? they didnt license the rest anyways iirc. well you could always hope for Sentai/HIDIVE to sub them someday though doubtful
nothing like hearing sonochi saying ||god is dead|| <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

hmm says Hasui directed season 2 ep.6
according to comments. Tachikawa is still Chief Director (article says he's gonna be the executive director) and will supervise Hasui who did direct some Mob Eps. in previous seasons

speaking of YuYuYu did you watch that Live Matsuri "extended" ep13 thing yet 👀
reminder that ||all food, water etc was given to the people by shinju. there was no resource problems thanks to the shinju. now that it died they lost their infinite resource. they now have to rely on their wit/skills, what they have left and a giant oil reserve supposedly made from the shinju's dead corpse||
nah. they were talking about ||what to do in a world without the Shinju cause it "died"||
i havent started S3 yet so i cant say about timeline shenanigans yet
for the record ||some members of the Taisha did survive (you see some of them standing in the golden field meaning they chose not to do/complete the ritual). Aki-Sensei being one of them, though she lost one eye. Karin's older brother is possibly another||

Nah just talk about the movie. That their obviously skipping floors

the fact Betterman is in the same universe as GaoGaiGar still shocks <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
Ah yes the Venuses <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
What also sucked in KaiservGGD was introducing the Mazin Army. I was just "i know the twins from the OVA but who are these other bozos <:YumiStare:688429724065988721> " oh and speaking of the twins and Prof.Morimori <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
Jokes on him. Dr. Hell already did that and then some to the US president 🤣
... goddammit now i can see it too <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Devilman (and its sequels/whatever) isnt something that can be adapted due to their heavy themes etc. (Freaking Violence Jack is banned in several parts of the world iirc lol) Getting Devilman Crybaby was one hell of a happy surprise. But if Go Nagai can he will gladly shove Devilman in other works
Also SMZero was being published at the same time as Shin Mazinger (they share the name). Insert "the manga is literally better" here <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
I thought infinity was ok. Did get nostalgic at the opening and the big fight seeing all the old monsters
God dont remind me of that ending <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Fine they take turns <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
And Devilman is Nagai's favorite son (you know is true). Just put him everywhere
And then Shin Mazinger Zero using that again <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Iirc one story for Honey was that Juuzo Kabuto helped Dr.Kisaragi in the project (some ideas etc) thus helping make Honey
*cough that one visual novel thing or the occasional manga and SRW shenanigans*
And thats not even considering Getter wasnt originally his but Ishikawa's though they worked together
Ah yes Go Nagai just merging all his properties into the same universe though its not as jarring as GGG/Betterman since they all somewhat share same/similar themes etc because Nagai
It could be that Pizza and Pinchernone were originally ||artificial beings/weapons from Red Planet|| while Primarda and Polanoise were ||inhabitants from Green Planet||
Dont forget that if you're fused for too long with Zonder its permanent and if you get purified you die

oh wow didn't know that zoid9000 voiced in getter arc. congrats to him 👀 !
https://twitter.com/zoid9000/status/1439747794714120194
i know (dont remind me it hurts so much <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089> ). but its funny they went from ||one cliffhanger|| to a ||different but still a cliffhanger|| well i guess its a more hopefully/detailed one. reading that apparently this ending uses some more ideas left by Ishikawa. (Quick edit - i was wrong about that last bit. Still like the ending though even if ||its still a cliffhanger||)
also that ||getter mandala|| 👀
well finished getter arc anime. i liked the plot. the cg robots/fights are clunky as shit though. disappointing. and some animation/art at some parts is eeeeeh. can't remember very well how the manga went (think ill give it a refresher. rereading getter is always good for the getter soul) but i think they did a good job adapting the story. dislike the fact the one time they do a PROPER manga adaption its ONLY the final story arc soo yeah not friendly for newcomers (it would be so nice if SOMEBODY would license Getter Saga goddammit. staring at you Seven Seas <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>) though it does give info about those previous events slightly just in case. i liked what they did with the ending sequences and themes songs. also... soooo they ||went from one cliffhanger|| to ||another cliffhanger|| instead huh. aaw shit here we go again <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

the question is will they only do a rerun or will they also do a sequel to add more Ultra Units

i loved how ||not only does each girl gets to sing the ending seperately and eventually together but how the visual changes too depending on the episode||
i only remember cause i just like rewatching those scenes... several times <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
remember ||S1ep1 she states "she will be a hero" with S1ep12 ending it with her saying "i am a hero"||
is it the one during ||the big fight||? ||she says "i am sanshu middle school hero club's hero, yuuki yuuna" fully||. pretty sure ||it has nothing to do with the previous Yuunas or any connection to them and it was Yuuna just being extra badass because yes||. also yeah at this point ||during all S1 they never learn about the past or anything. their suppose to learn about it slowly afterwards when they find the hero diary. iirc that's when sonogo explains about a tradition of newborn baby girls getting named yuuna if they do a certain hand gesture because "good luck or something" (which yuna confirms she did it) and they assume it might be connected to takashima yuuna cause her name is in the dairy and well the dairy is censored to shit and back because Taisha.||

Shouldnt we be getting a port for it or something <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>
F
Oh yes it does. Itll just stay at 2nd place
Besides the animes ya gotta also take into account the rest of the multimedia. Pokemon excelled in pretty much everything compared to digimon. Digimon has gotten better but itll never reach pokemon level.
Again
But no i vaguely remember them always being low leveled. Blahblah they help train huckmon. Their just OP for training with a Royal Knight etc because special backstory
Aah the "fancy" low levels then
Though i think i do remember the sistermons being very low level type which surprised me
Games follow whatever official type their given though. If they were something else then they either mustve changed them at some point or you remembered wrong <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

(which he is also stepping down from his role there too)
oh wait no. they did the OP for the Ultraman animated show
the same group who apparently does the OP for The Misfit Demon King Academy so even more ouch
that's a lot of roles he got replaced in <:YumiStare:688429724065988721>
we'll just have to wait and see who replaces him and hope their good at it.

Megas XLR is culture <:VanessaSmug:689395769199165447>
their complaining because NoWaYu is one of the best YuYuYu LN stories that people wanted adapted and they butchered it into 3 rushed episodes. and its like Lank said. S3 is literally all over by adapting NoWaYu, KuMeYu and rehashing stuff from S1 and S2 in different perspective and just all over. i just dont understand why they didnt just focus on KuMeYu and YuYuYu only for S3 if they wanted to rehash the plot of S2. then they couldve done a S4 and adapted NoWaYu with Apocrypha
Happy Birthday <:ShirabeToast:672245704118501376>
> points this to all them anime studios or the random manga/LN authors
why we no have this! give this!
ok yeah i would definitely love to watch/read something like that
good for him. and then you also have Jolene's EN VA getting her dream to voice her too <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Unless its a movie trilogy. People were concerned for Heaven's Feel at first too until they confirmed it was a movie trilogy
ok maybe because i gave it a day but ep6 felt better
Oh and that whole ||selection of idol ai|| <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Im at ep5. So far i care for no one but the giant robots. Characters arent bad just no one has caught my interest. MC, delinquent buddy, catboy are ok. Blue hair badass chick seems interesting but gotta wait and see. That first combination sequence in ep1 was so stupid though ||they have to freefall to combine. Like why? Thank god they replace that with the carries|| oh and so far that whole ||alien girl possesing the one chick and getting into too many misunderstandings is making cringe||  <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

like i said. the wiki has them all posted. gotta check the individual chapter pages to read them 👀
also just finding out that the translated LN chapters are posted in the YuYuYu Wiki. while you can yarhar WaSuYu, KuMeYu and NoWaYu fully there is no full yarhar for Hero History Apocrypha (the last new LN), only separate/individual chapters (because people were waiting for the full physical book for the bonus chapter which is also in the wikinow that i notice 👀 )
yes
KuMeYu and NoWaYu are LNs (both already translated online so you can yarhar them). NoWaYu also has a manga (also TLed iirc).

so an AU/reboot/partial reboot wouldnt be too weird to happen
reminder we also have the RWBY mangas with a bunch of original story stuff that probably wouldnt work with the current story stuff i think (havent watched RWBY in forever so not caught up at all)

oh also ||sonoko just taking over taisha. good. hinata and wakaba would be proud, especially hinata with all the chaos <:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>|| the final was definitely satisfying.
final episode epilogue <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> also also ||sentinels now SAKIMORI TEAM lmao tsubasa would be proud <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>||
hmmm the ost for ||the final fight (from with the spirits showing up to yuna hero punch)|| is nice i guess but i miss the old one for it. im too attached to it and its engraved in my head. nice new animation bits though
oh fuck you for using the ||gin's death|| ost while ||togo is trying to save yuna from the ritual||
OH MY FUCKING GOD ||GIN'S MOTHERFUCKING SWORD <:KirikaCry:674720015047720961> !!!!||
oooh FUCK ||the cannon was shaped the spider lily/chikage's symbol. yes i know the tower/cannon was named after her so the feels hit even harder <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> ||
lmao ok tat bit with ||miroku being dramatic and the stardust just stop right behind <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>||
dear Taisha fuck you <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
screw that. s3 shouldve focused on the sentinels and yuyuyu heroes. and then make an s4 for NoWaYu and the apocrypha book goddammit <:TsubasaIgnite:672861877407318047>
the fact ||shiratori dies right from the start and then showcasing wakabas backstory and that we know they failed|| wouldve done the job in ripping the bandaid though <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
oh and totally forgot ||the hoe is still around <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>|| sucks we didnt even get a ||shiratoru visual at the least<:KirikaMad:688188152891834417>||
finally continuing my yuki yuna s3 dai mankai watch after 10k years. got through eps 5-8 the ||nogi wakaba arc|| im still mad we didnt get an actual full adaption for it. sure just jump right into ||killing tamako and anzu||. at least they did put some character interactions and new dialogue stuff but still. those are also some interesting story changes they decided on but i guess they wanted to fit as much as possible. also that bit with ||Tyuna talking with Yyuna. even from beyond the grave she was willing to save another <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616> she is the true hero god. fuck you shinju and you other gods too <:HibikiScreech:633468460030230548>||

anyways, its the same thing with the wait for the GX set, they could use the BRay versions for AXZ/XV but as mentioned they still havent released boxsets for those 2 so maybe risk of reverse importation so we must wait <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
just mentioning differences in general
the only difference is the lack of the soundtracks which come with the JP Boxsets, the art cards and at the very least the JP G Bluray has miku's SSJ transformation which the US version doesnt have

if im reading right they're mostly digital but they do publish physical too. it depends on the work? sometimes they release digital first and once they finish a digitalvolume they publish it. youd either have to check their site or wait and see

basically a bunch of anime licenses expiring on march 31st. most of them are still available to watch on HiDive so i guess this is a list of sentai licensed titles so makes sense their being removed because of the crunchy/funi merge

well its an anime i guess. time for some alternate IBO/AU shenanigans then

i keep forgetting about the original promo art for the anime that is some AUWeiss so yeah we should be getting canon divergence at some point. also wait until the very end of the trailer. fuck i just noticed that last bit.
maybe trailers, s1 and s2? i know s1 was short iirc
so far it looks like its just RWBYS1 (with trailers. how nice of them to remember those things are canon). wonder when/if they will do any divergence during this
good for you. now go watch YuYuYu S2 The Washio Sumi Chapter and join in more ||suffering <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>||

They still have a "special bond" though at least
Late but yeah S1 was definitely hinting for NanoYuno (probably copying CCS Sakura/Syaron)  but sidelined and killed it for NanoFate. Iirc there was even some NanoYuno dialogue/scene from StrikerS that hinted/framed it as them "married to their own work/not working out/going their separate ways" so yeah permakilling NanoYuno
Probably A's
Also NanoFate mascots bonding i guess <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I thought it be YunoTinyArf. She works with him and is the one spending most time with him now <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Yes
Yeah at least read Nogi Wakaba is a Hero either novel or manga
Note the anime adapts 3 of the novels. Though 2 of them get heavily rushed but it covers "enough"
Iirc they were publishing washio sumi novel chapters as s1 aired so hey the OG experience <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
And if at any moment you change your mind you can actually read the novel chapters in the YukiWiki if you dont want to DL them. Their not long novels anyways
Id say watch s1 first. Then S2-Washio Sumi Chapter. Then read Nogi Manga. Then S2- Hero Chapter and then S3. For the drama

Mazinkaiser SKL says hi
Hnn dont know how to feel about it. It may be old but its a good classic and, i havent read the manga so im not 100% sure, but i assume its one of the few good anime/manga adaptions so it doesnt feel like it needs a new one even if its animation is dated.
Wiki - The series is a historical drama set in the years preceding and during the French Revolution. Using a combination of historical personages and original characters, The Rose of Versailles focuses primarily on the lives of two women: the Queen of France Marie Antoinette, and Oscar François de Jarjayes, who serves as commander of the Royal Guard.
I mean it did get some new chapters and a side story spinoff iirc
Just woke up and saw the news. Just in shock. RIP legend <:ChrisPray:672578403156885504>

Ah. I dont think she's the first but she is very iconic
If you mean 2 distinct tones for colors  then yeah there are plenty out there. Look at all them yugioh protags. If you mean the colors then probably somewhere. If you mean the hairstyle then yeah there are. If you mean the specific combo that Stocking has uuuh maybe somewhere. Its just that Stocking is iconic
Yeah no its not toonamis fault people hated on G Gundam. Gundam fanbase was just like that. Toonami just happened to bring gundam to a more worldwide market and more peopl means more opinions i guess.
How about all the hate towards G Gundam back in the day. ItS NoT GunDaM
<:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
And i like Mikazuki. Better than Hero <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
I liked Barbatos. I like the bits of animal /wolf look it had and the progression from dug up broken to slow armoring as they kept rebuilding it. I hadnt liked a Gundam unit since G Shining or MS8TH Ez8. Then again i havent watched all gundam and just come and go
Hyaku-Shiki from Zeta has magic gold paint iirc <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

And as usual discotek delivers <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
Or switch S3 to be Hero Chapter and slap the butchered version of Nogi for relevance reasons (and i guess to cover some runtime maybe. Gotta keep that 12 eps count somehow i guess) and then S4 be the proper Nogi adaption.
They shouldve done Washio Sumi and Mebuki (the first 3 eps from S3 but a bit more extended and end it on a cliffhanger to make us suffer) for S2. S3 shouldve been an actual good adaption of Nogi and S4 all the plot for Hero Chapter (and the rest of the Mebuki story)
Dont worry. Pretty sure everyone reacted the same way too. And yes Mebuki and especially the Nogi Stories were butchered. Im ok if Mebuki got incorporated overall but Nogi shouldve had its own adaption period. Sometimes i think someone should take S2/3 and splice them together to make one coherent season. If the one thing S3 did right at least it was the very extended final fight and the ending/post-credits.

anyways thank you for the help <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
and good to know finding the option that auto exists qbit when you close it <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
so seed limit to 0 and pause so i dont seed?
yeah i always do. just checking the settings and such
ok thank you. just finished installing <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
ok. dont need to install anything else for it do i?
ah
can i use the most recent or do i gotta get some old version? read too much about "use old versions for x cause blahblah"
hnnnn any suggestions for a good torrent client? got a new laptop and havent installed one yet. gotta get my anime and shit somehow <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
Iirc its just the same.
well some of the novels were still in publication/unfinished. so hindsight 20/20 i guess. maybe they didnt want to do a proper nogi adaption because apocrypha (which is a companion/expansion to nogi) wasnt finished. no excuse for Mebuki though. that shouldve been adapted with Washio to be S2. they couldve done a proper S3-Hero with hinting they knew about Nogi. if they felt like it afterwards then adapt Nogi with Apocrypha as S4 (fucking hell the interview for Dai-Mankai says their "willing to do a proper adaption if there is demand" which is BS <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> )
and the mix/watch order i suggested still isnt perfect because some scenes from after certain S3 episodes take place before/during/after X thing in whichever part of S2. someone would have to edit/mesh the episodes together to make a proper mix/watch version ugh <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
welcome to the shitfest they made out of this when it shouldve been easy <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>. S2 shouldve been Washio and Kusunoki adaptions with a cliffhanger ending hinting to Hero. S3 couldve been Nogi and S4 couldve been a proper Hero but nope <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
To clarify a few details -
S2 is divided into Washio Sumi Chapter (Washio no Shou) and Hero Chapter (Yuusha no Shou). Washio is the prequel to S1 and it was originally 3 movies. you can watch either the tv version (6 episodes) or movies (3 movies). Hero Chapter is the sequel to S1 and is 6 episodes. there is an "Ep.0" which is just a recap.

S3 is called Dai-Mankai Chapter (Dai-Mankai no Shou) and is 12 episodes. it acts as extra/expanded content to s2 plus adapts 2 light novel stories. Kusunoki Mebuki which is a side-story taking place between s1-s2 and Nogi Wakaba which is a farther prequel. the ln adaptions are fast-paced and in the case of the Nogi Wakaba its crap (which sucks cause best ln).

Tried to go through the episodes for a refresher and find some kind of mixed watch order for S2-S3.

Easy watch order - S1 > S2 Washio Sumi Chapter.

ok now here is where shit gets a lil complicated

S2 Hero Chapter EP1-2 > S3 Dai-Mankai EP1-4 (i wouldve suggested this first but the halfway point/final of Ep.4 spoilers the end of Hero 2).
Hero Ep.3 > Dai Ep.5-8 > Hero Ep.4-5
Dai Ep.9-12 (you can watch Hero Ep.6 after for a few extra bits of cut dialogue and a different epilogue but Dai 9-12 is overall the better end/final)
it just keeps getting better lmao

Seen E7, Gosick, i think Death Parade, PsychoPass and Durarara
Nothing like picking fights with ||eldritch horrors||
Oh yes mystery inc is good. Been forever since i watched it though. Missed too many episodes
I think its cause most are subtext or word of god but this one is plain in your face confirm
At least for mistery incorporated she's confirmed gay
There's a screenshot post "word of god" detailing that yes
i wonder how accurate this one comment i saw in YT is. that G-Witch reminded them of the story The Tempest or something.
plot twist ||she just goes back to her real name or combines the names||
ive seen plenty of gundam. you're never ready when they ||destroy the gundam|| especially when you like them for one reason or another. you will never be ready for it <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
finished G-Witch Ep1. read the lyrics for the OP and read the novel prequel. i already saw Ep0 weeks back. i am now prepared for the PAIN train! not <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>  i will not be ready when they decide to ||destroy Aerial/Lfrit|| cause all her lines read she is ready to sacrifice herself to protect Suletta. God it's ||Chamber|| all over again <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
Gotta economy somehow <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
Enjoy the ride. It gets heavy science jargon later on but its still really good. I liked it. <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>

looks like that Aerial was more merciless than the tv version <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
looking it up Wing Gundam gets blown and rebuilt a million and one times. Heero obviously piloting on and off but obviously switching to Wing Zero. in the anime ||its destroyed/abandoned|| and, according to the wiki, in the novel ||it gets rebuilt and enshrined after the war as a symbol of peace alongside the other Gundams||
the good thing is that the google translate version is also still legible enough to understand so even if the fan translation gets lost or something we won't have to worry much
https://tenor.com/view/coincidence-i-think-not-coincidence-i-think-not-the-incredibles-gif-5096707
since they remind us of chris and hibiki then they must be modeled after chris and hibiki and THEREFORE the creator must ship Chris/Hibiki!
hey we got G Gundam. that's something <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
unless Suletta/Aerial or them with the whole school together ||pull the OP card and stop it||
got my popcorn ready for when the ||school either gets blown up or dropped on a planet getting the colony drop treatment||
id imagine ||Suletta could get comatosed temporarily but make it back and then get it right the next time|| but yeah at least SOMEONE is gonna get ||perma data stormed in the head from trying to play god||, bets on the dude (what was his name again? Guel?) cause he's a prick
OH. even better Aerial ||humming happy birthday instead as it saves Suletta/Miorine||
hey hey betting ||suletta's mom dies singing HAPPY BIRTHDAY as part of her "atonement" freeing Suletta/Miorine form her revenge plot|| <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
either way maybe it wont be as bleak as the "standard" gundam "war" show but i do expect some deaths or maimings because things gotta get worse before they get better. as long as Miorine's dad and probably ||Suletta's Mom in some "equal exchange karma"|| die im good
hell i could imagine ||Suletta's mom taking revenge by trying to murder the whole school satellite the same way they had done to her old family/home and Suletta doing everything to stop that form ever happening again||
if there are any Utena/Tempest parallels in Mercury then im half expecting Miorine to ||"betray Suletta" to save her because she feels she's "too far trapped" in the clusterfuck made by her father and Suleta's mom but Suletta forgives and still tries to save her anyways because fuck fate and bs|| and then Aerial ||turning against its creator helps and sacrifices itself to save Suletta/Miorine blessing them||. if one of them does get disfigured or something i guess ||Suletta could loose her arm as a parallel to her own mother at least||
goddamn <:MikuSad:336657015961026560>

aka the ship where ||some of the OG macross cast|| is onboard. iirc extra materials or one of the shows mentions ||the Megaroad 1 had been found|| but no new anime or manga etc will ever cover its voyage/people due to honoring one of the OG VAs that had passed away from ||suicide||
If you dont mind the character trait changes its actually pretty good. I didnt mind, its colorful, wacky but has its serious moments too. Loved the characters and actually enjoyed it. Plus with only 2 seasons (eps usually being 11/15mins each) and 1 movie it wouldnt take long to watch. There are also some minishorts legally posted in YT. The problem is Netflix only has S1 and the Movie. ParamountPlus has S1/S2. So either multiple subscriptions or yarhar the seven seas.

English Fire Bomber CD direct from the wiki
ENGLISH FIRE. All the songs on this album have been redone in English by the band Fire Bomber American. Instead of simply being English versions of Fire Bomber songs, the makers of Macross have created an English version of the band Fire Bomber. In the Macross universe, Fire Bomber American is a band on the English-speaking fleet Macross 11 that claims that the Macross 7 Fire Bomber is a rip-off of it. The singers for this band are also different.[14] According to the fictional Macross continuity Lynn Kaifun, a character from the first TV series from 1982 (who was Lynn Minmay's cousin and also her former manager) is the creator and manager of Fire Bomber American.
when the apparent bio for the english songs for Fire Bomber is because apparently ||the fucker makes his own bootleg Fire Bomber group and "translates" the OG Fire Bomber songs and passes them as his/theirs|| oh and i think ||he also passes Fire Bombers accomplishments as his. fucker is just riding in their name||

Seeing Guel's mech just being ||autopiloted|| that one time gives good inspiration for ||Elan4 to fuck over Real Elan if they try to hurt Suletta or something|| <:KirikaAnger:497114266923696158>
Im still hoping for ||Elan4 coming back by possesing Pharact if they try to imitate the ai thing by copy/pasting the collective Elan Data||
I do expect every adult to suffer terrible fates though. I'll feel bad for the kids that could get possibly get caught in the crossfire though.
Except you just said that the show is about breaking free from whatever fate is being forced on them. So the ||sentient Ai also breaking free from its so called "purpose of revenge" assigned to it by its mother also works. Aerial considered Sulettas words in the novel when she herself was doubting and fearing for Suletta's fate/safety. Not to mention the system was made by the people of Vanadis. This whole revenge thing is against what they truly wanted for the system which is hope for the future.|| Prospera may have made her but Suletta will end up being more important. Also if the show is using/inspired in the Tempest then ||Aerial could turn on Prospera to save Suletta and Miorine||
GWitch - The only thing that is confusing so far is the ||21 year thing||. Everything can be easily explained as ||The people from Vanadis always referred to Lfrith as a child/their child/family so that continued to carry over. Suletta is the real Eri under a different name cause protection. Lfrith/Aerial imprinted on Eri and the sentient ai takes her child form because of it. She doesnt have 9 "souls" but its just Aerial echoing through all her parts. Suletta does say she heard Aerial's voice even more clearly so Aerial was really going ham. Prospera referring to her as her daughter isnt surprising because of the whole Vanadis thing and Aerial using/imprinted Eris data which is why its OS is named E.S. Eri/Suletta perfected it where Prospera failed. Not surprised Prospera attaches herself more to Aerial since with Eris data it remembers everything that happened in Vanadis|| besides the witch traitor knows who Prospera really is and didnt seem weirded out or find anything out of the ordinary with Suletta but shocked Prosoera would go so far to drag her daughter into it too (and then prospera calling her out on the ||the nameless artificial sacrifices||)
Speaking of GWitch i like how we got all these theories about Aerial being ||the real eri etc|| because people want the drama even if it is farfetch but, considering elan/pharact are the people/gundam with all the shit luck, no one has brought up the possibility that ||if the company figures out aerial uses an arteficial sentient ai that they would try to replicate it with the elan data and Elan4 could become the Pharact instead and protect Suletta|| <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

Id say it also goes against Suletta/Aerial being the perfected Gund-ARM system because natural born compatibility/miracle. The point was the GUND system was fucking over people. People who could break through several of the limit/walls whatever were called witches. Eri finally breaking through the final wall thing thanks to meer compatibility a true miracle witch.

truthfully i havent seen delta yet but i assume your good.
bearing the occasional callback macross series in general are pretty standalone so you should be good to watch. the only exception i think is macross7 because of some returning cast from the OG macross
i find it funny astroboy and tetsujin did somewhat managed to survive the purge though <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
no! there is no getter or daiguard or diebuster or even symphogear. oooh we reaching the end soon <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
<@279341087494242304> ANOTHER chapter just came out <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
ok caught up. goddamn the madness <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
wait what the fuck he released more?! the fuck. counting the previous ones from the other day that's 10 chapters total in 6 days <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>! i havent read chapter 27-30 yet <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829> <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
its a shame that after so many times the mazinger zero story has been used in SRW they still haven't animated this finisher attack. the wait continues <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>
<@279341087494242304> <@258455337995075585> ok went back to check. we start of with ||grendizer, getter, jeeg, then we got raideen, voltes and combattler. then zambot, daitarn, daimos and gundam rx-78, then ideon (i confused him with gunbuster but he shows up later), the valkyrie from macross... i can't tell the next 3 in the same page but i know i recognize them grrrrrr <:ElsaSick:689395768754569359> (edit - ok i think one is layzner maybe), then its dancouga i think, then gunbuster and eva, then another fella i cant quite tell (edit agan - im an idiot. i think thats gaogaigar), gurren lagann and Jaeger from Pacifc Rim.|| and those are the ones i could tell from the main big silhouettes. obviously more among the small ones. and it is truly a beautiful radiant view <:MikuJoy:738234684655403110>
<@279341087494242304> <@258455337995075585> you also got ||dancouga, i think voltron, zambot, daitarn, trider g7||

well its finally all fully translated so you can go ahead and read it if you're interested
||because conditions there suck. Not cause there was some sinister plot sacrificing children (except suletta) <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>||
Not really. Suletta clearly says she ||heard Aerial even more clearly at that moment|| so there probably arent ||a bunch of child souls|| but  just ||one Aerial alone controlling it all||.
my understanding is the YuYuYu phone game story ended so the game is ending BUT their planning to release it as a VN or something later

interesting tidbit about the saban moon thing. during the last story arcs of JPSailor Moon (both in manga and anime) they introduce the concept of ||planetary crystals|| but due to how the series was published/released we dont get into that until like 1995-1996 . Saban Moon  introduces that concept in its pilot in 1994. so huh go fig <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>

any stuff post-StrikerS doesnt seem to really stick
i liked StrikerS though i dont remember much since its been so long. i guess its cause in S1/S2 NanoFate are kids on the front lines and we follow their adventures and then BAM timeskip in Strikers they and the other OG Cast are adults in positions of power and leading/training a new generation. sure we get flashbacks occasionally but it feels like we're missing a season inbetween
but hey we get adult nanofate being extra gay and ||mama's cause plot convenient adopted daughter that looks like the both of them||
Vivid i dont know. havent watched
but hey we got Subaru out of it
StrikerS has people divided i guess. first half slow. stuff happens in the 2nd half. also the OG cast now older and them adding a bunch of new characters
it was A's TV and the A's Movie. both are good
true
extra materials/drama CD for the 1st movie was adult nanoha post-strikers going to a studio because they want to make a movie about her. so insert the movies.
you know what's really funny? the movies are canon to the TV universe
plus i guess watching some movies would be quicker than a 26eps season
sure
the fact one can actually suggest either the TV version or movie version of Season 2 cause both are good either way
its 4 movies. though the first 2 are variations of S1 and A's/S2 respectively. after that you either watch the other 2 movies or watch StrikerS/S3. and as mentioned the movies are also somewhat their own continuity too
it is a very satisfying moment and yes you will love it <:Ver:704169051391524875>
she fucked around and she found out is what happened and it was so goddamn satisfying <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
oh and vita's ||almost sacrifice|| dont ever mess with the duke of hammers
favorite hype bits still being ||subaru vs her sister||, nanoha going full ||revenge on the evil bitch|| and of course nanoha ||adoption beam||
im sure nanoha is better than Victory at least
s1 and s2 are 13 episode each. StrikerS/S3 is 24 iirc?
another way to describe StrikerS i guess is, you know how in Symphogear we go on imagining about having the Gears grow up and some or all of them joining SONG as proper agents and training a new generation. that but unlike the SONG crew, the nano crew is more involved
I think it is? Sounds pretty normal/reasonable
Its not just tge OG Cast. The law applies to everyone similar
Cause people fear too much destructive power
And OG Cast are plain high rank mages pretty much <:Ver:704169051391524875>
Power limiter on the OG Cast? Not sure if its said then or later but pretty much they have a law that mages with very high ranks gotta put a limiter on for safety purposes
Yeah the problem with StrikerS early on is that they focus on the new cast first so the 1st half is very slow/nothing though sprinkling stuff for far later iirc
im kinda liking the orange one. i want her tiny hat <:TriplePeek:689568598938615939>

true friendship achieved
ange and hilda finally bonding by mutually wanting to fuck shit up
sometimes its also fun to watch the preview stuff at the end of the episodes. one giving an explanation of how Tusk ||survived is suppose death|| and is still a BS explanation lol. another is them jokingly explaining why the show is called Cross Ange "because Ange is crossed". yes that is the reason.
And yeah didnt like him at first either cause tacked on guy love interest but grew to like him too. Just the writers putting him in unnecesary situations for stupid reasons.
Vilkiss is pretty much connected to Ange cause reasons. So of course it knows where she is and how important Tusk is to her. He just goes "vilkiss u wanna save her/be with her and i love her and i wanna saver too. Lets go save her together and fuck shit up" and so they do because fuck you embryo
Reminds me of Nirvash/Renton/Eureka in OG Eureka Seven
He only gets to pilote on account of being the main MC love interest. Their so in love Vilkiss changes color to combine their colors
oh wait someone in the comments also mentioning there is an anime/manga called Touch
another Brave? maybe Exkaiser for actually having reused Transformers in it

also Cutey Honey getting her own ||giant mech|| <:MikuExcited:738174629251907594>
plus Mazinger Angels is actually pretty great. its nice to have an actual AU piece of Mazinger media focused on the girl squad and giving them the spotlight and make them OP. loved some of the new weapons and unique forms they get. and the Jun/Venus story for the final. ||poor Aira <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>|| Prefer Angels to Angels Z. Angels Z is also great but ||they downgraded Aphrodites design for some reason. come on its years after Angels. it shouldnt have taken them so long to make another of her. no Diana or Venus either. I guess Hikari retired to just be full staff but Jun never shows up again. guess she retired too but they dont bother mentioning her at all.||

i've forgotten it. iirc piloting all the mechs will burn your memories. but there was something specifically special about the main one that i cant remember. it also fed the other mechs/pilots so the main pilot is always the one most fucked up because everyone else was fine and didnt contribute? it's still hella stupid <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874>

oh ho hopefully they make it good 👀
right now there is an omnibus edition that is either out or will be out soon which will have said chapters but that will probably be the last collection to ever have those chapters. if there are any future publications they would be removed
yes
hmm from what i found out the 2 banned chapters are called "the richest duck in the world" and "the dream of a lifetime". both chapters contain a character named Bombie which yeah questionable design <:HibikiThreeSeconds:689200719072591874> (said character appears in the reboot cartoon with a different look btw) but rather than edit or put a disclaimer they would rather ban/remove said chapters which apparently is very awkward because those are apparently very important final chapters(?) and screws up the story progression (?)

Technically Jodio isnt used by itself but as part of a phrase. Youd say something like "se jodio". Which is one of tge many equivalents to "she/he/they're screwed/fucked" <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
Late to the JoJo convo. Wait the new guys name is "Jodio"? For real? Cause as a spanish speaker this is some funny shit. Literally naming someone a spanish curse word lmao <:VanessaCracked:639136452600397829>
