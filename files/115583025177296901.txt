It was a glorious highlight reel for || hibiki ||
|| hibiki's transformation ahhh ||
yeah wait what's this about a gold medal?
during the news report
fudo <:TsubasaDisgust:349013662775902209>
yikes
BBQ PARTY <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
the noise hibiki made when the bug flew into her mouth was hilarious
OYOYO
just gals being pals <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
because fudo is a dick
fine is shirabe's stand lol
we're going to get gjallarhorn and a kanade + serena song Kappa
do you think we're going to get a villain song?
and vitalization is kinda a super rocket punch lmao
she punched shirabe and kirika
her just taking off was pretty funny
wolf girl is cute though <:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
DATO SHITE MO
god bless aoi yukki and her shouting
saint germain is her stand lmao
i'm worried about how the rest of SONG are basically hostages now though
this is like, episode 11 level shit
how many episodes do we have left? NOT ENOUGH
she did what she needed to in the fight against vanessa
and maria didn't job for once
the hanasaku yuki duet coming through
ahh that was so hype
wait actually?
don't forget the segway noise
i feel like that'd end up like something out of madoka lol
Golden Jojo hamster Jesus
I personally welcome hamster Jesus
Well he apparently had what he wants
So good
Maybe ogawa will save hq
Did she also have some lotus symbolism too?
he also watches action movies
i want tsubasa to sing him into submission
mecha idol jojo
mecha jojo
nah it's jojo
^
it's gonna be 7*
more pls
i'm happy to see bikki being a badass
hibiki miku unison in ep 9 <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
(and fists)
with the power of friendship
i hope not
give hibiki noriko's (lack of) pants <:MikuLewd:336656493606862868>
maybe inazuma kick?
just have bikki do a gainax pose or something
pouty bikki
nah bikki's is still the best <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
lol this is the spoiler channel
more hibimiku ducks
<:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
nah, not the level of the strawberry jam episode
well that episode happened
hm
holy shit ogawa is hilarious
holy shit
this episode
oh shit
6 MORE EPISODES ISN'T ENOUGH
NEXT WEEK WHEN
hahahaha
https://i.imgur.com/MtWvPZ4.jpg
huh
extra bikki song pls
but i guess they'll probably be fighting together for the most part?
yeah i thought using final commander for a group fight was strange
yeah i laughed
well that was an episode
~~how long before hibiki gets to kiss a god?~~
don't be silly - transformation takes no time in anime <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
https://i.imgur.com/GeyhZYy.jpg
i very much doubt we're done with them
cute bikki
hence Fine's orbital cannon
and in Symphogear, the moon is basically the "device" that propagates the curse
https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/p__/images/2/23/Genjuro_Kazanari.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20131019160646&path-prefix=protagonist
there was an interesting point that pre-kanade's death, genjuuro was actually skinny
i think we just chalk it down to training and action movies
well yatsuhiro doesn't either
action movies
well she fought the other gears and took miku for fudou
(although the betrayal is still up in the air)
they got approval for her though
~~chance of losing gears though~~
yup
that's what happens when your wife is a god-killing main character
just casually 1v1ing a gear, driving genjuuro through a boulder
^
probably?
that's...pretty much any regular show lol
it's just in the flashback
nah, he's still jacked in S1
fudou is so exaggerated lol
https://i.imgur.com/Mjk2mMn.jpg
~~except for the power of love~~
i liked the episode, but  was the art kinda derpy today?
damn  hibiki being a straight up badass like always and maria +tsubasa was awesome
dess
"highest good rose cross" lmao
ahhh it's fushichou no flamme
https://streamable.com/orxnk
https://streamable.com/e9v6u
https://streamable.com/orxnk

just cut and paste phonic gain
it's ok genjuuro will just beat yggdrasil into submission
their songs are literally confessing their undying love
<:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>




looks pretty frog-like lol
how about this one
Highest Good Rose Cross <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
i liked chris' bow though
to assert dominance
T-posing
sad elsa with her droopy ears üò¶

send help
it's been a wild 5 seasons
i teared up during the zesshou scene at the end
yeah she has the little rooster comb thing lol
one episode left isn't enough
i'm so hyped guys
i prefer short hair, but kirika is still cute
frozen 2 looks great

It's currently Saturday and the episode has been up for 6 hours? Time zones?

gifs are meh though <:HibikiTired:422925410490253313>

is tsubasa seriously using her hair to steer w/e the hell she's doing?
worth
?????
already there
guys what do i do now üò¶
i mean, they played an instrumental version
lmao
when do they normally announce the live?
ordered the bd <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
reminder
so, what career do you think all the gears will have after the series?
so do they really need to explicitly say it?
they're pretty mucha lready hitting us over the head on it
i mean, my opinion is that it's very clear how those two feel from their interactions and lyrics
and that girl who was broadcast naked
and Tsubasa
Maria
maria???

tsubasa secret attack
oh it's a kabuki thing?
why is she steering with her hair?
also, can someone please explain to me what tsubasa is doing here?
still broken apparently
*started playing
i kinda broke when metanoia started playing it
^
they're literally always singing about loving each other
and kirika going nyanyanya in the middle of the song lol
speaking of nyaa, the first time i heard dangerous sunshine
nyaaaaaa
is that supposed to be axz or xv lol
and then once a month after or something like that
first one is next week, i think?
still need to fit fighting songs in there somewhere though
yes pls
would have to see
the characters are a huge part of why i love symphogear
hard to say tbh
or just like S1?
like all of it?
a reboot?
symphogear movie when
i mean, yeah, that's what i mean by on purpose
well, i personally think it was on purpose <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
almost certainly on purpose
yeah i started crying when it started lol
i still need to download Maria, Shirabe, and Chris' songs
yeah, it's great
don't let the shem-ha bite
sleep tight
night!
?
that, all love's blazing, and rainbow flower are top 3 for me
although it was kinda funny how hibiki was the only one doing anything in that scene
yeah hanasaku yuuki was also fantastic
yeah that was so hype
although a fair amount of times it's someone else singing while fighting
yeah macross has singing
missing the singing though
sounds about right
i keep telling my friends to watch symphogear but no one has <:TsubasaZesshou:336656472362713089>
yeah axz opening is also amazing
oof
nothing has changed
because i thought bikki was cute lol
although i remember having S1 on my to watch list when it came out
~~like the transformations~~
although we got some great scenes in XV to draw people in
everything about that scene lol
^same
i'm just here to shitpost
you're making me sadddd
hasn't commie been around for a long time?
‚ù§
lol
kirika being kirika
oh voiced by aoi yuuki
enough time for another 5 seasons of symphogear <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
we're getting S3 of railgun tho <:HibikiSmile:336656661387411456>
of course the symphochat knows about the show with lesbians
with like a billion tweets lmao
i did my part
also rookie i was waiting for this one
spice and wolf :^)
you know what hasn't gotten a third season?
season 6 and 7 when?
ranka > sheryl <:TsubasaLetsDestroyABike:336656845181550592>
'night
*someone singing while someone else is fighting

welcome to the sad party
maybe they'll announce two more seasons this live :^)
have fun
üò¶
totally a wedding dress
i mean, mikugear was basically a wedding dress
-cough- xdu
XDU üê≥
and the fact that no one knows about symphogear in the west lol
english dub with singing <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
~~all stars~~
and love live is still going technically
i meant celebrating on camera
chris knew that actually celebrating your birthday is bad luck
i definitely was lol
if they were all men this would be a very different show lol
to hoetate!

<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>

cut and paste <:KirikaDess:336656774251806720>
there were a lot of best moments
~~just play SIF and SIFAS~~
<:MikuBliss:336657233712513024>
more shouty singing
and the rest
i just want more hibiki pls
for now i just want news on the live
pre-ordered the BD for the first time and no live announced yet <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
should i cancel my BD since there's no news on the live? <:HibikiCrying:421432969996271616>
lol someone above said that Xtreme Vibes was Axia no Kaze with the second part done right
i saw someone hating on the second half of Axia no Kaze <:ChrisOi:586551700987576330>
Okay, so it was there in the end, right? I'm not crazy?
I guess I have bad memory
Did they? I thought I remembered hearing the activations
I think it worked pretty well in the actual episode? It's been a while since I watched AXZ
I was just throwing it out there, but I should've pinged you after ,sorry
I didn't mean to actually start a debate
It's probably my third (?) favourite AXZ song?
I like it <:HibikiAAA:620079684109205534>
they're so cute ahhh
oh man, i just read the lyrics to Shirabe's B-side and holy crap those two are so cute
