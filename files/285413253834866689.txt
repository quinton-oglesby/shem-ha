Good description
I love her role as Julia as well Million Live concert which the inspiration of Bang Dream came
Aimi is goood
I wish Symphogears to be popular in west as They don't give a fuck about it for reasons
~~EVIL JULIA/KASUMI~~
Also Aimi is evil AF
Can't wait they gonna announce that they liked Symphogear
~~Fuck those Bayformers-ism on Uprising as Boyega was solely responsible to make Pacific Rim looks like Bayformer~~
~~Fuck Uprising my friend~~
Can't wait for Episode 3
That Thomas Whitmore, the dude who said the famous speech about ID4 to fight aliens with Will Smith taking to save the world 

XV IS TRUE INDEPENDENCE DAY SEQUEL CONFIRMED ~~Fuck ID4 sequel just like Pacific Rim Uprising~~
Did they referenced ID4 character
Tsubasa must singing Baka Mitai
I hope she can beat that Kira Kira Doki Doki
Will Tsubasa break down in Eps3 for what happened?
Ok
I wonder why Sony still want Tom Holland for their cinematic universe instead of focusing Spider Verse
I love Spider-Verse
I love every bit of it and fuck critics
The last movie i watched in theaters was Godzilla KOTM
Same <@283649756226387978>
Captain Marvel was basically Hibiki but shittier plot
It's irony that Western are forcing their franchises by making all girls cast and failed so hard
As well Symphogear did made darker and mature issues better than ~~DCEU AND MCU~~ did
Like that crying scene feels like Nana went Tsubasa voice to her real voice
It gonna be heartbreaking for her
I don't know how Nana feels about that scene
|| Tsubasa's dad RIP ||

Also if anyone know Nana Mizuki's father died a long time ago
Star Wars will have shitty ending too
Let Symphogear having better ending series than GoT
DON'T GAME OF THRONES ENDING FOR US
Episode IX sounds mess and the leaks sounds true

Symphogear will have better ending than 80% of hyped shows/movies
It is but still it gave us better ending than what Game of Thrones give to us after 8 seasons
They know what they doing at least
The ending was just perfect

It wasn't suffered from "hype to disappoint" *looks to GoT and Star Wars*
I wanna say..S T E P ON  U S, MARIA-SAMA
It took 5 seasons to make HibiMiku canon
G E I
It seems it up to us to make the ending
I mean this is the same company who was desperately making Episode IX as fan service movie
Knowing Disney, they're really determinted to kill *it*
as well Rise of the Skywalker will be colossial failure. Even in Japan, they wasn't hyped on that as Symphogear and even Honkai Impact got more attention than those
Their addiction to F4 and X-Men will be start of their downfall
I hope they won't
Disney can even damage Anime Industry as they actively attempts to kill 2D Animation
People only care Marvel as they happy when Fox got brought by Disney but how about other movies? Aliens? Predators?
As they will replace it with MCU movie as well piracy will be huge due to that
We will no longer having Die Hard showing in every Christmas
As they reported it wasn't "Marvel/Star Wars/Pixar/Frozen". 

This is gonna be bad thing for indies and even anime industry
So Disney is gonna put classic Fox movies to their vault
China Virus: Let me kill peo--
Vaccines: I AM THE STORM THAT IS APPROACHING PROVOKING BLACK CLOUDS AND ISOLATION I AM RECLAIMER OF MY NAME BORN IN FLAMES I HAVE BEEN BLESSED MY FAMILY CREST IS A DEMON OF DEATH
360 minutes? long as LOTR trilogy?
Its basically Batman TAS with mecha and funnily, S2 was American/Japanese production with some Batman TAS staffs helping Sunrise(who also animated some TAS episodes)
Big O was great
and Tenet got flopped in Japan
At this point, they gonna beat Sonic's Worldwide box office
*Warner Bros and Disney are mad about this because its not Superhero movie ruling cinemas*

I see, we will see about mecha in Yuri manga
Well isn't Japan already dropped restrictions along other asian counties
> also there's apparently a new spinoff for kannazuki no miko
<@161155855524298752> 

Is there's more mechas here
Ah yes...my two favorite genres in one anime
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot9wInkhnVQ
Dark, BADASS, HEATS and also hot blooded
Try Watch Shin Getter Robo Armageddon
Can Nanoha, Hibiki and Sailor Moon beat YuYuYu's Vertexes?
and Fudo turns out to be Armageddon Saotome
How about Sonoko inviting Koji, Tetsuya and Ryoma a KAGAWA LIFE
so Kurumi's time loop will makes sense
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
DAL scenario with Shin Mazinger ZERO plot
Symphogear fits better in SRW than Franxx
<:NotLikeSword:607741098588373025>
> <@!285413253834866689> probably wont happen
<@!279341087494242304> 

Yeah since I bet Bandai will put the worse scenario: Franxx in Console game
just like New Getter
so I wanna see Getter Team punching those Heavenly Gods who putting Yuna a curse
I want Yuuki Yuuna in SRW
<:Ver:704169051391524875>
Uprising was just like they riding to Franxx hype ride
Pacific Rim was literally a tribute to old mecha anime tho
Mycanae Empire was from Mazinger and the enemies of Great Mazinger(and Mazinger in other incarnations)
while Getter Robo was elderich horror cosmotic badass mecha action
Voltes V and Getter are Super Robots although Voltes V was basically revolutionary against corrupt government(as today, my country still using it as symbol of revolution)
with the help of Great Mazinger and Mazinger Z
Its literally all mechas and implied all anime rebelling against ZERO himself
the ending was so awesome
> <@!285413253834866689> give me now
<@!279341087494242304> 

I want that too. I want ZERO being animated like how C-Shadow
Getter Robo>>>>>>>>Franxx
STONER SUNSHINE
Aww
and of course mindfuck even more
Rated R-action scenes, bleeding mechas and also brutality level of Devilman/Violence Jack
How about Shin Mazinger ZERO anime?
CDA would flesh out Haman and Char more as well Char's transition to "MUH LALAH" in CCA
GUNDAM CDA would be cool
Strike Witches in SRW would be hilarously badass
and i can't take Gendo seriously because he voiced Boss in Mazinkaiser OVAs
There's Koji x Asuka ship from SRW games
Same for Asuka
Rei is bae tho
Misato tried
as he points that Nerv are just heartless organization
That's why Bright criticized Nerv in SRW games
Shinji in SRW proves that he can not always acting to be whiny bitch if he has GOOD support like Kamille, Ryoma, Amuro and Tetsuya
Nobody supports him either
I rather rewatching Getter Robo Armageddon <:GenjuroLaugh:689563633516150872>
Shinji is still a whiny bitch
Trying to rewatching Evangelion
and Nanoha teached Vivio how to befriend people
and OMG THOSE THIGHS
Its funnier that it was based to doll figure series
Assault Lily is gud and its very gay
Goodnight
No episode count yet so i hope its 13 eps
or if Imagawa can get out of his retirement, Shin Great
I want Shin Mazinger ZERO anime so we can get Gloriously violent OVA anime as Violence Jack
HEATS 2021 is gonna be OP
because ya know, they want to pander Western Wing fans
Although i bet Sunrise will rather make for worse choice: Gundam Wing Frozen Teardrop anime
and also we need Gundam Space Pirates
We finally getting full Getter Emperor in animated before Waiting Guntaka and Wakaba x Hinata as well TamaAnzu animated moments
and NoWaYu fans as well despite Nogi Wakaba is a Hero always dominates in "Manga/LN most wanted to get anime adaptation" polls
Now I feel so bad for Crossbone Gundam fans
And it implies that we gonna get Mazinger ZERO anime someday
At least for what i heard its gonna be OVA anime
<:GenjuroThumbsUp:336657189475188740>
I'm glad to prove that the genre is still alive
Mecha twitter is exploding like ZERO

Same energt
<@155150213445582850> They gonna adapt the final saga
and in foot Baron Ashura in SRW Z2
And various non mecha units like those Bomus from Fullmetal Panic
Tekkaman Blade wasn't mecha but power armor and he was in SRW
Karen went Non Non Dayo against Char
Revue Starlight in SRW would be hilarious as hell
YUUSHA (ROCKETO) PUNCH
and also a True Revue Starlight collab
I would love that
Nanoha Reflection was meh, Detonation was good but Emoha was just forcdd
NoWaYu anime when
even Yuki Yuna is doing better and I love YuYuYu
I just sad that how Nanoha franchise went..
Symphogear was awesome, it was spiritual successor to Nanoha
and it wasn't even about Valkyrias singing shit while shooting
Strike Witches is unironically the best Macross show we got
He got a good taste
and years later, he did direct Shin Godzilla
He was just fan of the series
Anno owns the complete set of DVD according to his blog
as well the most important, Strike Witches fan
It sad that Western Evangelion fans are denial about Anno being Ultraman, Mecha fan
Yes basically
since Getter manga are WAY darker and Getter Robo Armageddon was the closest we got manga tone
Eva being Apocalypse story was homage to Ishikawa's Getter Robo manga
A.T Field was their trump cards
Eva's weapons are bit mediocre
Anno loves Go Nagai and Ken Ishikawa too
Unless Trans AM Exia can kill it easily
That's their advantage
Even Mazinger Z's Breast Fire can burn the internals
Yeah, Eva are pretty weak
and most importantly, he loves Strike Witches
Plus Anno worked in Char's Counterattack as Mechanic Animator
and Ideon
since Evangelion was inspired by Ultraman
They're more like Ultraman-like dudes
They came from Adam
Let's continue
Since they're Mecha Musumes
Strike Witches?
Same day as Godzilla vs Kong in same month as well same week as Gundam Hathaway Flash movie

Yea
Belrrg.. that Fanbase
Different Story and Wraith Arc
Madoka mangas are good but in fact that they're questionable canon was eg
Madoka was pretty good
YEP

Who's waiting for this
That's only good things
Fuck that Ching Chong propaganda
That's good but not Uprising
Yee and it really does
Pacific Rim fandom is bit dead
Yeah...sadly not big as MCU and DCEU

Godzilla and Kong fanbases are having fun of each other
Soppo tho
RO yus
UMP45 animated even she got one in Healing Chapter
Arknights has subtle story like DOOM
At least we have Monke fighting Lizard before preparing for PTSD feels
GFL has PTSD ohgodohfuck
GFL anime will be good
Azur Lane anime sucked because the writer was Guilty Crown
Yep, Samuel is asshat and i never trusted him at the first place
M16 Episode in DOOM anime would be about Doomguy fighting SF
He got the fanboyism for him
and M16 cameo so GFL anime will have DOOM Crossover Episode
with some bit dialogue and Master Chief cameo
No dialogue, just Doomguy, Samuel Hayden and his bullshit against Demons
DOOM will get anime first before Genshin
Arknights anime never until Warner Bros finished RestoredTheSnyderVerse thing
I hope WB won't fuck it up
GETTER TOMAHAWK
<:CarolSmug:617040484111745027>
Yeah and also it feels like Symphogear girls singing while *GIANT ROBOS ARE EXPLODING THEIR ENEMIES*
<:KirikaAYAYA:588101498026721367>
Watch Mazinger Z and Getter Robo thx
This MAD is so much HYPE

BIG BANG GETTER BEAM PUNCH

Thank you, Usagi Tsukino! You made us reborn with your magic!

And thank you, Ganaha Hibiki! You defeated Queen Beryl!

Thanks to you, the sacrifice for the ritual has fallen right into our hands! It is... the blood of the Heavenly Gods!

Now, the gods of Shinju-sama will be reborn!
-Zoisite & Kunzite (Just making my own scenario of Shin Mazinger-like but with Magical Girls)

They better put Bandori and Million Live Reference on it since it has Aimi
